– Identity Thief, starring Melissa McCarthy as a con artist who swinds people's credit cards, has a lousy 4% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: "Think of this as a movie review or as just a friendly warning from a like-minded individual: Identity Thief is so bad it’s hard to believe it wasn’t directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers," writes Claudia Puig at USA Today. "McCarthy is a comic force of nature, but she can’t save this movie." The film is "so bad it’s hard to believe it wasn’t directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers," writes Rene Rodriguez at the Miami Herald.

– The latest entry in the Alien prequel series, Alien: Covenant, tells the story of a crew that sets off on a seven-year journey to a new planet. But when the ship's captain dies and the crew finds a potential new home, they have to make a choice—and it's a big one. Here's what critics are saying: "Alien: Covenant is the best Alien film since the original, and perhaps the best ever," writes Peter Travers at Rolling Stone. It's "beautifully made" and "satisfying," he writes, and "the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow." Michael Fassbender "gives a towering performance" and Billy Crudup is "excellent," writes Peter Travers at Rolling Stone. But the film "feels like a missed opportunity to engage in some religion vs. science debate." It's "a well-crafted sci-fi thriller that keeps you on edge, and entertained, for two hours," writes Manohla Dargis at the New York Times. Fassbender "is the best performance of the bunch," she writes, and the film "is a reminder that good actors can make good movies." But at the AP, Joe Morgens

– France is taking a preemptive strike against the anti-Islam film that sparked worldwide protests, with the government today announcing that it will close all its embassies and schools in 20 countries tomorrow, Reuters reports. "We have indeed decided as a precautionary measure to close our premises, embassies, consulates, cultural centers, and schools," says a Foreign Ministry spokesman. The move comes after the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed that it says are in line with free speech. Among the cartoons, which were published in full today, are one showing Mohammed in a wheelchair being pushed by an Orthodox Jew, and another showing Mohammed exposing his butt to a film director, the BBC reports. "We reject and condemn the French cartoons that dishonor the Prophet," says the head of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.

– Herman Cain's campaign is staying mum, but the candidate's new gospel album has appeared on the Internet. Sunday Morning, a 13-track album recorded in the late 1990s, is "a soulful baritone crooning," according to the Daily Caller, which notes that the album "recalls the early recordings of the Supreme Court" and "certainly wins the prize for funnest danceable track." Mediaite reports that the album was released by a gospel label called GLC Music, Selah Sound Production & Melodic Praise Records, and that Cain himself recorded vocals. The Daily Caller notes that Cain's band includes guitarist Thaddeus McCotter and that the album is not being distributed by the Cain campaign.

– The estranged wife of a world-renowned concert pianist has been ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial for allegedly smothering the couple's two young daughters by smothering them with pillows. Sofya Tsygankova has been ordered committed to a state mental health facility for 120 days of treatment with the hope that she will be able to face justice when she regains "a reasonable degree of rational understanding," court records revealed Wednesday, per the New York Daily News. Tsygankova, 32, who is charged with capital murder of a person under age 10, will remain in the Tarrant County jail until a bed becomes available at the mental health facility. Tsygankova had visited a state mental health facility in Fort Worth a day before her daughters were found dead, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Police said that when Vadym Kholodenko arrived at his wife's home March 17 to pick up the girls and take them to preschool, he found Tsygankova covered in blood with cuts on her wrists and the two children dead in their beds.

– The editor-in-chief of the New York Review of Books has been forced out over a controversial essay he wrote about former Canadian broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi. Ian Buruma, who was forced out of his job Wednesday, published an essay in the magazine titled "In the Dark: The CBC and the Dark Side of the #MeToo Movement" in which Ghomeshi, who was acquitted in 2016 of sexual assault and choking allegations, described his experience as a heterosexual man who was "blackballed" by society. The essay was strongly criticized by women's rights groups and other critics who said it minimized the serious allegations against Ghomeshi and gave a false account of his behavior. Buruma, who had been editor since 2013, defended his decision to publish the essay in a Dutch magazine, the Guardian reports. "As editor of the New York Review of Books I published a theme issue about #MeToo offenders who had not been convicted in a court of law but by social media. And now I myself am publicly pilloried," he said. Buruma, who had faced criticism for not mentioning that more than 20 women had accused Ghomeshi of sexual abuse or harassment, said he was forced out over "a mistake in judgment" and that he had "compassion

– Divers in Mexico have made an amazing discovery: the world's longest underwater cave. They've connected two flooded caverns on the Yucatan peninsula, forming a 215-mile-long system that National Geographic calls "the most important submerged archaeological site in the world." The Gran Acuifero Maya Project says the cave system, known as Sac Actun, once stretched 163 miles but has been connected to the Dos Ojos system, which stretches 83 miles and is believed to be the world's longest flooded cave. The two systems communicate through tunnels and galleries in the cave, which is home to hundreds of archaeological sites, including evidence of the first settlers in America and Mayan culture, Reuters reports. "This immense cave represents the most important submerged archaeological site in the world, since it has more than a hundred archaeological contexts, among which is evidence of the first settlers of America, as well as the extinct fauna and, of course, of the Maya culture," says GAM director Guillermo de Anda. The discovery of the Dos Ojos system, which is connected to the Sac Actun system by a network of tunnels, will allow researchers to "appreciate much more clearly how the rituals, the pilgrimage sites, and ultimately the great pre-Hispanic settlements that we know

– A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Dallas had to return to Seattle on Sunday because a human heart meant for donation had been left on the plane, the Seattle Times reports. The heart had arrived in Seattle from Sacramento, where it was supposed to be unloaded, but someone forgot to do so before the plane left for Dallas. The pilot announced the flight would turn around over Idaho because the "life-critical cargo shipment" was still on the plane. The heart was unloaded after three hours in the air, but Southwest says it was necessary to return to Seattle "as quickly as possible." The heart was unharmed and reached its intended destination on time, CNN reports. Passenger Andrew Gottschalk, a doctor who cares for professional athletes, says the incident was a "horrific story of gross negligence," no matter where the heart was supposed to go.

– A 3-year-old boy is in stable condition after falling into a jaguar exhibit at the Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas yesterday, KTHV reports. The incident took place in a cat exhibit, and police say the boy's father saw him fall into the enclosure and threw items at the animals to keep them at bay. One of the animals, a jaguar, reportedly bit the boy on the back of the neck. A keeper heard screams for help and ran over to see one of the jaguars with its mouth around the boy's neck. Zoo workers called for help with a fire extinguisher, and a staffer climbed into the exhibit with a ladder to get the boy out, Arkansas Matters reports. The boy was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for extensive scalp lacerations, a depressed skull fracture, and minor puncture wounds. The boy's condition has been upgraded to stable and he is expected to improve, a hospital spokesman says.

– A Bloomingdale's catalog ad is drawing more than a few laughs for what some are calling "creepy" sexual references. The ad shows a woman laughing as a man looks in her direction. The text reads: "Spike Your Best Friend's Eggnog When They're Not Looking." The Wall Street Journal reports that the ad has been criticized on social media by nearly 4,000 people, most of whom called it "creepy." The department store has apologized for the ad, which it says was "inappropriate and in poor taste." It's not clear what the intent of the ad was, but branding experts say that advertisers are under pressure to stand out in a crowded market. "Marketers have to work harder to get attention nowadays, but the more they try, the riskier it becomes," says a branding firm's CEO.

– The Catholic priest who had a long-term relationship with a California school superintendent has taken a leave of absence. Nancy Kotowski, 59, and Rev. Mike Manning, 70, are cousins on Kotowski's mother's side and didn't grow up together, she tells the Monterey Herald. Manning left for the seminary when he was 14, and she was 3. "We're soul mates, and in any human relationship, especially one of over 30 years, you reach a decision-making point, and our relationship reached that point," Kotowski says. She says the relationship ended about three years ago, and she and Manning are now embracing celibacy. "It's a 30-year relationship of love for one another," she says. "That's what it was." Manning has stepped away from Wordnet TV, a worldwide Catholic television ministry based in San Bernardino, a spokesman for the diocese says.

– President Trump has been making his displeasure known about the Federal Reserve for a while now, and he has now taken his criticism to the bank's own chairman. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump says Fed Chairman Jerome Powell "almost looks like he's happy raising interest rates." The president, who last week called the central bank his "biggest threat," also says he "maybe" regretted nominating Powell to the position, though he acknowledges it's "too early to tell, but maybe." The Fed has raised rates three times this year, and Powell has warned that the current pace of increases is "going too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion." Trump, who complained that former President Obama was able to operate with "zero interest" rates, also took note of the Fed's role in allowing the economy to grow after the 2008 recession, NBC News reports. "How the hell do you compete with that?" he asked. The Journal notes that presidents have long avoided commenting on the Fed, which is supposed to be immune to political pressure, but Trump's remarks are notable because he has been making his case to voters that the economy is in great shape. Earlier this month, he told Fox Business that the Fed was "going loco" and "out

– A California news station is taking heat for airing a photo of a slain teen that many see as racist. Nia Wilson, 18, was stabbed to death on a train Sunday night in Oakland, and the photo of her holding what appears to be a gun was shown on KTVU's This Week with George Stephanopoulos Monday. The station said it was a "tasteless" choice and explained that it was taken from Wilson's Instagram account. But many saw it as racist, and the station has been criticized for it. "It's a gun. It's a knife. It's a knife," a viewer tells KTVU. "It's racist. It's a horrible, horrible thing." "I think it gives us a real glimpse into the sick of exactly who we are dealing with and fighting against," the mother of Wilson, who was black, wrote on her Facebook page. "They interrupt our grief because they don't even really see us as fully human." She also criticized the station for airing the photo the day after Wilson's death, and for showing white supremacists at a vigil for her. "How cruel, how evil, how heartless, how crass, how foul do you have to be, how rotten must you be

– Democrats kick off day two of their convention tonight, with a big speech from Bill Clinton, who will urge voters to re-elect President Obama and defend his own record, reports the AP. Some other highlights: Clinton will urge voters to re-elect Obama, saying that "the president has the experience and the leadership to lead our country again," reports the New York Times. He will also urge voters to re-elect Scott Brown, saying that he has "the experience and the leadership to do it." Brown, meanwhile, will accuse Clinton of working with Republicans to raise taxes. He will also accuse Clinton of "class warfare," saying that Democrats have been unable to show that Obama has a "sense of fairness." Sandra Fluke will speak, and she'll be joined by Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard professor who is running for the Senate in Massachusetts. She will focus on the issue of abortion, and Rush Limbaugh will be a no-show, reports USA Today. Obama campaign officials downplayed questions about Clinton's speech, saying it is a "mountain out of a molehill," reports Bloomberg. "This is a mountain out of a molehill.

– Julian Assange has written a letter to Benedict Cumberbatch, and it's not pretty. The WikiLeaks founder, who plays him in the new movie The Fifth Estate, says he tried to contact Cumberbatch before shooting began, but he declined, reports the Hollywood Reporter. "My assistants communicated your request to me, and I have given it a lot of thought and examined your previous work, which I am fond of," Assange writes. "I think I would enjoy meeting you. ... I believe that you are a good person, but I do not believe that this film is a good film. Your skills play into the hands of people who are out to remove me and WikiLeaks from the world." He also slams the movie, which is based on the book Inside WikiLeaks by Daniel Domscheit-Berg, as "the next most toxic, biased book" about WikiLeaks. "I believe that it is going to be overwhelmingly negative for me and the people I care about," writes Assange. "It is based on a deceitful book by someone who has a vendetta against me and my organization." Click for more.

– Pope Francis is set to deliver his much-anticipated environmental encyclical Thursday, and scientists say it could have a bigger impact than international negotiations this year on climate change. "I'm not a religious person at all," a NASA climatologist tells USA Today. "But it's just unbelievable." The pope's teaching letter, or encyclical, is expected to call for climate action and urge the world to care for the poor, the New York Times reports. "The encyclical is going to go out to over 1 billion Catholics—that's a way of getting a message across to a segment of society that the scientific community could never do," says Jeff Kiehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. "I mean it's just unbelievable." The pope has spoken out on the environment before, and he shifted the discussion to the environment during a meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last year, says Robert Orr, Ban's special adviser on climate change. "This is the pope of the poor," Orr tells the Times. "The fact that he is making the link to the planet is really significant." The pope has already faced criticism from conservative Catholic writers and figures, including Rick Santorum, who says the church has "gotten it wrong a few

– The latest Herman Cain ad is here, and it's getting plenty of attention for a few reasons: The chief of staff is smoking. It's a little unclear, but here's what people are saying: The ad features chief of staff Mark Block talking proudly about the campaign, until he reveals he's smoking. "We’ve run a campaign like nobody’s ever seen," he says. "But then, America’s never seen a candidate like Herman Cain." The scene ends with a smiling Cain giving a sidelong smile. Mediaite rounds up five theories: The smoking could be a reference to the media scrutiny that has dogged Cain in recent days, or it could be a way for Cain to prove that he's not your average politician. The chief of staff is a "mustachioed" guy who has "never been in the public eye," and he's not used to it, writes John Dickerson at Slate. He could be trying to show that he's not "the crazy Herman Cain of old." The cigarette could be a reference to the media scrutiny that has dogged Cain, or it could be a way for Cain to prove that he's not anti-tobacco. The smoking could be a way for

– Melania Trump made her first public comments on her husband's 2005 "hot mic" tape Monday, and she made a point to say that she believes her husband, CNN reports. "I believe my husband. I believe my husband," she said. "This was all organized from the opposition. And with the details ... did they ever check the background of these women? They don't have any facts." She said she hadn't heard her husband use the kind of language he was heard saying in the tape, and that she was "surprised" he was "egged on" by the opposition. She said the mainstream media is trying to hurt her and her family by "saying lies about me, lies about my family." She said the 2005 tape was not made by her husband, and that any other allegations of sexual misconduct should be handled in court. Melania Trump also said she would tell women who were scared by the scandal: "My husband is kind and he's a gentleman. He cares about people. He cares about women." She said it's fair for the media to bring up Bill Clinton'sinfidelities during the campaign, Fox News reports. "They're asking for it. They started," she said. "They started from

– Wendy Davis' memoir hits shelves next week, and the Texas Democrat's most personal story yet is emerging in a draft obtained by the San Antonio Express-News. Davis writes that she and her then-husband made the decision to end their pregnancy 17 years ago after doctors told them the baby had an acute brain abnormality. She was delivered by cesarean section, and Davis writes that she and her husband spent a day with the baby before having her baptized. "An indescribable blackness followed," she writes. "It was a deep, dark despair and grief, a heavy wave that crushed me, that made me wonder if I would ever surface. ... And when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person. Changed. Forever changed." Davis has previously revealed that she had an abortion in 2011 after an ectopic pregnancy, but this is the first time she reveals the pregnancy with Tate Elise, which happened after she and her husband decided to end the pregnancy because she was suffering. The book, Getting to Be Afraid, is out on Tuesday.

– A California restaurant has fired a waiter who asked four women—including one who's an immigrant—to prove they were US residents before serving them their food. Diana Carrillo, 24, says she was seated with her sister and friends at Saint Marc Pub-Cafe in Pacific City last week when the waiter asked her, "Can I see your proof of residency?" She says she was shocked. "I already had my ID out. I couldn't say anything," she tells the Orange County Register. Carrillo says the waiter told the other three women the same thing, saying, "I need to make sure you're residents before I serve you." After the women left, Carrillo posted the incident on social media, where it has since gone viral. The restaurant apologized and said in part, "This type of behavior is not representative of the St. Marc brand and will not be tolerated." The senior director of operations at St. Marc, Kent Berden, says he fired the waiter, who he says didn't follow corporate policy. He says the waiter thought the question was asked "in a joking fashion," but Carrillo says he showed no hint of humor and had a "bad vibe." She says she declined the restaurant's offer to be a VIP guest and invited the

– A Florida teen who shot and killed a retired Florida Highway Patrol trooper's police dog was convicted of animal cruelty yesterday and sentenced to 23 years in prison, the Palm Beach Post reports. Ivins Rosier, 16, shot and killed 5-year-old Drake in November 2012, and was charged as an adult for the crime. But since Drake was retired and the law treats killing a dog differently than killing a human, Rosier was tried as an adult and convicted. His lawyers plan to appeal. Rosier's lawyers argued that the teen was too young to have committed the crime and that the evidence was insufficient to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

– The Cleveland police officer who fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice last year told a grand jury Tuesday that he opened fire because he thought the boy was a threat to himself and his partner, the Guardian reports. "The suspect had a gun, had been threatening others with the weapon, and had not obeyed our command to show us his hands," officer Timothy Loehmann said in his statement to the grand jury. "I observed the suspect pulling the gun out of waistband and his elbow coming up." Loehmann said he told Tamir to raise his hands repeatedly as the boy was "reaching into his waistband." "With his hands pulling the gun out and his elbow coming up, I knew it was a gun and it was coming out," Loehmann said. "The threat to my partner and myself was real and active." Loehmann and partner Frank Garmback, both white, are being considered for indictment for the shooting. The grand jury is currently considering whether to indict them. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reports that in his statement, Garmback admitted that the patrol car "did not stop where and when I intended." Lawyers for the Rice family say Loehmann's statement is "a stunning irregularity" and call it a "stunning

– Oprah Winfrey is planning to build a mansion and guest home on her Colorado property, but it looks like she'll have to do so without access to trails that have been open to neighbors for decades. Retired physicist Charles D. Goodman claims Winfrey's Yellow Brick Road company, the property's former owners, and the town of Mountain Village made a secret deal to close access to the trails that cut across the land purchased for $10.9 million in March, the AP reports. The Denver Post reported yesterday that the former owners, Hoyt and Carol Barnett, asked for a correction to property records shortly before selling the land. Goodman claims that erased easements allowing residents of nearby homes to use the trails. Mountain Village denies the accusation. Town community development director Chirs Hawkins said the correction only cleared up ambiguities and that the town and Winfrey's team want to continue to allow trail access. In a written statement, Yellow Brick Road spokeswoman Wendy Luckenbill said the company will continue to work with the neighbors ensure "reasonable" access for neighbors over portions of the land.

– The White House is considering four options for reining in the NSA's controversial phone-surveillance program, and all four are "very, very hard to imagine," a senior administration official tells the Wall Street Journal. One option would have the NSA running the program, but it would require the cooperation of phone companies. The other three would have the NSA retaining the data, but giving it to another government agency, or keeping it and giving it to phone companies but giving them control over it. The fourth option would have the NSA retaining the data but giving it to phone companies, but giving them control over it. President Obama has said he wants to do away with the program entirely, but the Journal reports that he's leaning more toward one of the three others. "A daring proposal, but come on, this one's a pipe dream," says the official.

– The 59-year-old who killed two people and wounded nine others in a Lafayette, La., movie theater Thursday night had been arrested and ticketed for a variety of offenses over the past decade or so, including charges of arson and selling alcohol to a minor, the AP reports. Police officials say John Russel Houser's arrests date 10 to 15 years ago or more. Those include charges of arson and selling alcohol to a minor. He had been married once in the past but was not currently married. In Alabama, records show Houser had four speeding tickets and one no-seat ticket between 1981 and 2003. He asked for $1,800 to pay his emergency room bill and for a narcotics prescription. The case was settled, according to court records. Police say Houser's arrest record in Alabama includes charges of arson and selling alcohol to a minor. He was also arrested in Georgia in 2005 and 2006 for crimes including theft and possession of a firearm by a felon. He was granted a temporary protective order against him in 2008, the AP reports. The filing says Houser's wife, Kellie Houser, "has become so worried about the defendant's volatile mental state that she has removed all guns and/or weapons from their marital residence."

– Virginia's new governor was asleep Saturday night when he woke to a picture of his predecessor and a message from him: "Sleep when you're dead." It was the latest in a long line of pranks pulled by outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe on his successor, the Washington Post reports. Ralph Northam found the image of McAuliffe on his pillowcase as he and his wife, first lady Pam Northam, spent their first night in the Governor's Mansion. "There are pictures of the governor all over the mansion that he left for me," Northam says. "Also, at 3 o'clock this morning, an alarm clock went off, which I have yet to find. I texted him and thanked him, and he said there was more to come." The New York Daily News notes that such pranks are common in Virginia, the only state where the governor's office changes hands every four years. (Mark Warner left a life-size cutout of himself in the governor's mansion shower for Tim Kaine.)

– The doctor who was targeted by a former doctor who opened fire at a Bronx-Lebanon Hospital on Friday says he was surprised to be singled out. Dr. Kamran Ahmed says he wasn't the only one Henry Bello had a problem with. Bello "had a problem with almost everybody, so I'm not the only one," the doctor tells the New York Post. "That's why they fired him, because so many people complained." Bello, who killed one doctor and injured six others before killing himself, "never argued with me," Ahmed says. "I don't know why he put my name." Bello, who was a family medicine doctor, had been forced to resign from the hospital in 2015 amid a sexual harassment scandal, the AP reports. In an email to the New York Daily News before the shooting, Bello blamed colleagues for forcing him to resign. "This hospital terminated my road to a licensure to practice medicine," the email said. "First, I was told it was because I always kept to myself. Then it was because of an altercation with a nurse." Bello had warned his former colleagues when he was forced out in 2015 that he would return someday to kill them. Ahmed was not working Friday. Instead, Bello, dressed in a white

– The Weinstein Company has filed for bankruptcy, days after a New York state judge ordered Harvey Weinstein to hand over millions in assets to the state as part of a settlement with several women who accused him of sexual misconduct. The company's board said in a statement that it has entered into a deal with an affiliate of private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners to buy substantially all of its assets, reports the Guardian. The company, which has around 100 employees, said it is releasing all employees from non-disclosure agreements, which New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman called a "watershed moment," Variety reports. "Since October, it has been reported that Harvey Weinstein used non-disclosure agreements as a secret weapon to silence his accusers," the board said. "Effective immediately, those ' agreements' end." The company said it plans to sell its assets to the Lantern affiliate, which has agreed to bid at an auction. "While we had hoped to reach a sale out of court, the Board is pleased to have a plan for maximizing the value of its assets, preserving as many jobs as possible, and pursuing justice for any victims," said Chairman Bob Weinstein. The company's bankruptcy filing in Delaware lists $500 million to $1 billion in liabilities and up to $1 billion in assets, reports the

– Siri's been having a rough couple of weeks. The voice-controlled assistant for the iPhone 4S let out a not-so-pleasant verbal expletive to a 12-year-old when she asked her how many people there are in the world, and she may have been tricked by pranksters into thinking she was the phone's owner, reports CNET. The boy's mother was a little surprised when Siri's reply to the question "How many people are there in the world?" blared out. "I thought I must be hearing things," she said. "So we asked again and the same four-letter stuff blared out." The boy's mother took the phone back to Tesco, where the store manager told the Sun that Siri may have been tricked by a group of pranksters into thinking the phrase "How many people are in the world with the phone owner's name" was in fact the name of the user. Tesco is investigating, and the store's manager says Siri may have been given the wrong name in the set-up instructions.

– New evidence is adding to the case against Danish inventor Peter Madsen, who is accused of murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall aboard his home-made submarine in August. Per Reuters, police say they have found video on Madsen's computer that "we presume to be real" showing women being strangled and decapitated. Madsen, who has said Wall died accidentally during a trip aboard the submarine, says the video on his computer is not his. He says it's the work of others in his laboratory, where he was working on building space rockets. Police say they also found blood on Wall's body and evidence of stab wounds "around or shortly after her death," the Guardian reports. Madsen, who appeared in court via video link, says the computer found by police is not his. "They are the space laboratory's tools which have been used by everyone in the laboratory," he says. He says he's "not the only person" with access to the computer in his workshop and the extreme content on it doesn't belong to him. Madsen, 46, has been charged with murder, which carries a sentence of life, and mutilating her body. He has told the court he tried to bury Wall's body at sea, but DNA tests have yet

– John Thune won’t be joining the GOP field of 2012 hopefuls. “For months now, my wife Kimberley and I have received encouragement from family, friends, colleagues, and supporters from across South Dakota and the country to run for the presidency of the United States,” the South Dakota senator said today. Thune said he decided against a run because he’s focused on his Senate duties, Politico reports. “I feel that I am best positioned to fight for America’s future here in the trenches of the United States Senate,” he said.

– More than two years after being declared brain dead, Jahi McMath is "healthy and beautiful as ever, proving the naysayers wrong," her family says in a Facebook post. The post, which includes a picture of the California 15-year-old and her mother, Nailah Winkfield, was posted March 15 and has been shared more than 5,600 times, Fox News reports. "A fighter, A warrior, A blessed child, Gods got your back little girl, keep fighting," the post reads. "Prayers going up from many, all the prayers, good wishes combined with your mothers love for you which is pure and soothing will definitely keep you going." Winkfield has filed a federal lawsuit to have Jahi's death certificate declared void, NJ.com reports. She has also been fighting to have Jahi moved to another medical facility.

– President Trump has returned to his West Palm Beach golf course on another sunny Florida day. Trump began his Friday on Twitter, saying Democrats and Republicans "MUST come together, finally, with a major Border Security package, which will include funding for the Wall." He says it's "time for action," even though the idea is opposed by many Democrats, who recently won control of the House, per the AP. Trump also calls on Congress to pass criminal justice reform legislation. He says Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer "have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country." But Trump tweeted at the wrong account, tagging a Schumer fan instead of the senator. For Thanksgiving, Trump called troops, answered reporters' questions, visited a Coast Guard station, and had dinner at his Mar-a-Lago club. The Hill reports that Trump has kept the door open to a potential government shutdown if an upcoming deal to fund parts of the government does not include funding for a border wall. Congress has until Dec. 7 to fund the rest of the government after lawmakers punted on seven of the 12 individual funding bills before the end-of-the-fiscal-year deadline.

– A woman has been robbing jewelry stores in the South since April, and authorities now believe she may be working with an accomplice, the New York Daily News reports. According to WNCN, the FBI released several photos of the woman and a man believed to be her partner in crime after a Jared Vault store in Mebane, NC, was robbed Monday. Police say the woman showed up at the store with a gun, tied up employees, and made them go into a back room, where she put jewelry cases in a shopping bag. The FBI says the woman has hit six stores in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and North Carolina since April. In the most recent heist, she allegedly tied up two employees before making off with an undisclosed amount of jewelry. Authorities say the woman and the man are armed and dangerous.

– A great white shark has been tagged by the Ocearch organization as it cruises the East Coast, the Boston Globe reports. The creature was photographed by Maryleelee Lee, a member of the group who tagged the shark with a GPS device. "It's the first time we've had a great white tagged and photographed while on the East Coast," says Bo Petersen, the group's director. "It's a big deal." The shark was photographed about 100 miles off the coast of Gloucester, Mass., in the waters off Cape Cod. Petersen says the group hopes to tag more sharks.

– A Secret Service agent says she won't defend President Trump if someone tries to shoot him—and she's not going to violate a law that keeps her from saying so publicly. In a series of Facebook posts, Senior Agent Kerry O'Grady, who oversees advance teams for presidential trips to Washington, DC, says she has changed her mind and would "take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here," the Washington Examiner reports. " Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her." O'Grady, who endorsed Hillary Clinton during the campaign and says she won't honor the Hatch Act, deleted the posts shortly after the Examiner reported them. In another post, she says she won't honor the law because it makes it illegal for her to "take a bullet for both sides." "As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act. So I keep quiet and skirt the median," she wrote in the now-deleted post. "To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides. But this world has changed and I have

– A DNA test that claims to predict a person's risk of certain diseases is a big hit with consumers, but the FDA is not amused. The agency has ordered 23andMe to stop marketing its Personal Genome Service, saying it violates the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because it doesn't have the proper approval, reports the Wall Street Journal. The test, which costs around $60, can predict a person's risk of diabetes, breast cancer, and other diseases, but the FDA says it should be used only for the "diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease." The company, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., says it will comply. 23andMe has been selling the test since at least 2009, but the FDA's warning letter suggests that it's been too long since the agency has reviewed the product. The company says it will comply with the agency's request to halt marketing until it gets answers about the safety and effectiveness of the test.

– The Golden State Warriors somehow withstood LeBron James' latest brilliance on the NBA Finals stage. A costly blunder by JR Smith and a disputed foul call involving James himself sure helped. Stephen Curry scored 29 points and the Warriors capitalized on Smith's mistake that sent the game into overtime, overcoming a 51-point performance by James to beat Cleveland 124-114 in Game 1 on Thursday night, per the AP. The game nearly over, James jawed with both Curry and Klay Thompson, then Tristan Thompson and Draymond Green tangled moments later and made contact. After replay review, Tristan Thompson received a Flagrant 2 foul and ejection with 2.6 seconds left. James was in utter disbelief as regulation ended stunningly: George Hill made the first of two free throws with 4.7 seconds left after being fouled by Klay Thompson, but when Smith secured the rebound of the second, he dribbled back toward halfcourt instead of shooting, apparently thinking the Cavs had a lead. "He thought it was over. He thought we were up one," coach Tyronn Lue said. Yet Smith insisted he knew the score. Green figured Smith was simply looking for James, saying, "I would have looked for LeBron, too." The Cavs and the Warriors have met in every NBA Finals since 2015. The teams are

– Artificial sweeteners, used in diet drinks and other foods to help people lose weight, may not help people lose weight at all. That's according to a new study, which found no evidence the sweeteners help people lose weight or reduce weight at all. Instead, they appear to be linked to weight gain and an increased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, and other health issues, reports CTV News. "I think the takeaway for Canadians at this point is to maybe think twice about whether you really want to be consuming these artificial sweeteners, particularly on an everyday basis," says study author Meghan Azad of the University of Manitoba. Azad and her team reviewed 37 studies that looked at the diets of more than 400,000 people. Seven studies were randomized controlled trials, meaning they followed a set of participants for a short period of time. The other 30 studies were longer-term observational studies that followed participants for an average of 10 years. "A lot of the studies we found were observational, meaning they could show a link but they can't prove a cause-and-effect relationship," says Azad. The researchers also found no consistent benefits in helping the needle go down on the scale or slimming the waist. While the results are not conclusive, Azad says they are in line with other studies that

– A man suspected of killing a Texas state trooper during a traffic stop was taken into custody more than 100 miles away, authorities said Thursday night. The Harris County Sheriff's Office announced on Twitter that the suspect was apprehended in neighboring Waller County. The Texas Department of Public Safety and other law enforcement agencies had identified the suspect as Dabrett Black, 32, of Linsdale, Texas, the AP reports. DPS said the trooper was shot and killed before 4pm Thursday during a traffic stop on Interstate 45 near Fairfield, about 90 miles south of Dallas. The trooper was shot with a rifle and died at the scene, the agency said. The suspect then fled. Hours after the shooting, the Waller County Sheriff's Office said the suspect's vehicle was spotted in Hempstead, about 110 miles south of Fairfield. The sheriff's office said on its Facebook page that shots were fired, but did not indicate who opened fire. The suspect was apprehended a short time later. Several Texas officials reacted to the trooper's death. In a tweet, US Sen. Ted Cruz offered "prayers for the family and loved ones" of the trooper. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the trooper's killing a "heinous crime" in a statement Thursday. Abbott also expressed his "

– If you're looking to boost your child's chances of being a successful adult, you might want to pick a name that means "lovable," "adorable," "popular," "creative," or "respectful," according to a new book. In fact, "good-looking" names are more likely to be "favorable" than "undesirable," "harmful," or "egocentric," according to Baby Name Report Card, a book created by psychologist Albert Mehrabian. The book includes recommendations from Mehrabian, who says that "parents should discover the impressions that will be generated by the names they select for their children." His research has found that people tend to be more forgiving of people with "undesirable or unattractive names," but he says that names that mean "honest, loyal, sincere, kind, generous, respectful, warm, patient, responsible," and "popular-fun" also tend to be more beneficial. The book includes recommendations from experts including Stephen Colbert, who says that names like Oliver and Noah are "the best" for young people, the Telegraph reports.

– Al Gore has been out of the public eye since losing the popular vote to George W. Bush in 2000, but he's still being talked about as a potential candidate for president in 2016. That's according to a BuzzFeed report that cites "a senior Democrat" and "a member of Gore's inner circle." The Democrat says supporters are starting to get the "old gang together" and talk about a run for the presidency, though other sources say Gore hasn't even started to entertain the idea. "This is people talking to people, some of whom may or may not have talked to him," a Gore adviser says. A Gore spokeswoman tells Politico that there's "no truth to it." "He's laser-focused on solving the climate crisis," she says. "I'd be pretty insulted if there were a group of Gore advisers meeting and I wasn't invited." But Mike Feldman, Gore's traveling chief of staff in the 2000 campaign, says the rumors are coming from "Democrats talking to other Democrats." He adds that Gore has been very quiet in recent months. "I just don't think this is on his mind." A Democratic strategist tells Politico that if Gore were to run, he'd be joined by Joe Biden or

– Iran has issued a denial after reports surfaced that a massive explosion had damaged the country's Fordow nuclear site. The report, which was first posted on a right-wing website, claimed that the blast partially destroyed the site and trapped 240 people underground, the Telegraph reports. Israel, which has a surveillance network monitoring Iran's key nuclear sites, has not been able to confirm the report. "Any explosion in Iran that doesn't hurt people but hurts its assets is welcome," Israel's home defense minister said earlier this week. Iran has accused Israel of trying to sabotage its nuclear program, which Tehran says is entirely peaceful. Reuters has been unable to verify reports of an explosion at Fordow since Friday.

– Facebook is turning 10 today, and the anniversary is being celebrated in style with a slew of new features and a look back at the site’s history. Slate has a timeline of the site’s history, starting with its 2004 launch. It’s a little slow to come together, but the site has grown quickly, and now has 1 million users. The Facebook of today is different from the one Mark Zuckerberg envisioned back in 2004. It’s not an official Facebook, but it’s a lot different than the one Zuckerberg envisioned. It’s a social network for college students, and it’s got no plans to make money. “I assume I’ll eventually make something profitable,” he told the student newspaper. But it’s not too far off, reports the Harvard Crimson. The school is working on an official version, and it should be up and running by the end of the spring semester.

– Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan Saturday to expand funding for community health centers, a move that could open the door for Bernie Sanders to endorse her, reports USA Today. The plan would double funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers, which serve populations with limited access to health care. Community health care centers have been a key priority for Sanders, who successfully fought for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for such centers in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Clinton's proposal also includes giving people under 55 the option of choosing a "public option" insurance plan. "We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable healthcare to everyone in America," Clinton said in a statement. The Clinton campaign also announced that Clinton will support a $15 minimum wage, a key issue for Sanders, reports Reuters.

– For 10 years, Abe Hagenston has been panhandled in Detroit, and he's made it his business to accept credit cards from people offering warmth. But now he's created a website called GiveABeA that allows people to donate to his collection of homeless people, or report fake panhandlers, reports CNN. "I'm trying to turn this situation into something that will not only help me but help others," Hagenston tells the Detroit Free Press. "People don't realize how tough it is to come from nothing when you don't have any family or any friends." Hagenston says he's made it through other rough times, but this winter has been especially tough. "It's not really that easy, what we're lacking is snow," he tells CBS Detroit. "Of course, there's no snow removal. I used to look forward to that, doing some shoveling." Without the extra cash, Hagenston says he could use a new prescription and new eyeglasses, but he says he and a group of fellow homeless have organized themselves "like a union" and have been working in shifts for months. He says he takes credit and debit cards from people with smartphones that have readers attached, and the fees for those transactions are

– A man has been arrested after video surfaced of him allegedly ripping off a teen's "Make America Great Again" hat and throwing a drink in his face at a Whataburger in San Antonio, Texas. The incident, which was caught on video by the teen's mother, happened around 2am Wednesday, the AP reports. In the video, a man can be seen taking off the hat from 16-year-old Hunter Richard and walking away from a group of teens. In a Facebook post, Hunter's mother, Patricia Spittler, says the incident happened after her son and his friends were eating at the restaurant. She says the man in the video became angry when his friend's hat was taken. She says the man in the video yelled a racial slur at Hunter and his friends. The video has been viewed more than 2 million times and is being widely shared online. The teenager tells WOAI that he supports President Trump and doesn't want his hat stolen. "I just think a conversation about it instead of ripping my hat off," he says. The San Antonio Police Department says 30-year-old Kino Jimenez was arrested and charged with theft. He has been fired from his job at a Whataburger. Police say they are investigating the incident.

– At least 13 people, including children, died after a boat carrying tourists capsized and sank on a lake during a thunderstorm in a country music mecca in southwest Missouri, authorities said Friday. Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Jason Pace said four people remain missing Friday after the Ride the Ducks boat sank on Table Rock Lake in Branson Thursday evening. He said 14 people survived, and that seven of them were injured. Patrol divers found two more bodies early Friday, raising the death toll from 11 to 13, Pace said. A spokeswoman for the Cox Medical Center Branson said four adults and three children arrived at the hospital shortly after the incident. Two adults are in critical condition and the others were treated for minor injuries, Brandei Clifton said. Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader said five people remain missing and seven others were hospitalized after a Ride the Ducks boat sank on Table Rock Lake in Branson.

– President Obama's news conference today focused on the Bush tax cuts, and most pundits agree that he made a strong case for ending them. Here's what they're saying: Obama "mounted a surprisingly aggressive moral case for ending high end tax cuts," writes Ezra Klein in the Washington Post. "He was clearly out to pick a major public fight with Republicans over tax cuts for the rich." Obama is trying to reframe the debate "as a battle not over government spending—losing turf for Dems—but over who has the most balanced priorities and who is really working in the interests of the whole country." "While there’s good reason for skepticism that the final deal won’t contain some kind of cost shifting, it was good to hear Obama lay down that marker in those terms," writes Michael Grunwald in the New York Times. "The whole debt-ceiling business is going nowhere." Republicans "correctly reject tax hikes and the president isn’t yet digging in on spending," writes John Dickerson in Slate. "The president is playing politics with the issue, but he’s playing politics with the issue with a strong moral argument." "If you are a wealthy CEO or hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they’ve ver been

– Two Brits who decided to go out drinking and then wake up in Thailand have managed to do so without a single incident. Phillip Boyle and Jamie Blyth, both 33, took two seven-hour flights to the resort city of Pattaya after a Friday night out in Marton, England, where they drank so much they didn't sleep much, the Telegraph reports. They then planned to stay in the beach city until Tuesday. "It's been great," Boyle tells the Gazette. "It's been brilliant fun." Boyle says he didn't even pack a suitcase, just T-shirts and underwear in a grocery bag. He says he and his friends, who knew each other from school, decided to take the stunt because they were confused by the layover in Abu Dhabi and thought, "We're here now so we should just make the most of it." They woke up in the plane, which had a mechanical glitch that delayed it by an hour. "We sobered up on the flight and thought, 'What have we done!'" Blyth tells the newspaper.

– Sean Penn is not happy about Kate del Castillo's El Chapo documentary series on him, and he's not happy about it at all. The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story, which debuts on Netflix Friday, depicts Penn as having a fateful meeting with Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who was recaptured after a 2015 escape. Penn says he was only trying to tell the truth when he wrote about the meeting in Rolling Stone, and he's not happy about it either. "This is nothing but a cheap, National Enquirer-esque tale spun be a delusional person whose hunger for fame is both tawdry and transparent," a spokesperson for Penn tells Deadline. The spokesperson says Penn was never asked to make any changes to the series, and Penn himself didn't see it until a month ago. Sources tell Deadline that Penn's agent also tried to get the actor to see the series, but that Penn wanted it edited to make sure he was telling the truth. The sources say Penn is worried del Castillo and her associates will seek revenge on him.

Some of these other guys don't have crystal-clear reputations. That's how you're going to define this kid?" The comments were condemned by the NAACP, the NFL Players Association, and others. Parker went silent on Twitter after the controversy erupted, but he appeared to think he did nothing wrong, the Washington Post reports. He tweeted that critics were "uneducated" and "silly," and ESPN told him to stop tweeting. "I'm not a racist," he said on his show. "I'm just a guy who's trying to be a commentator."

– Israeli police have arrested a 19-year-old Jewish male in connection with a wave of bomb threats made against Jewish institutions in the US and around the world, the New York Times reports. According to CNN, the suspect is a dual American-Israeli citizen. He was arrested in southern Israel after an undercover FBI agent posing as a potential recruit placed a call to a Jewish community center in the city of Ashkelon. The caller claimed to have a bomb in the center and threatened to blow it up. The suspect was identified using "advanced camouflage technologies." The FBI and Israeli police had been investigating the threats for months. More than 100 threats were made against Jewish institutions in the US, Australia, and New Zealand this year. They were made against centers in 33 states. The threats were traced to overseas addresses. The FBI and Israeli police believe many of the threats were made by phone. The suspect's father was detained in connection with the investigation.

– A federal judge's ruling that the Obama health law is unconstitutional has landed like a stink bomb among Republicans, who've seen the politics of health care flip as Americans increasingly value the overhaul's core parts, including protections for pre-existing medical conditions and Medicaid for more low-income people. While the decision by the Republican-appointed judge in Texas was sweeping, it has little immediate practical impact because the Affordable Care Act remains in place while the legal battle continues, possibly to the Supreme Court, the AP reports. HealthCare.gov, the government's site for signing up, was taking applications Saturday, the deadline in most states for enrolling for coverage next year, and those benefits will take effect as scheduled Jan. 1. Medicaid expansion will proceed in Virginia, one of the latest states to accept that option. Employers will still be required to cover the young adult children of workers, and Medicare recipients will still get discounted prescription drugs. But Republicans, still stinging from their loss of the House in the midterm elections, are facing a fresh political quandary after US District Judge Reed O'Connor said the entire 2010 health law was invalid. Warnings about the Texas lawsuit were part of the political narrative behind Democrats' electoral gains. Health care was the top issue for about one-fourth

– Ireland's parliament has passed a bill that will allow abortions when the mother's life or health is in danger, the AP reports. The bill, which passed by a vote of 127 to 31, will allow abortions in cases of rape, incest, and when the mother's life is in danger from the fetus. The only exceptions are in cases of severe fetal abnormalities or when the mother's life is in danger from the fetus. The bill is expected to be signed into law by the country's Roman Catholic archbishop later today. The move comes after years of debate and protests in Ireland, where abortion was once illegal. The government says the bill will help women who are in danger of serious fetal abnormalities, but abortion rights advocates say the move will leave many women in limbo and could lead to legal challenges, the Guardian reports. Some 4,000 Irish women traveled to Britain for abortions last year, including 124 under 18.

He also urged the US to not "forget its differences" with other countries, reports the New York Times. "We must not forget our differences, but remember that they are brothers and sisters in need," he said. "We must not forget them, but we must not forget the human family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without, from the very beginning of our history." He also called for an end to gun violence, saying, "The arms trade today poisons the future of our world, and it is a source of terrorism, which kills, maiming, and maiming not only innocents but also many of our common good." He also urged the US to work together to fight climate change, saying, "We must not let the most serious effects of climate change be forgotten." He called for a "courageous and responsible effort" to fight the "environmental deterioration caused by human activity." He also urged Congress to pass a bill to protect the Statue of Liberty, reports the Washington Post.

– The Mediterranean diet has been linked to a long life, and now it appears that the diet itself may also help keep us younger. A study published in the British Medical Journal followed nearly 5,000 women over more than a decade, and researchers found that those who largely stuck to the diet had longer, healthier telomeres—the caps that protect the ends of our chromosomes, the BBC reports. Telomere length has been linked to a wide range of age-related diseases, including heart disease and cancer. "We found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with longer leukocyte telomere length," the study's lead author says in a press release. "This is the first study to show that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with longer leukocyte telomeres." The researchers say the findings highlight the importance of a well-rounded diet, which includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, poultry, fish, and olive oil. But they say the results don't prove that the diet is responsible for the longer lives. "All observational studies have the potential to produce misleading estimates, and we should not assume that the association with telomere length is necessarily causal," one expert says. "That said, this large well-conducted study is consistent with the hypothesis that dietary interventions may lead to substantial improvements

– A pregnant 22-year-old in El Salvador has had a successful cesarean section to deliver a baby that doctors say has little chance of surviving, reports AP. The woman, known only as Beatriz, suffers from lupus and kidney failure and had been denied an abortion despite the country's strict abortion laws. The Health Ministry stepped in last week after the ruling and said it would allow the C-section because the pregnancy was already at 26 weeks and the country's strict abortion laws were no longer at play. Beatriz's baby girl was born without a brain. "No one can say how long she will live," said a spokeswoman for the abortion rights group Colectivo Feminista. "It was painful to see the little creature. That's what the grandmother told us, and the doctors confirmed it." The operation followed a non-binding resolution by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that called on El Salvador to take action to save Beatriz's life after the country's courts had denied her an abortion. El Salvador's Supreme Court rejected Beatriz's request for an abortion on the grounds it breached the constitution, which it said protects life from the moment of conception. The International Court of Human Rights issued a non-binding ruling that

– Tens of thousands of supporters of Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi clashed with opposition protesters in Cairo yesterday, leaving at least one Muslim Brotherhood supporter dead and more than 120 injured in the worst violence since the country's Arab Spring began. The clashes began after Morsi's supporters tore down tents at the protest site, reports the Wall Street Journal. Morsi's opponents had gathered outside the presidential palace to protest a draft constitution that Morsi has decreed, giving him sweeping new powers. Tens of thousands of Morsi supporters then marched on the protest site, hurling rocks, firebombs, and swinging sticks. Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei tweeted that the "vicious attack" was "Regime leading Egypt into violence and bloodshed," reports the Los Angeles Times.

– A new study out of Sierra Leone suggests that 25% of people infected with Ebola don't show the typical symptoms, meaning they're not showing the illness's typical Deadly Symptoms (which include fever, unexplained bleeding, headache, muscle pain, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing problems, and difficulty swallowing) or at all. In other words, they're not showing the disease at all. The study, led by Gene Richardson of Stanford University, looked at 187 people in the village of Sukudu, which was hit hard by the Ebola outbreak. Of those, 14 had antibodies to Ebola, a sign they had been infected, and two recalled having a fever at the time of the outbreak, reports Gizmodo. But 12 said they didn't have any symptoms, and two recalled having a fever. Richardson says the asymptomatic people were "not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhea." It's unclear if they can pass it along sexually, and more research is needed to determine if Ebola can be spread sexually. The findings, published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, suggest that Ebola spread more rapidly and more broadly in the last outbreak, which killed more than 4,500 people in West Africa. "If Ebola can spread via asymptomatic people (that

– Congress wrapped up its two-year term today, with a flurry of major legislation to wrap up the year, including the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the New START nuclear arms pact. The lame-duck session was dominated by Democrats, who passed a huge economic stimulus, a massive health care overhaul, and new regulations on Wall Street trading and consumer credit cards, the Washington Post reports. "This has been a season of progress for the American people," President Obama said. "This has been the most productive post-election period we've had in decades, and it comes on the heels of the most productive two years that we've had in generations." The lame-duck session was also notable for the rise of the Tea Party, and the partisan divide that reached a fever pitch after the midterms. "This is the most dysfunctional political environment that I have ever seen," said one scholar. "But then you have to juxtapose that with [this Congress being] one of, at least, the three most productive Congresses" since 1900.

– Chris Christie got a rousing reception from the CPAC crowd today when he addressed the conservative conference—a welcome change from last year, when the event dinged him off the guest list, the Washington Post reports. The New Jersey governor, who was expected to speak, instead focused on the work of his fellow governors. "Republican governors in this country have stood up and done things, not just talked about them," he said. He praised the work of governors in Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan, and told the crowd that the GOP needs to do more to win elections and avoid nominating candidates that are too conservative. "We don’t get to govern if we don’t win," he said. "Let’s come out of this conference resolved to win elections again." He also used the speech to address the George Washington Bridge scandal, the Atlantic reports. "You know I’m shy and retiring, and I don’t like to speak my mind," he joked. He used the speech to remind conservatives of his anti-abortion stance, his record of taking on public-sector unions, and his record of governing in a blue state, the Post reports.

– Donald Trump met with dozens of black pastors on Monday, and the results were not pretty. Politico reports that the pastors—who were supposed to endorse Trump at a press conference—instead demanded an apology for his rhetoric toward racial minorities. "Our community really wants him to be sensitive with the way he handles people and they feel he's insensitive," says Bishop Orrin Pullings, who was one of the pastors in attendance. "We told him that you are insensitive in appearance to our community and that's not a good position. He listened to us and you know, I think Donald Trump is a very good listener." Trump says the meeting was "full of love" and that he didn't have to say anything because it was so "love." But Politico reports that some of the pastors did ask Trump to tone down his rhetoric, and that he refused to do so. "Another crowd said, 'No you should never apologize. You're ahead in the polls now because of your big mouth. You start apologizing, you've got to keep apologizing,'" says Pullings. Trump says the meeting went well and that he didn't have to say anything because the "tone has taken me to first position in every single poll." He also says

– A woman on a remote island in the Atlantic has given birth after breaking a ban on giving birth there. The woman, believed to be in her 20s, gave birth to a baby girl on Fernando de Noronha island, which has no maternity ward and is 230 miles from the city of Natal, reports the BBC. The woman says she was unaware of the pregnancy and is "dumbstruck." Expectant mothers are told to travel to the mainland, where the nearest big city is 227 miles away, reports the Guardian. Fernando de Noronha is famous for its wildlife reserve, which includes some of the world's best beaches.

– It's not a huge problem in the US, but it's causing major problems in Canada. The CBC reports on the "largest and most destructive invasive plant in the world," which it describes as "a fast-growing, extremely fast-growing, and extremely toxic plant." The so-called giant hogweed first appeared in North America in the late 1800s, and it's been there ever since, with some estimates putting it at more than a million plants. The CBC describes the plant as having "demonstrably the ability to out-compete native plants." It's been blamed for $150 million in damage in Canada alone, according to the CBC. The only way to get rid of the plant in Canada is to have people cut it down. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources says people can cut the plants down manually, but it's also possible to use chemicals. The Natural Resources Canada website has details on how to do that, including "root cutting," "cutting and mowing," and "cut and cover." The Natural Resources Canada website says people can also use trash to get rid of the plants. (A Canadian court recently ordered a Canadian company to stop selling a potentially dangerous drug.)

– A convicted killer who escaped from a Texas prison 16 years ago is back behind bars, but this time he won't be able to walk away with a new life. Juan Salaz, a 37-year-old American citizen, was captured in Mexico and is awaiting extradition to the US, where he is serving three 35-year sentences for attempted capital murder, the AP reports. He climbed over three 16-foot fences topped with razor wire to escape the Garza East prison in Beeville on March 22, 1997. He was seriously wounded in the escape and has been the only Texas prison fugitive to elude authorities since. "Salaz thought that he had eluded authorities by starting a new life in Mexico," says the state's prison inspector general. "He was wrong." The only other Texas prison fugitive is a 24-year-old convicted murderer who fled to Mexico in 2010.

– Tony Trapani, 81, was cleaning out his wife's filing cabinet after her death when he found a letter that had been hiding in there for more than 50 years. The letter, addressed to "Tony," was sent to him by the mother of Samuel Childress, who was then 5 years old. "He is five years old now. What I'm trying to say Tony is he is your son," the letter read. Childress, now 61, says his mother told him she sent the letter, but he assumed Trapani ignored it. Trapani now says his wife must have intercepted the letter and hid it in the cabinet, the New York Daily News reports. "Why my wife didn't tell me," Trapani says. "I don't know. She wanted children. She couldn't have any. She tried and tried." Childress says he grew up thinking his father didn't want to meet him. "Just to know him now is so important to me. It's going to fill that void," he tells WXYZ. The two finally met for the first time on Sunday. "He's my full son that I've had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me," Trapani

– Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Andreessen are in hot water over comments Andreessen made about India on Tuesday. The tech billionaire and Facebook board member was reacting to the country's ban on "Free Basics," a program that Facebook was trying to roll out to areas where Internet access was limited. "Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?" Andreessen tweeted, per Quartz. He added: "I am appalled by the actions of the Indian government and the decision to ban Free Basics. I am also appalled by the suggestion that Internet colonialism is OK." The Wall Street Journal reports that Zuckerberg quickly distanced himself from Andreessen's remarks. "I found the comments deeply upsetting, and they do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all," wrote Zuckerberg. "We strongly reject the sentiments expressed by Marc Andreessen last night regarding India." A Facebook rep also issued a statement: "We strongly believe that Internet.org is a good thing and we are committed to supporting access to the Internet for all. We strongly believe that Internet.org is a good thing for India." The Journal notes that India is one of the fastest-growing Internet markets in the world. (Google is also taking heat over India.)

– A woman who was obviously having a great time getting engaged posted a picture of her ring on Facebook, but her friends were more interested in what was in the bottom left corner of the picture: a pregnancy test. The woman, identified by the Daily Mail as Miranda Levy, asked why everyone was asking about the pregnancy test and, well, it turns out it was there. "Hey we're having a baby, too," she posted. The picture has since been deleted, but you can see it at BuzzFeed. (In other unfortunate Facebook gaffes, this man ended up having to take a nap after accidentally leaving his phone in the bathroom.)

– Ron Paul's declaration that "we are all Austrians now" has led to a lot of confusion, and one key piece of it is that he was talking about the Austrian school of economics, writes Matthew Yglesias at Slate. The term "Austrian economics" has a double meaning, he explains, because it refers to a very different philosophy from the mainstream economists Paul likes to champion. The Austrians believe that "stimulative" economic policies like low interest rates cause bubbles to form, and that the real problem with the current recession is that it's not caused by a bust, but by "malinvestment" in companies that crash when the stimulus is taken away. "This is an emotionally appealing idea, positing that the suffering of a bust is a kind of cosmic payback for the boom," Yglesias writes. "But it doesn’t make much logical sense." The Austrians also believe that cutting taxes to boost economic activity doesn't work, and that the Federal Reserve should have taken away the short-term interest rates it was using to stimulate the economy. They also don't like Milton Friedman's view that stimulus measures like the one President Obama used in 2009 actually helped. "It may seem 'obvious' that the decline

– President Obama's decision to fire the acting commissioner of the IRS and declassify the Benghazi emails has been hailed as a victory in the White House's PR war with Republicans. But is it enough? Here's what people are saying: The moves "have saved Obama from looking weak and out of touch," writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. But they're "not enough." Republicans are going to keep attacking the administration, and the White House will have to answer for all of it. "The president’s most important task now is to repair his image," writes the New York Times. "He can’t afford to be seen as weak in the face of a growing crisis." The IRS and Benghazi scandals are "tier one" issues, but the AP phone records seizure is a "tier two" issue, writes the Hill. The latter is a "matter of principle" because it involves the government's discrimination against conservatives. The White House has found its footing, says Politico. "Our goal since Monday night when the AP revelation poured accelerant on the fire has been to tackle each of the three issues separately but forcefully and get back on offense as soon as possible." The AP phone records seizure is a "second-tier

– Mexico's president has unveiled a plan to combat crime that includes giving state authorities control over municipal police and taking away the autonomy of local governments infiltrated by drug gangs, the Wall Street Journal reports. President Enrique Pena Nieto says the "historic" plan announced today is based on the "cruelty and barbarity" seen in the alleged massacre of 43 students in Iguala, but he says it is also based on the fact that "Mexico cannot go on like this." "After Iguala, Mexico must change," he says. The president's plan would also relax the division between federal, state, and local police, the AP reports. It would include a single, nationwide emergency telephone number, which the president says could be "911," as in the US. The plan will be formally presented next week.

– A rock-throwing teen was arrested Monday after allegedly savaging a Holocaust memorial in Boston, the second such attack in the city in two months, the Boston Globe reports. Police say the 17-year-old threw a rock through one of the glass panels at the New England Holocaust Memorial, which bears the numbers 666, which are tattooed on concentration camp victims. The teen was tackled by two bystanders and held until police arrived. He's been charged with willful destruction of property and police are investigating whether the incident was a hate crime. The memorial, which was installed in 1995, had never been vandalized before June. "It's a reminder that we as a community need to be united, both in our opposition to all forms of hate but also in the important role that memorials play in our community," Robert Trestan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, tells the Globe. "It's a second blow to the community, and it comes at a time when most of Boston is standing in solidarity [against] the hatred that we saw in Charlottesville over the weekend," he says. Mayor Martin Walsh tweeted: "Today and every day Boston stands up against hate. I'm saddened to see such a despicable action in this great city."

– Jonathan Pollard, the spy who's spent 30 years in prison for spying for Israel, will be released on parole Nov. 21, his lawyer announced Tuesday. The New York Times reports that a year after a federal panel denied the 60-year-old's request for parole, his lawyers worked furiously to get him a new hearing. They presented letters from prison officials that showed Pollard had behaved well and posed no threat to the country. Pollard's release, which CNN notes could help ease tensions between the US and Israel that have grown over the Iran nuclear deal, was announced by his lawyer, Eliot Lauer, and Jacques Semmelman, two lawyers who have worked pro bono for the past 15 years to free Pollard. "Mr. Pollard's status was determined by the United States Parole Commission according to standard procedures, and the Parole Commission's decision was in no way linked to foreign policy considerations," a National Security rep says. "Mr. Pollard will serve his sentence as mandated by statute for the very serious crimes he committed." The White House has said it won't challenge the parole decision, but it denied it was in any way connected to the Iran deal. (The US and Israel have been unable to agree on a replacement for Israel's missing nuclear arsenal.

– Scott Weiland's second wife is fighting for his estate, and it's all about his signature. Mary Forsberg, the ex-wife of the Stone Temple Pilots frontman who was married to him from 1994 to 2000, filed court documents on Dec. 30 asking to be named the executor of Weiland's will, People reports. She also filed a copy of the will, written in April 2007, with Weiland's signature as proof. The will was written when Forsberg and Weiland were in a marriage that fell apart, and when Weiland was struggling with drug use, TMZ reports. The Stone Temple Pilots frontman had about $2 million in assets as part of his estate, and also created a trust that has undisclosed assets. Weiland's widow, Jamie Wachtel, was with him for two years before his death on Dec. 3, and could still contest Forsberg's filing. A hearing has been set for Feb. 5. Forsberg is the mother of Weiland's two children, ages 13 and 15.

"We ask for privacy during this difficult process, and no further comments will be made from either one of us about this personal matter," the statement says. Anthony, 48, and de Lima, 28, started dating in 2012 and married in 2014, just months after their divorce from Jennifer Lopez, Us reports. Rumors of a split have been swirling since November, when Anthony appeared with Lopez at the Latin Grammy and they kissed on stage. A source told Us earlier this year that the marriage "just was not working and they didn't have enough in common." (Click to see a picture of Anthony and de Lima together.)

– The Senate has sent the House a stopgap spending bill that will keep the government running—but it doesn't fund ObamaCare. The bill passed easily yesterday, but conservatives are demanding that John Boehner reject it in order to avoid a government shutdown, reports the Hill. Boehner has promised a vote tomorrow, but the White House says it will veto any bill that doesn't fund the government—and Obama has already warned that a shutdown will be "unacceptable," reports the New York Times. "The American people are sick and tired of Washington obsessing over its power," he said. "They want to see government run, not business as usual." The House is expected to vote tomorrow on an amendment to the stopgap bill that would delay ObamaCare's individual mandate for one year and increase the national debt limit by some $778 billion. But the White House says it will veto any bill that doesn't fund the government. "The president has said from the beginning that he will not negotiate on the debt ceiling or on the government shutdown," a spokesman said. "We will not stand for a government shutdown."

– A video released this week shows a starving polar bear on its deathbed, its white hair limply covering its bony frame. The video was shot by nature photographer Paul Nicklen, a contributor to National Geographic, and co-founder of Sea Legacy, a nonprofit that uses storytelling and images to advocate for the environment. Nicklen was on a trip to a Canadian territory inside the Arctic Circle with Sea Legacy filmmakers when they came across the scene on Somerset Island, near the larger Baffin Island. "We stood there crying—filming with tears rolling down our cheeks," he tells National Geographic. The bear, which Nicklen says was on its deathbed looking for food in a garbage can, is one of the most gut-wrenching he's ever seen, and the video is intended to convey a larger message: Polar bears are facing increasing threats from climate change, which has already caused their summer months to be shorter and earlier, and which is expected to make their hunting grounds even worse as sea ice recedes. "When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like," Nicklen tells National Geographic. "This is what a starving bear looks like." But feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada, and Nicklen says he didn

– David Petraeus' affair with Jill Kelley may have gotten him in trouble with the feds, but not for leaking classified information. Federal prosecutors have recommended that he be charged for mishandling classified information, sources tell NBC News. The recommendation has been made to Attorney General Eric Holder, but he must decide whether the facts of the case warrant a court appearance. Investigators have concluded that the affair amounted to a "significant security breach," and they have recommended that Petraeus be charged with felony mishandling of classified information, the New York Times reports. Petraeus, who resigned as CIA director in November after admitting the affair, is expected to be indicted in the next few weeks.

– A Minnesota couple who say they're undecided about whether to have a baby has set up a poll on their blog that asks the question: "Should we give birth or have an abortion?" At the top of the page is a poll asking whether you want Alisha and Pete Arnold to abort the baby. The poll closes on Monday, and the Arnolds say they'll make their decision after the 20th week of Alisha's pregnancy, which will be her last chance to get an abortion. "It's kind of like Congress. They might vote for something, but the president has the final veto," Pete tells Gawker. "If it's overwhelming one way or the other, that will carry a lot more weight." The couple, both 30-year-old tech professionals, say they've been unsure about whether they're ready to be parents and decided to launch birthornot.com when Alisha got pregnant a third time. "It's definitely not a pro-life campaign," Alisha says. "I believe in a woman's right to choose."

– Sherri Papini has been reunited with her family after she was found alive on the side of a California highway early Thursday morning. Papini, who vanished after going for a jog on Nov. 2, was found around 4:30am on the side of Interstate 5 in Yolo County, the Sacramento Bee reports. Police say she was bound with restraints when she was let out of a SUV, but was able to flag down a passing vehicle. "Sherri is now safe," Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said at a press conference Thursday. "She's got her children, she's got her husband back, and she's doing very well." Police have not released details about Papini's condition or provided any information about her possible captors. "Sherri is a mother, and she's a nurse," her husband tells the Sacramento Bee. "She's a mother to two young children, and she's been through a lot." He says he plans to take his children to visit his wife on Thanksgiving. Papini's sister, Sheila Koester, tells the Bee that Papini and her husband have been reunited.

– Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan Monday to tighten gun laws, including expanding background checks and taking away the licenses of gun dealers who knowingly supply "straw purchasers," the New York Times reports. According to Vox, Clinton's plan would close the so-called "gun show loophole," which requires background checks for all sales at gun shows and online. But it would also close the so-called "gun show loophole" by expanding the definition of what it means to be "engaged in the business" of selling guns. Clinton's plan would require the ATF to issue new regulations to close the loophole. But the Times reports that the executive action Clinton is expected to announce Monday is likely to be opposed by the gun lobby. " executive action is a political strategy that will do nothing to reduce gun violence," the NRA says in a statement. "It is time to put an end to the failed gun lobby and put the people first." A Quinnipiac University poll released after the Oregon shooting found that only 24% of Americans support stricter gun laws, and only 23% of Republicans support them, the Times reports. According to Vox, Clinton's plan seems to be an attempt to contrast her stance with that of the GOP candidates, who have largely backed away from gun control. But gun control advocates

– The Canadian government has ordered the USS St. Roch to get rid of its famous cannons, which it says are a threat to national security, the Globe and Mail reports. The cannons, which were used in the Battle of Midway, were removed from the ship in 2012 and replaced with replicas. The St. Roch was the first ship to travel across the Northwest Passage and through the Panama Canal, and it's currently at the Great Maritime Museum in Vancouver. The cannons were removed after the museum's director said they were a threat to national security. "We have notified the Department of Defense, the US Navy, and our allies," says a government spokesman. "We have asked them to review the situation and if they find that it is a threat to US national security, we will take the necessary steps to remove the cannons." The museum's director says the cannons were removed because they were a threat to the ship's safety, and he wants the ship to stay open to the public. The St. Roch was commissioned in 1793 to help settle the British Columbia dispute with the indigenous Samiutl people. It sailed across the passage in 1711 and was destroyed in 1714 by a British Columbia earthquake. The Samiutl people eventually accepted the ship as their

– ISIS has released a new video that purports to show the execution of five men, including two British citizens, who it says were spying for the UK. The video, which has not been independently verified, features a man speaking with British accents before the apparent execution of the men, who are clad in jumpsuits, reports the BBC. At the end of the video, a young boy is seen pointing at the camera and speaking about killing "unbelievers." Authorities are trying to identify the masked man and confirm that he is British, reports the Guardian. The video comes less than two months after the death of the Jihadi John executioner, Mohammed Emwazi. The release of the video comes as ISIS loses ground in Iraq and Syria, and it's possible it's an attempt to distract viewers from that loss, a BBC correspondent says. The men in the video say they were recruited by ISIS to help with airstrikes on the group's leaders, but it's not clear whether they were actually recruited by the group. The men say they were shot in the back of the head in a desert, but the video appears to show them under duress, the BBC's correspondent says. A think tank head says it's "shocking" to see British voices

– A hole in the roof of a Southwest Airlines plane forced an emergency landing yesterday, but no one was seriously injured when the Boeing 737--300 plummeted 30,000 feet and caught fire. Passengers say they heard a loud explosion and saw the hole—which measured about 5 feet in length and appeared to have formed when the plane's fuselage ruptured—before pilots made a sudden descent, reports the Los Angeles Times. "The pilots said, 'We're going to need to make a rapid descent,'" one passenger tells the AP. "They said, 'There's a hole in the cabin,' and they said, 'It's going to be a lot of time.'" The airline has grounded 80 of its Boeing 737-300s so that they can be inspected, and says 300 flights have been canceled today.

– Michigan's attorney general filed criminal charges Friday against Gov. Rick Snyder and four other officials over the Flint water crisis, the Detroit Free Press reports. The charges—which include official misconduct, evidence tampering, and neglect of duty—are the first levied in a probe that's expected to broaden. "The state of Michigan has been hit with a public health emergency that has exposed state officials to risk of death from lead contamination in the drinking water of one of the most vulnerable populations in the nation," AG Bill Schuette said in a statement. "The actions of state employees have caused an extraordinary and ongoing public health crisis." The charges are related to the city's switch to the Flint River as its water supply, which led to elevated lead levels in the city's water system. The Free Press reports that the charges are tied to an investigation of the state's Department of Environmental Quality. The department was accused of not adequately protecting public health when it switched to the Flint River for its water supply in 2014. The AP reports that the charges are tied to an investigation of the department's handling of the crisis. The charges also include two current and former state employees, as well as the city of Flint and two emergency managers. The charges are related to the death of

– The Pentagon has made contingency plans to send special operations troops to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles if President Obama decides it's time to intervene, senior US officials tell the Los Angeles Times. The plan would likely involve airstrikes and stealthy raids to destroy the chemicals, and would involve special operations teams trained to handle them. Syria has said it will not use its chemical weapons, and a Syrian spokesman last month said they were stored and secured by the military. Analysts say it's unclear how much of the stockpiles Syria has, and whether the agents, including sarin and mustard gas, have weakened if the regime isn't regularly refilling them. "The actual killing may be less important than the panic they would induce," says one expert.

– The Iowa caucuses may have been a disaster for Newt Gingrich, but he's not exactly giving up on the Supreme Court ruling that opened the floodgates on corporate campaign cash. "I'm not the victim of that," he said yesterday. "I'm the victim of one particular person, Mitt Romney, whose staff went out and decided to run a deliberately negative and dishonest campaign." Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig, who wrote a book on the subject, told Democracy Now that he, too, supports the ruling. "I think it's a victory for free speech," he said. "But I think it's a victory for money, and I think it's a victory for money over people." The court's Citizens United decision, which opened the floodgates, "has nothing to do with the Citizens United case, it has to do with the floodgates for the unlimited campaign money that fueled them," Lessig said. "I think it's a victory for money over people." (See the full piece here.) Gingrich's comments come on the heels of other conservatives distancing themselves from the ruling, including Rick Perry, who said he was "appalled" by it, and Michele Bachmann, who said it "has destroyed the bedrock
