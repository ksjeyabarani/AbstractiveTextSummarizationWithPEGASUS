– Black Americans have the highest rates of hypertension in the world, and they're also more likely to suffer from heart failure, according to a study published in the American Journal of Cardiology. Researchers found that black people with high blood pressure ( hypertension) were 10 times more likely to suffer from heart failure than white people with the same blood pressure. They also had a 10-fold greater risk of dying from the disease, according to a press release. The study found that people with high blood pressure who had a genetic mutation were twice as likely to suffer from heart failure. Researchers believe the mutation is responsible for angiotensin II, a hormone that helps blood pressure rise. People with the mutation were also more likely to suffer from high blood pressure-related heart attacks and strokes, according to the study. The study found that people with the mutation were also more likely to have high blood pressure-related heart attacks and strokes if they had a genetic mutation known as homozygous for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta blockers. People with the mutation were also more likely to have high blood pressure-related heart attacks and strokes if they had a genetic mutation known as heterozygous for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs).

– A new study suggests that men who eat a lot of tomatoes have a lower risk of getting prostate cancer. Researchers found that men who ate a lot of tomatoes had a 9% lower risk of getting the disease than did men who ate a lot of other foods, reports the New York Times. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, didn't prove cause-and-effect, but it suggests that the antioxidants in tomatoes help fight off prostate cancer, reports the Los Angeles Times. The researchers say that men who ate a lot of tomatoes had higher levels of a carotenoid in their blood than did men who ate a lot of other foods, such as watermelon and pink grapefruit. The study's lead author, Dr. Supat Thammasitboon, tells the Times that men who ate a lot of tomatoes had higher levels of the carotenoid in their blood than did men who ate a lot of other foods. He says the findings should be taken with a grain of salt, but that men who ate a lot of tomatoes were less likely to have prostate cancer than men who ate a lot of other foods. (Men who ate a lot of onions were less likely to have prostate cancer.)

– A new study suggests that people who've had hepatitis C for a long time are more likely to die from the disease if they don't get better soon. Researchers looked at more than 1,200 people with chronic hepatitis C who had liver biopsies, and found that those who had persistently normal levels of a liver enzyme called alanine aminotransferase were more likely to die from the disease, the New York Times reports. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that those with normal levels of alanine aminotransferase were less likely to have advanced fibrosis, which is caused by fibrosis of the liver, than those with high levels of the enzyme. The study's lead author tells the Times that people with normal levels of alanine aminotransferase were thought to have a "mild" liver disease. "We were surprised to find that people with high levels of alanine aminotransferase were dying more often from hepatitis C," he says. "It's a striking finding." The study suggests that people with normal levels of alanine aminotransferase should be treated as soon as they're diagnosed with hepatitis C, according to a press release.

– If you're in need of a life-saving blood transfusion, you may want to think twice about donating. A new study finds that people who give blood are more likely to get HIV than those who don't, the New York Times reports. Researchers looked at the blood of more than 5,600 people in South Africa and found that those who gave blood had a 73% chance of getting the virus, compared to only 5% of those who didn't give. The risk was even higher for those who didn't give blood at all, according to the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. HIV is spread through contact with an infected person's blood or semen, or through sexual contact, according to the CDC. The study's lead author, Dr. Shinya Yamauchi, tells the Times that giving blood is a "relatively cheap" way to save lives, but it's important to be aware of the risks. "If you give blood, you are putting yourself at risk for infection," he says. "If you don't give blood, you are putting yourself at risk for infection."

– Scientists have figured out a way to use the power of the Internet to study the genomes of living organisms, the BBC reports. Essentially, researchers at the University of California at Berkeley used the power of the Internet to analyze the genomes of more than a million living organisms, looking for telltale patterns in the way proteins interact with each other. "It's like having a computer monitor watching what your neighbors are doing," says the lead researcher. "It's like you're watching a movie, but you're not actually in the movie." Instead of looking for specific sequences of proteins, the researchers looked for patterns in the protein's interactions with other proteins. They found that proteins in a given species interact with each other in a way that's similar to how proteins in another species interact with each other. "It's like having a computer monitor watching what your neighbors are doing," says the lead researcher. "It's like you're watching a movie, but you're not actually in the movie." The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, could help scientists better understand diseases, the BBC notes.

– When a 32-year-old man went to the doctor complaining of "frighteningness," "easy irritability," and "humiliating to self" for the past five years, he had no idea he'd been given the drug disulfiram, which is used to treat alcohol dependence. Instead, he was shocked to find that his psychosis had developed after he'd taken the drug twice a day for a month while abstaining from alcohol, Live Science reports. The drug blocks an enzyme that helps control the metabolism of dopamine, a central nervous system enzyme that helps control the release of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the brain's decision-making. Disulfiram can cause other side effects, including loss of memory, confusion, and mania. In a case study published in the British Medical Journal, doctors in India say the man's family history of schizophrenia and previous use of disulfiram should be considered when prescribing the drug. They found that the man's psychosis had developed after he'd taken 250mg of the drug twice a day for a month while abstaining from alcohol. The doctors say the patient's symptoms improved after he stopped taking the drug and took a tablet of lorazepam,

– If you live in Argentina, you may want to stock up on deltamethrin, the world's most widely used insecticide. The compound, which is also known as imidacloprid, has been linked to an increase in the number of bedbugs in the country's capital, Buenos Aires, as well as to an increase in the number of human cases of malaria, according to a study published in the journal Scientific Reports. The study's lead author, Dr. Miguel Bordier, says the compound has been used in the country for decades, but it's only recently been shown to be effective against bedbugs, which are believed to be responsible for an estimated 50% of the country's malaria cases, the BBC reports. Bordier and his team set out to discover just how effective deltamethrin is against bedbugs by breeding them in a lab, according to a press release. They found that bedbugs exposed to imidacloprid, which is applied directly to the bedbugs' exoskeletons rather than through the skin, survived for up to eight years after being exposed to the compound. "We were surprised by how long it took for the insects to adapt to this new chemical," the lead author says. "It's a huge step forward." bedbugs are

– If you break a bone in your spine or hip, you may want to skip the gym. A new study finds that women who break a bone in their upper lumbar region are more likely to have low bone mineral density and are also more likely to have osteoporosis, LiveScience reports. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at 206 postmenopausal Korean women ages 50 to 79 who had a distal radius fracture, a type of fracture that occurs when the bone doesn't fully heal after a fall. Researchers found that the women with the lowest bone mineral density were 30% more likely to have osteoporosis than the women with the highest bone mineral density. They also had a significantly higher rate of osteoporotic fractures, which occur when the bone doesn't fully heal, than the women with the highest bone mineral density. The study's lead author, Dr. Lee Min-joo, tells LiveScience that the osteoporosis found in the women with the lowest bone mineral density is similar to that found in the general population. He says that women who break a bone in their lower lumbar region may want to avoid physical activity for as long as possible. (Another recent study found that people who break a bone in their spine are more likely to have osteoporosis.)

– A new study suggests a possible link between a sugar found in red blood cells and the development of type 2 diabetes. Researchers at Kuwait's Sheikh Mohammed bin Fahd Medical University report in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine that mice injected with a form of srage, a splice variant of a cell receptor for advanced glycation end products, or rage, showed no sign of developing Type 2 diabetes. However, mice injected with a form of srage that binds to beta cells showed signs of developing the disease, reports the New York Times. "This is the first time that srage has been shown to be associated with the development of type 2 diabetes," the lead researcher says in a press release. "It's also the first time that srage has been shown to be protective against the development of diabetes." Mice injected with a form of srage that doesn't bind to beta cells showed no sign of developing the disease, but those injected with a form of srage that does bind to beta cells showed signs of developing the disease, reports the Times. The researchers say their study is the first to show a link between srage and the development of type 2 diabetes, which is caused by a lack of beta cells in the blood.

– If you've ever wanted to correct for your bad eyesight, cataract surgery may be the way to go. A new study published in the Journal of the American College of Ophthalmology finds that patients who had a new intraocular lens implanted in their eyes after cataract surgery were able to see well enough to read at the same distance they were able to see before the surgery. The study also found that the lenses, which are made of acrysof toriciol and alcon, corrected an average of 1.5 diopters of refractive astigmatism, or spherical astigmatism, over the course of a year. Prior to the development of the toric intraocular lens, which was approved by the FDA in 2005, the most common method of treating astigmatism after cataract surgery was to make an incision in the cornea, which is responsible for regulating the eye's brightness. The acrysof toric iol, however, "appears to be more stable and appear to be the preferred iol for correcting preexisting astigmatism in conjunction with cataract surgery," researchers write. The researchers looked at 18 patients who had the surgery between 2008 and 2012, all of whom were over the age of 70. They found that the patients who had the acrysof toric iols in their eyes

– When a 61-year-old Brazilian man came to a hospital complaining of a year of pain in his bladder, doctors decided to perform a radical cystectomy—a procedure that lasted just five hours, they report in the journal Bladder. The patient had small cell carcinoma of the bladder, a subtype of urothelial carcinoma that accounts for less than 1% of all bladder tumors, but which presents in the same way of other more frequent histological types, but with a high metastatic power. The patient's tumor was found to have metastasized, meaning it had spread to other parts of the bladder and to the lymph nodes of his children, reports Live Science. The patient died four months after the surgery, and doctors say that despite the aggressive nature of the tumor and the poor prognosis, they were able to successfully treat him with chemotherapy and radiation. "This is the first time in the world that we have successfully treated a patient with small cell carcinoma of the bladder, which presents in the same way as other more frequent histological types, but with a high metastatic power," one of the doctors says in a press release. "The diagnosis demands that the pathologist be suspicious and accurate in the analysis of the fragments of a transurethral bladder."

– A rare condition known as phakomatosis pigmentovascularis (ppv) has been described since 1947, but it's only now making headlines after a 13-year-old girl in Japan was found to have a wine stain covering her face, lower leg, and back, Live Science reports. According to a case study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the girl had no sex predilection, but was found to have a fifth type ofppv—cutis marmorata and mongolian blue spot—which has been added to the list of four main types described by the original Japanese researchers. In this case, the pigmentovascularis was found to be "widespread" and involved "the left side of face, chest engorged vein over lateral aspect of left leg along with hypertrophy of lower limb bluish discoloration of sclera of left eye color doppler picture showing anomalous draining vein on lateral aspect of left leg," the study states. A CT scan revealed focal parenchymal atrophy in the left parietal lobe region with foci of gyral calcification, according to the study. "This lesion was present on right side of the back as well as ... the left lower limb," the study states. "There was associated hypertrophy of

– It's a "smoking gun": A brain tumor called medulloblastoma is linked to a virus that lives in cows, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers found that brains from patients who died of medulloblastoma were strikingly similar to brains from patients who died of other types of brain cancer. They also found that brains from patients who died of medulloblastoma but didn't have the tumor were strikingly similar to brains from patients who died of other types of brain cancer. "This is the first time we've seen such a strong association between the two types of brain cancer," the study's lead author tells the New York Times. The researchers believe the virus, called brucella, lives in cows and causes a rare form of childhood brain cancer called neurobrucellosis. It's also found in humans, though it's not known whether the virus causes medulloblastoma. The lead researcher says it's too early to conclude that the virus causes medulloblastoma, but more research is needed to see if it's the cause.

– A common over-the-counter ointment can fight off some of the world's most drug-resistant bacteria, according to a new study. Scientists tested bensal hp, a combination of salicylic acid, benzoic acid, and polyethylene glycol, on 184 bacterial and fungal isolates from around the world and found it was able to fight off vancomycin-resistant enterococcus aureus, gram-negative so-called "superbugs," as well as enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, LiveScience reports. "This is the first time that topical agents have been shown to be effective against a broad range of organisms that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics," the study's lead author says in a press release. Bensal hp was also able to fight off yeasts and fungi, according to the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. But it's not just bacteria that bensal hp was able to fight: It was also able to fight off MRSA, a particularly dangerous antibiotic-resistant form of staphylococcus aureus, according to the study. Researchers say bensal hp could be an important tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance because it's a common over-the-counter ointment that can

– It's a hip surgery that's been around for a while, but a new study in the British Medical Journal raises the possibility that it could be a life-saving procedure for some of the world's most elite athletes. The researchers looked at 45 professional athletes who suffered from what's known as femoral labral impingement, or fai, and found that those who'd had the surgery were able to return to their sport within six weeks, reports the New York Times. "This is the first time that we've seen evidence that fai can be successfully treated with a simple, low-risk surgery," the lead researcher says in a press release. The surgery involves removing bone and cartilage from the femoral neck—the part of the hip that's not aligned with the femur—to expose the inside of the hip joint. The Times notes that the condition has been linked to hip pain in young athletes for decades, and the researchers say it's time to start treating the problem with surgery instead of conservative measures such as massages and physical therapy.

– A new study has found that one in five kids under the age of 5 in Iran is malnourished—and that's a huge problem, LiveScience reports. In the study published in the journal Pediatrics, researchers looked at 902 children in southern Iran and found that 35.8% were underweight, 42.7% were stunted, 9.2% were wasted, and 7.5% were either overweight or obese. (The latter category includes kids who are either obese or have a body mass index of 30 or higher.) "We were surprised by the prevalence of underweight, stunting, wasting, overweight, and obesity in children under 5 years old in this region," the lead researcher says in a press release. "We were also surprised by the high prevalence of obesity in this age group." The researchers say that kids who are either obese or have a body mass index of 30 or higher are more likely to be malnourished, and that children who are either overweight or have a body mass index of 30 or higher are more likely to die from malnutrition. The lead researcher says that in Iran, the government needs to do more to fight malnutrition, the AP reports.

– A rare genetic disorder has left a 5-year-old Italian boy with a shaved head, Live Science reports. The boy was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1, or nf-1, which is an "extra calvarial nerve sheath" disorder affecting just one in 2,500 people. The condition causes nerve cells to proliferate and proliferate quickly in and around the boy's brain and spinal cord, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The boy had no neurological deficits or family history of the disorder. Doctors removed the boy's brain and spinal cord and stitched him back up. The condition is so rare—only one case in 36,00080,000 people—that it's called "the rarest genetic disorder in the world," according to the New England Journal of Medicine. The boy's parents were surprised to find out their son had the disorder. "I didn't expect it in my son," the boy's mother tells Live Science. "I didn't expect it in a 5-year-old boy." Doctors believe the disorder is caused by mutations in the nf-1 gene. The boy's condition is so rare that only nine other cases have been found in humans, according to the New England Journal of Medicine.

– When a 59-year-old woman went to the doctor with a black, swollen skin lesion in her right breast, doctors weren't sure what to make of it. But after an incisional biopsy, they found a malignant melanoma that had metastasized, meaning it had spread to other parts of the breast, reports Live Science. The woman is now cancer-free three years after the surgery, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal. It's rare for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the breast, though it does happen in other parts of the body, including the brain, liver, lung, and spine. In this case, the tumor was located in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast, "in comparison to primary cutaneous malignant melanomas arising from other areas," according to the study. The woman had been exposed to the sun for her entire life, but the tumor was not associated with any breast mass. After the skin lesion was found, doctors removed normal skin and subcutaneous tissue to make sure there was no spread of the tumor, as well as the lymph node, which was not palpated, according to the study. The woman was given the cancer treatment known as an immunotherapy, in which the patient's immune system

– Scientists are reporting in the journal Nature Communications that they've successfully manipulated radiation to alter the human genome in a way that could one day help people with cancer. Reporting in the journal Scientific Reports, they say that by altering the DNA of keratinocytes, cells in the skin that produce hair, they were able to alter the human genome in a way that caused the cells to produce more of a protein called cy5 instead of the normal protein. The process, which involved exposing keratinocytes to high doses of radiation and then re-injecting the cells back into the body, allowed the cells to differentiate into different types of cells, reports the New York Times. The hope is that by altering the genome in such a way, it could one day be possible to treat people with cancer, reports the Times. The researchers say that in mice, they were able to mimic the effects of the radiation in the same way in humans, and that more research is needed to confirm their findings.

– There's a new way to diagnose a painful joint infection, and it doesn't require a trip to the doctor. Instead, doctors can use synovial fluid, which is found in the joint where the bone and cartilage meet, to detect the presence of periprosthetic joint infection, or pji, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Previously, pji was diagnosed by measuring inflammatory factors such as white blood cell levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum c-reactive protein, which is found in blood, per a press release. However, the American Academy of orthopedic surgeons updated its definition of pji in 2012 to include synovial fluid instead of serum, which is more sensitive and easier to interpret, according to the release. Researchers looked at nine studies on the use of synovial fluid to diagnose pji and found it to be most accurate when used alongside serum c-reactive protein. They also found it was most accurate when used alongside synovial fluid's other biomarkers, which include interleukin (IL)-6, interferon- il-17a, tumor necrosis factor-ll-37, and cathelicidin ll-37. The study's lead author, Dr. Supat Thammasitboon, tells the

– A young woman received a course of chemotherapy for leukemia, then developed a nasty infection that perforated the cornea of her right eye. It's the first known case of such an infection in an acute-leukemia patient, researchers report in the British Medical Journal. The 17-year-old had swelling and pain in the upper lid of her right eye for two days after the treatment, but no other abnormalities were found. On the 12th day, she suffered a "spontaneous bloody and purulent discharge from the upper palpebral conjunctiva," the researchers write. The infection was caused by a bacteria called staphylococcus aureus, which is known to cause infections in the cornea and other parts of the eye. It's possible that the bacteria invaded the cornea directly, causing it to melt and perforation, or that the bacteria got in through the cornea's protective covering, the conjunctiva, reports Live Science. Either way, researchers say it's important to watch out for such infections in immunocompromised patients.

– If you've ever wanted a natural-looking tooth that looks and feels just like yours, you're in luck: Scientists say they've figured out how to make a composite restoration look and feel just like yours, without damaging the tooth, the New York Times reports. The trick, according to a study published in Scientific Reports, is to add a solvent to the bonding agent used to create a thin layer of protection between the tooth and dentin, the material that holds the tooth's structures in place. The problem is that too much of one of the solvents (e.g., acetone) can hurt the bonding agent's ability to polymerize and reduce the amount of water that exits the collagenous network that helps bind the monomers used to make the composite, Scientific American reports. To test this, researchers etched teeth into 3D shapes using 35% phosphoric acid gel and then added either 10%, 30%, 39%, or 50% ethanol to the bonding agent to create a hybrid layer. The results showed that the hybrid layer held the teeth better when the ethanol concentration was higher than 10%, but less than 30%, and more than 50% when it was lower. The study's lead author, Dr. Stevenholmes, tells the Times that the results

– Scientists have cloned a human gene that may play a key role in the development of autoimmune diseases, the BBC reports. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign cloned a copy of the hnrnp b2 gene from human embryos and found that it appears to play a role in the production of T-cells, which attack invading viruses. "It's the first time that a gene for T-cells is known to be involved in the development of human autoimmune diseases," the lead researcher says in a press release. "It's also the first time that a gene for T-cells is known to be involved in the development of autoimmune diseases." The discovery could lead to better treatment for diseases such as celiac disease and multiple sclerosis.

– A new class of antibiotics could be on its way to treating some of the world's most drug-resistant diseases, according to researchers at the University of Washington. In a study published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers say they've isolated the first gene in the world that confers resistance to a class of antibiotics called macrolides, which include azithromycin and clarithromycin, as well as streptogramin b and lincosamides, reports the Washington Post. "This is a really big deal because it's the first time that a gene has been identified that confers resistance to all three of these classes of antibiotics," the lead researcher says in a press release. "It's a really big deal because it's going to open the door to a whole new class of drugs that are resistant to a lot of these drugs." Researchers believe the bacteria behind the resistance—called vga(a)lc—are able to produce their own versions of the drugs, which are more potent and last longer than the ones they were originally designed to treat, the BBC reports. Researchers say they hope to use the discovery of vga(a)lc to develop a new class of antibiotics, called quinolones, that can fight off

– A 51-year-old leukemia patient is dead after contracting a rare, antibiotic-resistant fungal infection, Live Science reports. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the man had been given chemotherapy for his acute myeloid leukemia, but it didn't produce any remissions. Instead, he developed a skin infection and a blood infection called pseudozyma aphidis fungaemia. The skin infection was caused by the yeast strain pseudozyma aphidis, and the blood infection was caused by the yeast strain vancresistant enterococcus faecium, Live Science reports. The leukemia had metastasized, meaning it had spread to other parts of the body. According to the study, it's the first time pseudozyma aphidis fungaemia has been found in a human. The leukemia patient was given the antibiotics ceftazid and isepamicin, as well as the anti-fungal fluconazole, but it wasn't enough to prevent the infection. Researchers believe the man contracted the infection while taking part in a clinical trial using the anti-fungal caspofungin. The study states the man's death should serve as a warning to other leukemia patients.

– If you're diabetic and have end-stage renal disease, you may have a higher risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers, which can lead to amputations and even death, according to a new study out of the Middle East. Researchers at Hamad General Hospital in Qatar looked at more than 5,600 hemodialysis patients who were at least three months into their treatment when the study began in 2007, reports the New York Times. They found that those with the ulcers were 10 times more likely to die during the five-year study, and those with the ulcers were twice as likely to have a major amputation, according to a press release. The ulcers are caused by a buildup of plaque in the feet, which can lead to blood clots and other problems. The researchers believe the ulcers are caused by a combination of physiological, mechanical, and treatment factors. The study's lead author, Dr. Nasser al-Attiya, tells the Times that the findings suggest that people with end-stage renal disease should be screened for the ulcers before undergoing dialysis. "It's a public health emergency," he says. (Another recent study found that people with Type 2 diabetes are more likely to die from heart disease.)

– A heart-wrenching story out of China, where a single gene mutation has been linked to a lethal form of cardiomyopathy—and now researchers say they've found a way to prevent it from happening in the first place. Reporting in the journal Scientific Reports, they say they sequenced the scn5a gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the major sodium channel in the heart, and found that a1180v—a single nucleotide mutation in 20 of the gene's exons—causes a reduction in sodium and an increase in late sodium current that can lead to cardiomyopathy, which is the most common form of primary cardiomyopathy and is the leading cause of heart transplants. The mutation was found in a three-generation Chinese family with cardiomyopathy, and in six younger members of the family who weren't carrying the mutation. The researchers then followed up all three generations of the family for six years, and found that all but six were carriers of a1180v, which they say "is a functional mutation that can contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy." They also found that the gene mutation was present in a small number of Asian people, and that it's "inconsistent with our previous observations" that a1180v is "virtually absent" in other

– When a 70-year-old man showed up at a UK hospital complaining of blurry vision for six weeks, he was initially thought to have suffered from macular degeneration, which is the leading cause of blindness in the US. But a scan revealed the man had an entirely different problem: He had a "pseudophakic inferotemporal macula" detachment, which was causing him to lose the part of the eye that compensates for nearsightedness and farsightedness, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology. The study's lead author tells the BBC that such detachments are "very rare" and that it's important to diagnose them as early as possible. In this case, doctors were able to repair the detachment in just five days using a new technique called spectral domain optical coherence tomography, which uses light waves to map out the microscopic structure of the eye. In a press release, the researchers explain that the new technique has allowed doctors to "detect the morphological changes seen in retinal detachment with the presence of intraretinal cysts, undulation of outer retinal layers, and the hyper reflective in the photoreceptor layer." They say the surgery to remove the detachment was performed within 24 hours of the patient's arrival at the hospital and that vision had returned to normal

– The human eye lens is made up of approximately 35% of its soluble mass in proteins called crystallins, which are found almost exclusively in the lens itself and are composed of a 3:1 ratio of a to b. Almost exclusively in the lens, b has been found throughout the body, including the heart, muscle, kidney, lung, and skin cells. Now researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they've discovered a third subgroup of crystallins, b-crystallins, which are also found throughout the human body and are responsible for the lens's transparency and structure. When crystallins aren't interacting with each other properly, they become water-soluble and begin to accumulate, which can lead to changes in the lens' structure and, in the case of cataracts, damage to the lens' organelles, reports Popular Science. The researchers found that by altering the crystallins' activity, they were able to prevent lens cells from ejecting their organelles, which in turn prevents normal protein turnover, which can lead to damage and, in the case of cataracts, cataract formation. They also found that by altering the crystallins' activity, they were able to create a modified egg-white protein, lysozyme, which was

– Women who are obese are more likely to suffer organ damage from high blood pressure, according to a new study out of South Korea. Researchers found that obese women who had high blood pressure during the day were twice as likely to have damage to the heart, liver, and other organs as women who had normal blood pressure during the night, NBC News reports. The study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, also found that the more fat a woman has, the more likely she is to have high blood pressure. "Obesity is a worldwide phenomenon, with an incidence increasing in parallel with obesity—associated diseases such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension," the study's lead author says in a press release. "Although body mass index is associated with the severity of ambulatory hypertension and an increase in daytime blood pressure, bmi does not reflect body fat," he adds. "epicardial adipose tissue is related to fat than total adiposity, rather than visceral fat, and shares microcirculation with myocardial tissue and coronary vessels." The study looked at more than 4,000 South Korean women over the age of 50 who had been diagnosed with essential hypertension. Researchers found that the more fat a woman has, the more likely she is to have high blood pressure

– Someday, you may be able to buy a 3D-printed tooth that looks a lot like your own. Or at least that's what a new study suggests. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh say they've figured out how to make a 3D-printed tooth that looks a lot like a real tooth, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. The scientists used a process known as additive manufacturing, which involves using 3D technology to create a 3D image of a material. The image is then uploaded to a computer, where it's printed onto an actual tooth, according to a press release. "It's like having a picture of your own tooth," says study co-author Joshua Bornemann. "You don't have to go to the dentist to get a picture of your own tooth." That's because the patient doesn't have to touch the actual tooth to get a picture of it, the Post-Gazette notes. Plus, the technology doesn't require the patient to have any dental work done first, according to the study, published in the Journal of Periodontology. And it doesn't require the patient to have any decayed teeth before the work can be done. The researchers say the technology could be used to create missing teeth

– When a 19-year-old woman went to the doctor, she had curly, wavy hair on her head—and it wasn't because she had lice. It was because she had trichonodosis, a rare condition in which hair gets caught in combs and brushes and breaks away, Live Science reports. "This may be spontaneous or secondary to mechanical factors like vigorous scratching or combing the hair," the doctors wrote in a case study published in the British Medical Journal. The woman, who had hair up to the nape of her neck and long, dry hair on the scalp, had no history of lice or excessive hair-care use, the doctors say. The condition is caused by "scratching, combing, washing, or friction," according to the doctors' report. "If the knots are pulled excessively tight, transverse splintering of the hair shaft and simulation of trichorrhexis nodosa may result," the doctors write. The woman's condition is so rare that doctors have only seen it once before in their lifetimes, in a case involving a woman who had lice on her head as a child. (In other hair-related news, this woman's head of hair finally grew back.)

– A potentially deadly drug used to treat multiple sclerosis may actually be doing more harm than good, according to a new study out of Germany. The drug, mitoxantrone, was approved by the FDA in 2003 for the treatment of worsening multiple sclerosis, but it has been linked to heart attacks and strokes in some patients. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers looked at 30 MS patients who received infusions of mitoxantrone every three months for three years. They found that those who received low doses of the drug had fewer heart attacks and strokes than those who received high doses. But those who received 140mg of mitoxantrone every three months had more heart attacks and strokes than those who received the maximum dose of 156mg, according to a press release. It's not clear what's causing the side effects of mitoxantrone, which has been linked to an increase in the risk of heart attacks and strokes in some patients, but researchers say it's possible that the drug keeps the immune system from attacking the brain's neurons that are key to the body's fight against the disease. It's also possible that the drug keeps the immune system from attacking the heart's blood vessels, which can lead to heart

– Scientists say they've discovered a new way to treat Alzheimer's disease, one that doesn't involve cutting off the body's supply of a particular drug. Instead, researchers say they've figured out a way to alter a gene in the brain that makes a protein known as pr2a turn on or off, reports the New York Times. The discovery is a big deal because it's the first time a gene mutation has been linked to a neurodegenerative disease. "It's a completely new way of looking at neurodegenerative diseases," the lead researcher from the University of California, San Francisco, tells the Guardian. "It's a completely new way of looking at cancer." pr2a turns on or off the threonine protein, which makes the brain's T-cells turn on and off, explains the Times. When it's turned on or off, the T-cells don't make enough threonine to keep them alive. Researchers found that by altering the threonine protein, they were able to turn it on and off without causing side effects in mice. The next step is to see if the alteration can be reversed with a simple pill, or if it can be used in combination with other drugs to treat

– People who suffer from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) might want to stock up on vitamin d. A new study out of Iran suggests that taking vitamin d—a fat-soluble vitamin found in a number of foods, including oils and dairy products—could help ease the progression of the disease, which is associated with an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease, Live Science reports. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at 60 patients with nafld who were split into two groups. The first group took vitamin d pills every week for 10 weeks, while the second group took a placebo. At the end of the study, there were no significant differences in liver function between the two groups, according to a press release. "Our findings suggest that vitamin d may play a key role in the treatment of NAFLD by reducing inflammation," the study's lead author says in the press release. Vitamin d is known to help regulate calcium and phosphorus metabolism, but it's also known to play a role in the development and regulation of inflammation, according to Live Science. Previous studies have shown a link between vitamin d and liver disease, but there's been no evidence of a link between vitamin d levels and NAFD. The new

– Men who suffer from benign prostatic hyperplasia, an enlarged prostate that can lead to urinary problems, erectile dysfunction, and even cancer, may be able to have the organ removed without having to undergo a risky surgery, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Men who undergo the standard transurethral resection of the prostate, or turp, are at much higher risk of death than men who undergo the less common keyhole surgery, but researchers say the keyhole procedure is easier to learn and more effective than turp, which takes around 50 to 100 patients to master, the New York Times reports. "The learning curve for turp ... ranges from 50 to 100 cases and this level of experience is often not reached by residency training period because of the dramatic decrease in the overall turps being performed annually," the study's lead author says in a press release. The keyhole surgery uses a laser to slice out the prostate tissue, and researchers say it's safer than turp for both patients and doctors. They performed the surgery on 532 men over a 10-year period, and found that those who had the keyhole procedure lived longer on average than those who had turp, LiveScience reports.

– When a 66-year-old man came to the hospital complaining of shortness of breath and abdominal pain in 2012, he was diagnosed with dyspnea—a common symptom of myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow disorder. But when his chest CT scan didn't find any abnormalities, doctors decided to take a closer look at the man's lungs. What they found: an extramedullary hematopoiesis, an abnormal buildup of white blood cells in the lungs that can lead to hypertension, reports LiveScience. The condition can occur after liver and bone marrow transplants, chemotherapy, or other treatments for myelofibrosis, and it's been linked to an increased risk of heart attack and lung infection in patients with the disorder, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In this case, the extramedullary hematopoiesis was found to have been present in the man's liver, spleen, and pleura, and the white blood cells were found to have been elevated with a low hemoglobin level. The man, who had been hospitalized multiple times for dyspnea over the past two years, was treated with a steroid injection and hydroxyurea, which is a blood thinner, to reduce the amount of white blood

– Scientists have discovered a potential new way to fight cancer, and it's all thanks to a chemical found in coffee. The BBC reports on the discovery of etoposide, a compound that binds to a protein called rnf8, which is found in mitotic cells. When rnf8 is activated, it causes cells to bind to a protein called ubiquitin, which is found in pretty much every cell. But when ubiquitin is turned off, the rnf8 protein doesn't bind to ubiquitin, and the cells begin to die. Researchers found that when etoposide was added to coffee, rnf8 and ubiquitin didn't bind to each other, and the cells stopped dying. They published their findings Wednesday in Nature Communications. "This is the first time that ubiquitin is turned off in a manner that prevents mitotic cells from dying," the study's lead author, Dr. Orthwein, says in a press release. "It's also the first time that ubiquitin has been turned off in a manner that prevents mitotic cells from dying." If the compound is approved by the FDA, it would be the first treatment for cancer caused by rnf8, according

– It's one of the most common cancers of the mouth, but doctors in Spain say they've never seen a case like it. A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with oral malignant melanoma after complaining of pain and swelling in his upper right gums, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal. A CT scan revealed the tumor, which had spread from the gingiva to the hard palate, but doctors couldn't tell where it was located, reports the New York Daily News. They opted to remove the tumor using a titanium mesh graft that was placed in the man's mouth. "This is the first time we've seen a case of oral malignant melanoma that was not accompanied by any other symptoms," the study's lead author says in a press release. The man, who had no family history of the disease, is now cancer-free, but doctors warn that it's important to be aware of oral melanoma because it is extremely rare and can spread to other parts of the body.

– Cat owners may soon be able to skip the shots that blind their beloved felines: Scientists say they've found a way to restore vision to cats suffering from degenerative eye disease, Phys.org reports. In a study published in the journal Cell Reports, researchers say they've genetically modified a cat's own stem cells to produce retinal cells that are then transplanted back into the cat's eye. The cells are able to produce new photoreceptor cells that keep the eye healthy, according to a press release. It's not clear how long the procedure would take, but researchers say it could be years before a treatment can be developed for cats suffering from macular degeneration, which is the leading cause of blindness in felines and is caused by a buildup of plaque in the eye's retina, Popular Science reports. The lead researcher says it's possible the procedure could be used to treat humans with the same disease.

– When a 71-year-old man went to the hospital with "dilative cardiomiopathy" and elevated red blood cells, doctors thought he had liver disease. But when an ultrasound revealed a cyst about the size of a grain of sand in his bile ducts, they were more than a little surprised. The cyst was actually a rare congenital malformation of the biliary duct known as a von mayenburg complex, or vmcs, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study's lead author tells the Washington Post that vmcs can be caused by any number of things, but the most common one is a congenital heart defect. "It's a very rare condition, but it's very common," he says. The patient in this case had no family history of the condition and no history of liver disease. When doctors performed a follow-up ultrasound, they discovered the cyst. "It was very unusual," the lead author tells the Post. "It was very small, very hypoechoic, and had comet- tail echoes." The patient is now recovering.

– In Brazil, same-sex marriage is illegal and punishable by up to 14 years in prison. But the country's president recently signed a bill into law that will allow same-sex marriages to take place in the privacy of their own homes, the New York Times reports. It's not the first time same-sex marriage has been legal in Brazil; in fact, President Dilma Rousseff signed a bill in 2011 that made same-sex marriage legal in all of the country's states. But Rousseff signed the bill into law before the World Health Organization had even finished its report on the country's HIV epidemic, which found that more than 388,000 Brazilians were newly infected with the virus in 2012, up from 250,000 in 2005—and that 10% of all new infections occurred in areas where same-sex marriage was legal before the bill was signed. The report found that men who have sex with men are more likely than the general population to be living with alcohol and drug abuse, and that people with HIV are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. But Rousseff's bill will allow same-sex marriages to take place in the privacy of their own homes, and the Times notes that the

– If you're over the age of 65 and living in a nursing home, you may want to steer clear of beer. That's according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine that looked at nursing homes across the US and found that nearly half of the patients admitted there did not receive proper treatment for alcohol abuse, reports the New York Times. The study also found that more than half of the patients were prescribed drugs for which there was no evidence of adverse effects, including anti-depressants, antibiotics, and painkillers. The study's lead author, Dr. Nancy Avis, tells the Times that the problem is that most nursing homes don't follow guidelines for proper treatment of alcohol abuse, which include asking patients if they've had more than one glass of wine in the past month, and making sure residents are aware of alcohol-related side effects. The study also found that almost half of the patients who did receive treatment for alcohol were prescribed drugs for which there was no evidence of adverse effects, including anti-nausea drugs, anti-psychotics, and anti-epileptics. The study's findings are likely to lead to changes in how nursing homes approach alcohol abuse, the Times notes.

– A 4-year-old girl in India is recovering after a rare condition left her with a large, painful spleen that doctors were able to remove with a simple procedure. The child had extrahepatic portal venous obstruction, or ehpvo, a condition in which the extrahepatic portal vein—which carries blood from the spleen to the stomach and back—is replaced by a cavernoma, the New York Times reports. The cavernomas are common in developing countries and the condition is the most common cause of bleeding in children, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Doctors were able to remove the ehpvo-filled portal vein with an under-the-eye procedure called an endoscopic therapy that uses a tiny camera to peer inside the child's body. "It's a very simple procedure and it saved the child's life," the lead author of the study tells the Times. "It's a big difference in treatment in the developed world and in the developing world." The condition is often treated with surgery, but it can also lead to brain damage and death, according to a press release.

– When a 50-year-old man in New York City went to the hospital complaining of a fast heartbeat, doctors thought they'd found the source of the problem: his heart. But when they opened the man's mitral valve, they found it was completely blocked, the New York Daily News reports. "This is the first time we've ever seen a blockage of the mitral valve," the lead author of a case study published in the New England Journal of Medicine says in a press release. The man had been diagnosed with arheumatic heart disease, which causes narrowing of the mitral valve. echocardiography showed no sign of calcium buildup in the annulus, the part of the mitral valve that allows blood to flow to the left side of the heart. Doctors decided to open the man's mitral valve using two balloons 20 and 18 inches in diameter, the New York Times reports. They secured the balloons in the left ventricular apex with a double coil and inflated them, but when they opened the man's mitral valve, they found it was completely blocked. Doctors say the man's condition had worsened to the point that he was in a coma for three days after the procedure, but he regained consciousness and was able to walk, talk, and eat on his own.

– If you're a woman in the United Arab Emirates, your chances of developing metabolic syndrome are higher than those of a man, according to a new study. The condition, which doubles the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is characterized by elevated levels of fat in the body, particularly around the abdomen, according to a press release. The study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, looked at 29 healthy men and women between the ages of 29 and 61 and found that the risk of developing the condition was 15% higher for women and 18% higher for men in the country, which is ranked by the World Health Organization as one of the highest in the world for prevalence of the condition. The researchers believe the higher risk is due to "gender differences in fat accumulation and/or the secretory function of adipose tissue," according to the press release. The men and women were also tested for muscular strength and aerobic fitness, according to the study. The study found that the more fit the participants were, the less likely they were to develop metabolic syndrome.

– If you're a doctor who can't write prescriptions, a new study suggests you might want to consider teaching yourself. Researchers at Indiana University Bloomington asked medical students to write prescriptions for actual patients, then compared their scores to those of a control group who were taught about five clinical conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, asthma, andpeptic ulcer, Medical News Today reports. The control group scored higher on average than the students who wrote the prescriptions themselves, but the students who were taught patient-based teaching scored higher on average than the students who wrote the prescriptions themselves, according to a post at Eureka Alert. The researchers say the practice could help improve the prescribing skills of medical students, who are still expected to write prescriptions even after graduation.

– Eight people who contracted tuberculosis while high on marijuana in Washington state have died, bringing the total number of people who have died from the disease in the state in the last eight years to 27. Of those, seven had the drug-resistant strain of TB, NBC News reports. The patients ranged in age from 18 to 46 and were born in Africa, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. All had traveled to the US in the last decade, and all had been diagnosed with TB by the time they died. The outbreak was traced to a small cluster of drug users in Seattle's Beacon Hill neighborhood, according to a press release. After the first case was diagnosed in 2003, health officials traced the group to a number of locations, including cars and one of the patients' apartments, where they smoked marijuana and "hotboxed"—inhaing the smoke repeatedly in a vehicle with the windows closed, according to the study. Many of the people in the network were friends of the patients, and they were more likely to have TB than other people in the group, according to the study. The cluster of cases was one of the biggest TB outbreaks in the US in the last decade, according to the New York Times, and public health officials are now

– A particularly dangerous superbug is emerging in Malaysia, and researchers say they've identified it for the first time in the country.methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or mrsa, is resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin, which is used to treat 80% of infections in the country, reports the New York Times. Hvisa, as it's called, has developed a resistance to vancomycin that makes it harder for doctors to treat infections. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers isolated mrsa strains in 320 patients at the largest hospital in Malaysia and found that seven of them were Hvisa, a rate of 2.19%. "This is the first time we have seen Hvisa in Malaysia," the lead researcher says in a press release. "It is concerning because it means that doctors in this country may not be able to treat infections that are now resistant to vancomycin, which is the standard first line treatment for mrsa." The researchers say the Hvisa strain is particularly dangerous to people with weak immune systems, including children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.

– A 70-year-old woman who had been taking a drug used to treat Type 2 diabetes ended up dying of a rare lung disease—and doctors say it's not clear why. The woman had been taking the drugvildagliptin, which is taken twice daily, since 2010 when she developed kidney failure and needed to undergo dialysis for end-stage renal disease, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. After she stopped taking the drug, however, she developed multiple lesions on her lung that turned out to be non-tuberculosis-related, the study says. After an anti-tuberculosis drug and the drugvildagliptin were given, the lesions increased in size and turned out to be non-tuberculosis-related, the study says. After a lung biopsy, doctors stopped the anti-tuberculosis drug and the drugvildagliptin, and the woman died of lung cancer in April, LiveScience reports. The patient had no pets, no history of lung cancer, and no history of allergic reactions to the drug, the study says. It's not clear why the woman developed the lung disease, but doctors suspect it could have something to do with the drug's effect on the body's

– When an 86-year-old Brazilian woman began vomiting and had trouble swallowing, doctors suspected she had an aortic aneurysm, the world's largest body of blood vessels that carries blood from the heart to the abdomen. But an X-ray showed no sign of the aneurysm, so doctors decided to perform a CT scan. What they found instead: a massive buildup of barium in the woman's esophagus, which led them to believe she had an aortic aneurysm, the New York Daily News reports. The woman had been diagnosed with primary hypertension, congestive heart failure, moderate regurgitation, and kyphosis, a narrowing of the aortic valve, before the CT scan, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal. The study's lead author says the woman's symptoms had worsened over the last six months, and she had ingested only semisolids and liquids. The cause of the buildup of barium was not immediately clear, but the woman's symptoms were similar to those of people who have an aortic aneurysm, according to a press release. The cause of the buildup of barium was not immediately clear, but the woman's symptoms were similar to those of people who have an aneurysm.

– If you've ever suffered a traumatic injury that left you unable to walk, talk, or eat, you may want to think again. A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine finds that a relatively simple surgery called " laparoscopy" can successfully repair a variety of injuries to organs such as the liver, spleen, kidney, intestines, stomach, pancreas, urinary bladder, and vessels, the BBC reports. laparoscopy involves a small incision in the abdomen that allows a doctor to "see" the peritoneal cavity, where the injuries to the organs are located, according to a press release. In the study, 25 patients of either sex who'd suffered a traumatic organ injury were treated with laparoscopy, and researchers found that after just two weeks, 90% of them were able to walk, talk, and eat again. They also found that the procedure was as effective as open surgery in repairing many of the injured organs. " laparoscopy is a promising new technique for the treatment of traumatic organ injury," the study's lead author says.

– A cancer drug that causes liver damage, hepatic damage, and other side effects isn't available on the US market yet, but researchers in India say they've figured out a way to deliver it directly to the skin. The technique, which involves using an electric current to delivermethotrexate to the skin, is called transdermal drug delivery and has previously been used to deliver drugs like ointments and creams, the Telegraph reports. The patches are made of a hydrogel, and researchers say they were able to delivermethotrexate more effectively than a previous method, which involved using a solution and then current to deliver the drug to the skin. They found that the current-delivery method caused more damage to skin cells than the previous method did, but the patches were found to be safe and effective in mice, the Guardian reports. "This is the first time that a drug has been delivered directly to the skin," the lead researcher says. "It's like having a razor in your hand."

– If you suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and can't get out of bed, a new study suggests you might want to get moving. Researchers found that people with the chronic, autoimmune disease were up to five times more likely to die from heart disease than the general population, reports the New York Times. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, looked at more than 111,000 people with rheumatoid arthritis and found that those who got at least 75 minutes of moderate exercise a week were 30% less likely to die from heart disease than those who didn't get much exercise. The study's lead author, Dr. Andrew Mente, tells the Times that exercise can help ease the pain of the disease and improve the quality of life of patients, who are often unable to walk or even stand for more than a few minutes at a time. "The benefits of exercise for rheumatoid arthritis can't be overstated," he says in a press release. "It's important for patients to be aware that it's not enough to just get off the couch and go to the gym. It's got to be part of your daily life." The study's authors say that exercise can help ease the effects of the disease, including joint pain, reduced muscle strength, and diminished

– If you can't kick your sugar habit, a new study suggests you might want to try cutting back on fructose. Researchers at the University of Southern California report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that a high- fructose corn syrup diet appears to cause "a significant increase in visceral adipose tissue"—the fat around one's stomach—and "a significant increase in postprandial triglycerides"—the levels of which are linked to heart disease, reports the Los Angeles Times. In other words, if you can't kick your sugar habit, you might want to try cutting back on fructose, which has been linked to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. The researchers fed a high- fructose corn syrup diet to rats and found that the creatures' levels of fat and cholesterol went down, while postprandial triglycerides went up, reports the New York Times. The researchers aren't saying that the diet caused the fat and cholesterol levels to go down, but they did find that the rats on the high- fructose diet ate a lot more sugar than those on the low- fructose diet, reports Live Science. The researchers aren't saying that the diet caused the fat and cholesterol levels to go down, but they did find that the rats on

– If you've ever wanted to look your best while wearing braces, you'll want to check out a new study out of the University of California-San Diego published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Scientists used a special "impeller" to stretch the teeth of rabbits, then observed the animals' facial muscles as they moved around, reports the Los Angeles Times. They found that the stretch made the muscles move faster and more slowly, with the slow fibers becoming more fatigue-resistant and the fast fibers becoming harder to convert to the slow variety. The device is similar to the braces worn by millions of people, and it's not the first time it's been used in orthodontics. But this is the first time it's been used in a non-masticatory manner, meaning it doesn't cause any side effects, reports New Scientist. "This is the first time that a stretch device has been used in a non-masticatory manner to induce a phenotypic change in the fibers of a muscle," the lead researcher says in a press release. "It's also the first time that this has been observed in a non-masticatory manner." It's not clear, however, whether the device will be used in

– Meningiomas are often the most common type of brain tumor, but they're also very common in other parts of the body, including the heart, liver, and lungs. So it's no surprise that researchers report in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that they've found a correlation between those two groups of patients: Those who've had the tumors removed and those who've had them reintroduced into the body. "This is the first time we've seen such a positive association," lead researcher Dr. Jo ⁇ o Dom ⁇ nguez-Rodrigo tells the New York Times. The study looked at 100 patients who'd had their meningiomas removed between 2003 and 2012. Of those, 23 were meningothelial types, 12 were transitional types, 16 were fibrous types, and one was angiomatous. Of those, five had bone soft tissue invasion and one had brain invasion. The median age was 60, and the tumors were found in all but one of the patients. It's not clear how common the correlation is, but Dom ⁇ nguez-Rodrigo tells the Times that it could be because the tumors are more common in the elderly, or because the body's own immune system is fighting them.

– When a 14-year-old boy in the Philippines developed a rash covering his face, neck, and upper limbs, doctors thought it was a common skin condition known as maculopapular eruption. Instead, it turned out to be a rare form of AIDS, reports the New York Times. The boy, who'd been infected with the HIV virus since age 8, became one of the first children in the world to contract the disease via skin-to-skin contact, say researchers in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. They report that in three of four cases, the eruption was so severe that doctors couldn't separate the infected skin from the non-infected skin. "This is the first time we've seen something like this happen with AIDS," the study's lead author tells the Times. "It's very unusual." The virus causes AIDS by infecting white blood cells in the immune system with HIV. When those white blood cells aren't properly fed to the body's immune system, they end up in the skin, where they cause Maculopapular eruptions, or "explosive eruptions," as the researchers call them. In this case, the eruptions were so severe that doctors couldn't separate the infected skin from

– If you're worried about your blood test results, you may want to store them in the freezer for a while. That's according to a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports, which found that at just 20 degrees Fahrenheit, a person's blood test results can be stable for up to 30 days, Popular Science reports. That's especially important when you're trying to determine your risk of heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, because your body needs to react to certain chemicals in your blood to make sure you're getting the right results, Popular Science notes. Researchers looked at 17 blood samples that had been separated from cells and stored at different temperatures for different periods of time—from zero to seven days, to 15 to 30 days, and finally, 30 days—and found that all of them were stable at 20 degrees Fahrenheit for the first seven days, 15 days, and 30 days of storage, and at 20 degrees for the last 30 days, Scientific American reports. "This is the first study to show that a temperature-controlled storage of serum analytes can be safe and effective for long-term stability," the study's lead author says in a press release.

– Milk is good for you, right? Wrong, according to a new study out of Sweden, which found that teens who drink a lot of milk are more likely to be obese. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, looked at more than 2,800 adolescents and preadolescents and found that those who drank a lot of milk were more than twice as likely to be obese as those who drank less, the New York Times reports. The study's lead author, Karin Nilsdotter, tells the Times that milk is a good source of calcium, which is good for your heart. But the study found that teens who drank a lot of milk were more likely to be overweight or obese, according to a press release. The study also found that teens who drank a lot of milk were more likely to be obese than those who drank a lot of fruit. The lead author tells the Times that the study shows that "there is a need for more research on the relationship between milk intake and height in young people." The study also found that teens who drank a lot of milk were more likely to be obese than those who drank a lot of fruit. The lead author tells the Times that milk is a good source of vitamin C, which is good for your heart.

– When it comes to estimating the number of genes in a given human genome, scientists have generally relied on the number of " conserved domains," or parts of a protein's sequence that remain constant across species. But a new study finds that the number of domains in humans is actually far higher than previously believed, reports the Los Angeles Times. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, looked at five different eukaryote genomes: homo sapiens, drosophila melanogaster, arabidopsis thaliana, caenoitis elegans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. Researchers found that the number of domains across all five genomes is closer to the number of genes in each genome, which suggests that " conserved domains are maintained in this ratio as a result of functional constraints on interacting domains," says study co-author Michael Berenbrink of the University of California, San Francisco. "This suggests the possibility that these conserved domains are maintained in this ratio as a result of functional constraints on rearranging interacting domains," he adds in a release. The finding could help scientists better understand how different species interact with each other and how their genomes differ from one another, says Berenbrink. (One of the biggest mysteries surrounding the human genome is

– A particularly nasty form of tuberculosis has been found in Russia, and researchers are warning that it could be on the verge of becoming resistant to common drugs like rifampin and isoniazid. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they've identified a particularly drug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 235 people with the most common form of the disease, reports the New York Times. The most common strain was found in patients from Irkutsk, some 1,200 miles away, but it was also found in patients from yakutia, another Russian city, reports LiveScience. The researchers say this is the first time Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been found to be resistant to common drugs like rifampin and isoniazid, which are used to treat people with drug-resistant forms of the disease. The researchers say they're not sure what's causing the resistance, but they suspect it has something to do with the fact that many of the people in the Irkutsk study had underlying medical conditions that made them vulnerable to drugs. "It's not a completely new finding, but this is the first time it has been found in a population of people who have underlying medical conditions," a researcher tells the Times.

– Men who undergo radical prostatectomy—in which a large portion of the prostate is removed—are usually cancer-free for at least a year, but that doesn't mean they're out of the woods when it comes to erectile dysfunction. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, South Korean researchers found that men who took the drug pde5-is for five days after surgery saw a significant improvement in their sex lives, LiveScience reports. The drug blocks the body's ability to make an enzyme that leads to penile fibrosis, which can lead to erectile dysfunction and other problems. The researchers found that men who took 5mg of pde5-is daily for two weeks after surgery saw a 50% improvement in their sex lives, while those who took 10mg daily for three weeks saw a 30% improvement, according to a press release. The researchers say the findings suggest that men who undergo radical prostatectomy should consider treatment for erectile dysfunction before the procedure is performed, according to the release.

– One of the great mysteries of quantum mechanics has been how to make lasers light up different colors. Now researchers at Stanford University say they've figured out a way to do just that. The trick is to implant different layers of electrons into different layers of quantum dots (Qds) on a single chip, reports the Los Angeles Times. The trick is called "ion implantation induced intermixing," and the researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that it can be used to tune the energy levels of the Qds and make them light up different colors. The upshot is that the devices could someday be used to create more powerful lasers that could be used to do things like map the human brain, study cancer cells, and map the Higgs boson particle, notes Popular Science.

– If you've got a sore throat, a fever, or a rash that doesn't go away, there's a new antibiotic on the market that you may want to try before it's too late. The New York Times reports on a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that found a synthetic version of lincomycin, a common antibiotic used in humans and animals, could fend off the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. The paper explains that lincomycin is a natural antibiotic produced by streptomyces lincolnensis, which was discovered in the 1960s. It's one of three compounds in a class of antibiotics known as lincosamides, and researchers found that they bind to bacteria's ribosomes, which are key to the spread of infections. They found that the synthetic version of lincomycin, called pirlimycin, binds to those ribosomes more effectively than the natural version, according to a press release. The discovery of lincosamides could lead to a new class of antibiotics, one that's "specifically designed to fight bacteria that are resistant to common antibiotics," according to the Times. It's not clear how the new drugs would be effective against resistant bacteria

– An 80-year-old Japanese man died of a rare form of penile cancer just a year after receiving a controversial combination of chemotherapy and radiation, Live Science reports. penile squamous cell carcinoma (pscc) is a relatively rare form of penile cancer and is the leading cause of penile cancer among men in their 20s and 30s, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study states that penile cancer is difficult to treat in any of the clinical stages, "particularly in advanced disease." The 80-year-old was diagnosed with penile squamous cell carcinoma a year ago and had a penectomy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy. A CT scan showed a tumor in his left inguinal region that was 6.5 inches in diameter and had an ulcer and exudate, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The patient was given a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and a zinc paste called mohs, which has been shown to be effective in treating wounds from other cancers. The paste was applied every morning with a gauze to avoid attaching with normal skin, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The tumor shrank after the chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but the patient died a

– An 82-year-old South Korean woman died of a rare form of anemia brought on by a hookworm infection, LiveScience reports. The woman, who lived in a remote area and didn't travel much, had been diagnosed with necator Americanus, an infection that causes iron deficiency. According to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, necator is "rather prevalent in tropics and southern subtropics while necator duodenale ... is in subtropic or northern temperate zones." The woman's entire life had been in the same area, and she had no history of traveling. The study states that it's the first known case of necator Americanus infection in a South Korean patient. The woman died of chronic iron deficiency anemia, which was brought on by the parasite that causes the hookworm, LiveScience reports. According to the study, the woman's iron levels were stable until she was admitted to a hospital in 2007 complaining of shortness of breath and dizziness. Tests showed she had 3,428mg of iron in her blood and 5,410mg of worms in her duodenum. The worms were round and in shape, LiveScience reports. The study states that necator Americanus

– A new respiratory virus has been identified in children in Spain, and researchers are warning that it could be a precursor to gastroenteritis in adults. Hbov—short for hbov—is a common cause of respiratory tract infection in humans, though it's not known to cause gastroenteritis in humans, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers say they detected the virus in the feces of two children who had diarrhea after swallowing respiratory secretions, according to a press release. The virus was also found in the feces of another child who had respiratory symptoms but also diarrhea. Researchers say the presence of the virus in feces could be a sign that it is entering the body through the digestive system and causing illness in humans. "This is the first time we've seen a gastrointestinal pathogen in humans," the study's lead author tells the Los Angeles Times. "It's also the first time we've seen a respiratory pathogen in humans." Hbov was identified in the feces of 520 children in Spain who had acute respiratory infection between 2005 and 2006, according to the study. Of those, 48 had the new virus. Researchers say the presence of the virus in feces could be a sign that it is entering the body through the

– When a 7-year-old boy in Spain was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, doctors didn't think much of it. The disorder, which is a form of renal dysplasia, is so rare it's called "one of the most frequently identified congenital urinary tract abnormalities," according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. But when the boy was born, he had a kidney that was too small for his developing brain and body to get rid of, reports Live Science. The boy's condition is so rare that doctors didn't think they'd ever be able to diagnose it, according to a press release. But when they did, they were amazed to discover that the boy had a rare form of cancer. Doctors were able to identify the cause of the cancer, called leiomyoma, using DNA from the boy's mother and father. "This is the first time we've seen such a rare form of cancer in a child," the study's lead author says. "It's very exciting." The boy's condition is so rare that only about one in 4300 live births in the US are diagnosed with it, according to the study. Doctors say the boy's

– If you're over the age of 50 and have high blood pressure, a new study suggests that your risk of developing peripheral artery disease (pad) may be even higher than previously thought. Researchers looked at data from two large and well-characterized studies, one involving 121 701 female nurses aged 30 to 55 and the other involving 529 male dentists, optometrists, pharmacists, and veterinarians aged 40 to 75, reports the New York Times. They found that people with high levels of two kidney markers, 2microglobulin and cystatin c, as well as low levels of creatinine—a marker of kidney function—were more likely to develop pad, which is caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries, than those with normal levels of creatinine and low levels of 2microglobulin and cystatin c, reports the Los Angeles Times. "Kidney function has long been recognized as a risk factor for pad, but there has been no evidence to support an association between kidney function and the development of pad," the lead researcher says in a press release. "Our study shows for the first time that two markers of kidney function, 2microglobulin and cystatin c, are also associated with the development of pad." The researchers say that people with high creatinine levels should be checked for pad

– "There is no reason for premature pessimism." That's what a top cancer researcher is saying after a number of promising cancer drugs failed in clinical trials. angiogenesis, the process by which blood vessels grow, is "one of the hallmarks of cancer," the researcher writes in the New England Journal of Medicine. "However, there is no reason for premature pessimism, as revealed by current ongoing trials and the clinical developmental status of anti-angiogenic drugs." Most of the 20 or so "angiogenesis inhibitors" being tested in clinical trials in the 1990s were monotherapies, meaning they blocked only one or several functions of endothelial cells, the cells that form blood vessels, the researcher explains in a post at Eureka Alert. Some of the drugs failed because of toxicities, while others failed because they didn't work as well as they should. "There are flaws in the methods used to select these inhibitors, as well as an oversimplified view of tumor vasculature pathophysiology," the researcher writes. Another problem: Different tumors respond to different anti-angiogenic drugs.

– The world's last remaining blue rhino, Sudan, is recovering from a tracheostomy procedure that saved his life, the BBC reports. The 45-year-old male rhino, who died in December, had been unable to breathe for more than two years due to a tracheostomy hole in his throat that had become infected. Doctors were able to insert a tube into the hole, which allowed air to pass through his throat. Sudan's death was the first time a blue rhino had been successfully treated for tracheostomy, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The tracheostomy was the first of its kind in the world and was performed by a single physician and nurse at a hospital in Milan, Italy, according to a press release. The tracheostomy was the first time a blue rhino had been successfully treated for tracheostomy. Sudan's death was the result of complications from the tracheostomy, including bleeding and infection, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers say the tracheostomy procedure is safer than tracheostomy for patients with a tracheostomy hole, according to the BBC. "This is the first time a blue rhino has been successfully treated for tracheostomy," the lead author of the study

– A new treatment for age-related macular degeneration appears to be as effective as surgery to fix the disease, researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine. They studied 25 patients over the age of 50 who received intravitreal injections of the anti-VEGF antibody ranibizumab. At the start of the study, each patient received three monthly injections of 0.5mg of ranibizumab; at the end of the saturation phase, each patient received further injections based on activity of the disease. At the end of the saturation phase, each patient's visual acuity had improved by an average of 18 percentage points over the course of the study. ranibizumab blocks the growth of new blood vessels in the retina, which is a key step in the progression of age-related macular degeneration, reports the Los Angeles Times. In this phase, the patients received surgery to fix the disease; in the next phase, they received further injections based on activity of the disease. At the end of the saturation phase, each patient's visual acuity had improved by an average of 18 percentage points. ranibizumab is currently only available in the US for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, but researchers say it could be used for other diseases as well.

– If you've got a bad case of fluorosis, you may want to stop using glass ionomers in your dental restorations. That's according to a new study published in Scientific Reports, which found that the bleaching process used to make glass ionomers actually releases more fluoride into the body of a patient's mouth than is necessary to restore a damaged tooth. The study looked at three types of glass ionomer restorations: commercial products (hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide), home bleaching products (a blend of hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide), and restorations made with opalescence xtra boost (hydrogen peroxide with a pH of 7 and opalescence quick ( 35%carbamide peroxide with ph of 6). The good news: Home bleaching products had a pH of 5.66 to 7.3, while commercial products had a range of 3.6 to 6.5. The bad news: The bleaching process releases more fluoride into the body of a patient's mouth than is necessary to restore a damaged tooth. "Our results show that the bleaching process releases more fluoride into the body of a patient's mouth than is necessary to restore a damaged tooth," the study's lead author says in a press release. "This is a major concern for patients who use glass ion

– It's a simple procedure, and one that's been used for more than a century: the bronchoscopy, in which a doctor inserts a flexible, fiber-optic bronchoscope into the lungs. Today, it's used to diagnose a wide range of conditions, from allergies and asthma to tumors and, in one high-profile case, pneumonia. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at the science of the procedure, which is still fairly new—the first bronchoscope was invented in 1897—and how it's been evolving over the years. It's been used to diagnose everything from allergies and asthma to tumors and, in one high-profile case last year, pneumonia. Here's what you need to know: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends bronchoscopy only be used in patients who have a severe case of pneumonia or who are at high risk for pneumonia because of underlying lung conditions. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology recommends that doctors use bronchoscopy only in patients who have a severe case of pneumonia or who are at high risk for pneumonia because of underlying lung conditions.

– A new study out of India suggests that people who are obese but have a healthy waist-to-hip ratio are more likely to have a condition known as metabolic syndrome, which can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. The researchers looked at more than 5,600 adults in a rural area of the state of Haryana, and found that those with a healthy waist-to-hip ratio but a BMI of 30 or higher were more than twice as likely to have the condition, reports the New York Times. The researchers say that the ratio is especially important for people who have a family history of diabetes or high blood pressure, reports the Times. The condition is caused by a number of factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, a family history of heart disease or stroke, and a BMI of 30 or higher. Researchers say that people with a healthy waist-to-hip ratio but a BMI of 30 or higher are more likely to have the condition, which can be treated with diet and exercise, reports the Los Angeles Times. (In the US, researchers recently found that people with a healthy waist-to-hip ratio but a BMI of 30 or higher are less likely to have metabolic syndrome.)

– If you suffer from gum disease, it may be time to stock up on antibiotics. A new study finds that people with a genetic mutation that makes them more likely to develop gum disease have a higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, reports the New York Times. The genetic mutation, known as IL-10, makes a person's white blood cells—or leukocytes—more active and thus more likely to release inflammatory cytokines, which in turn trigger inflammation, per a press release. The more active the leukocytes, the more likely a person is to develop gum disease, according to the study, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. Researchers found that people with the IL-10 mutation were more likely to develop chronic periodontitis, which is caused by the body's response to bacteria in the periodontal (gum) tissue. They also had a higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. The study's lead author, Dr. Supat Thammasitboon, tells the Times that people with the gene mutation are a lot more likely to suffer from gum disease, which is caused by the body's immune system not making enough of the white blood cells it needs to fight off bacteria. "It's a major public health problem," he says. "If we can find a way

– Men who eat a lot of soy products may have a lower risk of getting the most common form of prostate cancer, according to a new study. Researchers found that men who ate a lot of isoflavones—a type of phytoestrogen that's found in soy, beans, and tofu—had a 30% lower risk of developing the cancer than did men who ate a lot of red meat, the New York Times reports. The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, also found that men who ate a lot of miso soup had a 30% lower risk of developing the cancer than did men who ate a lot of fat. The researchers believe isoflavones may have an effect on the body's ability to fight off cancer, but more research is needed to confirm the findings.

– It's the most common childhood brain tumor in the world, and researchers are reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they've found a potential new way to treat it. As Live Science explains, medulloblastoma is a type of brain tumor that grows in the cerebellum. It's also one of the few brain tumors that doesn't grow in the brain itself. But it does grow in some areas of the brain, including the cerebellum. Researchers found that medulloblastoma cells have a gene that makes them produce a protein called mirna, which is known to play a role in regulating a number of biological processes. When mirna levels are high in medulloblastoma cells, they produce a protein called p53, which is also known to play a role in cancer. When it's low, the mirnas produce a second protein, erk1/2, which is also known to play a role in cancer. When the two proteins aren't working together, the mirnas produce a third protein, mrnas, which is also known to play a role in cancer. When the two aren't working together, the mirnas produce another protein, tp53, which is also known to play a role in cancer. Researchers found that

– Women who've tried everything from laser hair removal to Botox can now say goodbye to those "crow's feet" and hello to a younger-looking face, at least according to a new study out of South Korea. Reporting in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers say that women who received either low-level laser therapy or radiofrequency therapy for six weeks saw no significant differences in the appearance of wrinkles or other signs of aging. The study was small, with just 30 participants, but the results could have a big impact on plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery treatments, the New York Times reports. "This is the first study to show that low-level laser therapy is safe and effective in reducing the signs of aging in the face and body," the lead researcher says in a press release. The laser, which is emitted from a device called a alexandrite laser, was found to be more effective than either laser in reducing the appearance of crow's feet and lines around the eyes, as well as in improving skin tone and reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation. The researchers say that the technology could also be used to treat other skin issues, such as acne and vitiligo. (Another recent study found that Botox can be both safe and effective.)

– A simple blood test can detect a person's risk of a heart attack in as little as nine minutes, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Wall Street Journal reports researchers from France's Ecole Polytechnique used a technique called immunochemical assays to detect the heart biomarker troponin, which is found in the blood of people who have a history of heart attacks. Previously, it was possible to detect the biomarker in just 18 minutes, according to a press release. The new technique, which can be used on blood samples taken from a person's entire body, can detect a person's risk of a heart attack in as little as three minutes, according to the study. Researchers say it's a big improvement over the current standard test, which requires a patient's blood to be tested multiple times over a short period of time. The new test—which can detect a person's risk of a heart attack by measuring the levels of troponin and myoglobin in blood, according to the New York Times—was shown to be as accurate as the standard test in detecting a person's risk of a heart attack, according to the study. Researchers say it could be used to determine whether a person's risk of a heart attack

– When a 50-year-old man went to the hospital complaining of abdominal pain, doctors suspected he had acute pancreatitis. But when a skin biopsy on his left lower leg four days later revealed "a diffuse subcutaneous fat necrosis and ghost—like cells with thick shadowy walls and no nuclei," doctors decided he had pancreatic panniculitis, a rare condition in which pancreatic enzymes kill fat cells in the pancreas, Live Science reports. The man's condition worsened and he and his family refused treatment for 10 days, until a CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed "a swollen pancreas with an dilated pancreatic duct, a loculated fluid collection in the left anterior perirenal space, multiple hepatic cysts, and massive ascites," according to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Physicians. The skin biopsy revealed "a fine granular basophilic material deposited within and around the necrotic fat cells," according to the study. The man died on the fourth day of treatment. Pancreatic panniculitis is extremely rare—only one other case in 893 patients has been reported since 1883—but it can be caused by other pancreatic disorders, including post-traumatic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, pancreas divisum, and hemophagocytic syndrome, according to the

– When a 30-year-old woman went to the emergency room at Montefiore Medical Center in New York last month with a blood clot on her lung, she was told she had acute lymphocytic leukemia, the New York Daily News reports. But the blood test she was given—a simple blood test called Point-of-Care Testing, or poct—wasn't accurate, and she ended up getting a blood test for HIV that turned out to be wrong, according to a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The patient was treated at the hospital's burn unit, but it wasn't until the next day that doctors realized what had happened. The Point-of-Care Testing process involves collecting a patient's blood sample, prepping it for analysis, and sending it off to a lab, where it's analyzed, the Daily News reports. But it's not just hospitals that need to be aware of their processes. " errors can occur in any phase of laboratory testing whether performed in a central laboratory or at the point-of-care," the New England Journal of Medicine states. "risk management is defined as the systematic application of management policies, procedures, and practices to the tasks of analyzing, evaluating, controlling, and monitoring

– If you're a back athlete, you may want to think twice before popping a pill to ease the pain, according to a new study out of Romania. Researchers at the University of Sfax in that country report in the journal PLOS ONE that back injuries are the No. 1 cause of lost time from school and the second leading cause of injury overall. They found that back pain can last for up to two months after an injury and last up to a year after one, reports the New York Times. The researchers looked at more than 5,600 students between the ages of 12 and 17. They found that those who had had back pain in the past were more likely to be obese or overweight than students who didn't have back pain at all, reports Live Science. "Our results show that back pain can last for up to two months after an injury and last up to a year after one," the lead researcher says in a press release. "This shows that there is a need to pay attention to the prevention of back pain in young people." The researchers say the findings should be applied to both children and adults. (Swedish researchers found that back pain can be eased with the right stretching.)

– If you're one of the millions of people who suffer a heart attack and are successfully resuscitated after it, you may want to think twice about shivering. A new study suggests that shivering may actually hamper the body's ability to heal itself after a heart attack, reports the New York Times. Researchers found that pigs injected with a drug called sevoflurane saw their cerebral cortex shrink and their neurological defect score fall. The drug, which blocks the body's production of a protein linked to brain inflammation, is currently used to treat heart attack patients. "The idea is to prevent the body from going into a vicious cycle of vasoconstriction and shivering," the lead researcher tells the Times. "The body doesn't have the ability to heal itself after a heart attack." In the study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the researchers found that the sevoflurane-induced cooling didn't increase the levels of a protein linked to brain inflammation. They did, however, find that the cooling lowered the levels of a protein linked to tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 in the myocardial fluid of the pigs. The researchers say the drug should be used in heart attack patients who don't respond to sevoflu

– It's been more than 60 years since the first nuclear bomb was dropped on Earth, and the waste from those bombs and other weapons has been sitting around waiting to be disposed of. The problem is that it's taking so long to dispose of, and it's going to take a lot longer than expected, reports the Guardian. The problem is that the materials are so old, they're not going to be able to withstand the rigors of modern technology, say researchers at the University of York. They've come up with a novel way to deal with the problem, but it's not going to be easy: They're going to have to build a new barrier, and they're going to have to figure out how to get around it. The problem is that the old ones are going to be long-lived, and the new ones are going to be relatively short-lived, reports the New York Times. The problem is that the old ones are coming out of the ground faster than the new ones are, and that's a problem because the old ones are going to be long-lived, too, but the new ones are going to be relatively short-lived, too.

– A new study suggests that a woman's immune system may play a role in her fetus's development. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, collected blood samples from 16 pregnant women at an average of 9.7 weeks gestation and cryopreserved them until 34 weeks gestation, then again at 34 weeks and 34 weeks, reports the New York Times. They found that the women's immune systems changed over the course of the pregnancy, with a particular surge in "cytokines"— proteins that trigger the body's immune system to attack invading bacteria and viruses. The upshot is that the women's immune systems changed in a way that allowed the fetus to fight off pathogens, while at the same time allowing the women to maintain their normal levels of immune function, reports the Los Angeles Times. The researchers, whose study is published in the Journal of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, say the findings add to the growing body of evidence that a healthy immune system is important for the health of both the mother and the fetus. But they warn that more research is needed to confirm their findings and that more study is needed to see if the women's immune systems actually change over the course of the pregnancy.

– If you want to lose weight but don't want to work out every day, a new study suggests you might want to take antioxidant vitamins. Researchers found that people who took vitamin E for two weeks had lower levels of fat than those who took a dummy pill, LiveScience reports. The vitamin acts as a "chain" in the body to protect cells from oxidative damage—it breaks down fat more quickly than other antioxidants—and the researchers say it's a good idea to take vitamin E alongside a nutritious diet. The study, published in the American Journal of Physiology: Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, looked at 27 men and women between the ages of 18 and 50. The subjects were split into two groups: one that took the vitamin daily for two weeks and one that took a dummy pill every day for four weeks. After four weeks, the men and women's levels of fat, cholesterol, and other markers of health were lower in the vitamin-treated group than in the placebo group. The New York Times reports that while the study doesn't prove that taking vitamin E causes people to lose weight, it does show that people who take it have lower levels of fat than those who don't.

– When a 45-year-old Japanese woman went to the doctor, she was shocked to find that she had a rare and incredibly rare condition called acromegaly. It's caused by a growth on the pituitary gland that triggers a surge of hormones that can cause extreme inflammation of the eyes, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The woman's condition is so rare that doctors didn't even know she had it until she went to the doctor, the Guardian reports. "I was completely shocked," says Dr. Hideo Sawada, the lead author of the study. "I had never heard of acromegaly before, and I had never heard of a person with acromegaly before." The woman's condition is so rare that it's not clear how common it is, but it's thought to affect one out of every 100,000 people, according to the Guardian. Sawada says the woman's condition is so rare that it's not even clear if there's another cause for the inflammation. According to a press release, the woman's condition is so rare that no other known cases of acromegaly—an extremely rare condition that affects one out of every 100,000 people—have been

– Those with asthma might want to take note: A new study out of China suggests that the chronic condition may actually increase your risk of migraine. Researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong report in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine that they looked at the health records of more than 41,000 people with asthma in Taiwan, then compared those records to those of more than 1 million without asthma between 1996 and 2011. They found that asthma patients had a 26% higher risk of migraine compared to those without asthma, reports the New York Times. It's not the first study to suggest a link between asthma and migraines, but the researchers say theirs is the largest study to date to look at the association between asthma and migraines. "Our findings suggest that asthma may be an important risk factor for migraine," the lead researcher says in a press release. "Our findings should not be interpreted as a cause-and-effect relationship, but as a strong association between asthma and migraine." The researchers note that asthma—which can include recurring chest tightness and shortness of breath—is often treated with steroids, which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. (Another recent study found that people who have asthma are more likely to have heart attacks.)

– If you've ever dreamed of having your teeth fixed with a set of brackets, you're in luck: Scientists say they've figured out a way to do so without damaging the enamel on the teeth, Popular Science reports. The old-fashioned way of bonding brackets to teeth involves etching the surface of the teeth, rinsing the surface, drying, and applying resin to the surface, according to a press release. The problem is that the process can cause damage to the tooth's enamel, which can last for years, Popular Science notes. Researchers in Germany say they've figured out a way to bond brackets to teeth without damaging the enamel, using a compound called self- adhesive cements. The compound is "calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate" and "calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate" is "calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate" itself, Popular Science reports. The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, found that the self- adhesive cements held up well against two different types of brackets—one with and one without adhesive. But it wasn't just the brackets that held up well: The study found that the self- adhesive cements also held up better against brackets with adhesive than those without, Popular Science reports. "

– It's called osteopetrosis, and it's a rare genetic disorder characterized by an increase in bone mass. It's also one of the most common forms of cancer, affecting one in every 100,000 people. But researchers now say they've found a way to slow the progression of the disease in mice, reports the New York Times. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they say that a specific enzyme in osteoclasts—cells that break down bone—appears to play a key role in the progression of osteopetrosis. The enzyme, called plekhm1, is secreted by osteoclasts in response to a buildup of calcium in the bone. When the calcium is broken down, the osteoclasts essentially become osteoblasts, which then create new bone. But when the osteoclasts aren't making enough of the enzyme, the bone grows too fast and breaks down too quickly. This leads to osteopetrosis, in which osteoclasts don't make enough of the enzyme and the bone grows too fast and breaks down too quickly. Researchers say that by blocking the enzyme, they were able to reverse the disease in mice. "This is the first time that

– Japanese children born to parents who survived the March 1945 atomic bombing of Okinawa may have a genetic mutation that makes them more susceptible to cancer, according to a new study. Scientists used DNA-printing technology to create more than 3,000 copies of a mutated version of the human genome in the children of survivors of the bombing, the Telegraph reports. They found that children born to parents who had the mutation were more likely to develop breast cancer, while those born to parents who didn't had the mutation were more likely to develop Alzheimer's. The researchers say the genetic mutation—called segmental copy-number variations, or cnvs—may play a role in diseases like cancer and congenital malformations, according to a press release.

– If you've ever suffered a traumatic brain injury, chances are you've suffered an increase in inflammation, which can lead to permanent brain damage. Now researchers report in the journal Nature Communications that they've figured out a way to counteract that inflammation in the lab, using a gene therapy called nrf2 to do so. nrf2 is a transcription factor that's key to the body's antioxidant response, reports the New York Times. When nrf2 is turned on, cells produce more antioxidant enzymes. When nrf2 is turned off, however, cells produce more inflammatory cytokines, which can lead to brain damage. "Our findings suggest that nrf2 plays a critical role in regulating the brain’s inflammatory response and that treating nrf2 could be a promising new way to treat traumatic brain injury," says lead researcher Dr. Kensler Thomas of Johns Hopkins University, per the Washington Post. The team tested their findings on mice genetically modified to have either nrf2 deficiency or nrf2 deficiency that resulted in increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. When they injected the mice with an antisense drug that blocks the nrf2 gene, they were able to reduce inflammation and improve their motor skills. "Our findings suggest that nrf2 may play a

– You've heard of "big data"—the term used to describe the growing amount of medical information available through electronic medical records. But what about "big data" in critical care? That's the topic at the heart of a new paper from Harvard Medical School researchers, reports the New York Times. "We are experiencing a rapidly expanding collection of vast amounts of clinical data from routine practice and ambulatory monitoring," write the researchers in the journal JAMA. "clinicians must already make sense of a diverse variety of data input streams in order to make clinical decisions." In critical care, that includes things like whether a patient's heart rate is too high or low, how well a patient's breathing is controlled, and how well a patient's blood pressure is stable. The problem is that these decisions are often made in a "high degree of uncertainty" and "clinical staff may have only minutes or even seconds to make those decisions," write the researchers. "We must design better data systems to support and improve those components of this data integration process that exceed human abilities," they write. One possible solution: figuring out how to score patients in critical care. Currently, there are three types of score systems: one for heart rate, one for blood pressure, and one

– A new study finds that hospitals in the central Illinois area have some of the highest rates of drug-resistant bacteria in the country. Researchers tested 77 hospitals in the area and found that 64% of isolates tested were resistant to at least one common bacteria, including E. faecalis and enterococcus faecalis, NBC News reports. In fact, hospitals in the southwest area had 91% of isolates that were resistant to at least one common bacteria, according to the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study's lead author tells the Chicago Tribune that hospitals in the area need to do a better job of keeping patients healthy and figuring out how to treat them if bacteria becomes resistant to common drugs. "It's a public health emergency," he says.

– Pandemic H1N1 was declared a national epidemic in June of last year, but a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows just how widespread the disease was in most states at the time. Of the 36 states that reported weekly influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths from Aug. 30 through April 6, only six reported a total of more than 10,000 hospitalizations, the New York Times reports. That's down from a peak of 40 states in mid-September, but up from a low of 16 states in early October. Of the 36 states that reported hospitalizations, 17 reported syndromic cases, meaning they reported a laboratory-confirmed hospitalization or death, while 33 reported laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations and 20 reported syndromic hospitalizations. The District of Columbia reported the fewest hospitalizations, with just two. But the number of syndromic hospitalizations was higher than the number of laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations, suggesting that hospitals underreported the number of cases, the Times notes.

– When a 45-year-old woman in India fell and hit her head on the pavement, she suffered a traumatic shoulder injury that left her in pain and unable to move her arm—but she didn't need to undergo surgery. The woman had no history of epilepsy, previous shoulder dislocations, or instability in other joints, doctors report in a case study published in the British Medical Journal. The woman "had no history of seizure, epilepsy, previous shoulder dislocation or instability in other joints," the doctors write. "immediately post trauma ... there was loss of round contour of shoulder with increased vertical diameter of axilla anteriorly." The woman's right shoulder was also dislocated, but she didn't need to undergo surgery. Doctors say the woman's left shoulder was also dislocated, but she didn't need to undergo surgery.

– Guys who grow up to be obese may have an advantage over those who don't, according to a new study in the British Medical Journal. Researchers looked at more than 3,000 men who were born after World War II and found that those who grew up to be obese were more likely to be obese as adults, reports the New York Times. Specifically, those who grew up to be obese were more likely to be obese as adults than those who grew up to be non-obese. Those who grew up to be obese were also more likely to be obese than those who grew up to be non-obese. The study's lead author, Dr. Andrew Mente, tells the Times that the study shows that "obesity is a risk factor for a range of health problems," including heart disease, cancer, and Type 2 diabetes. Mente tells the BBC that the study shows that people who grow up to be obese should be checked for health problems later in life. (Another recent study found that men who grow up to be obese are more likely to be obese later in life.)
