– Identity Thief, starring Melissa McCarthy, Jason Bateman, and John Cho, tells the story of a con artist who snatches a victim's credit cards and uses them to rack up thousands of dollars in charges on her own. What critics are saying: "Think of this as a movie review or as just a friendly warning from a like-minded individual: Identity Thief is so bad it’s hard to believe it wasn’t directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers," writes Lou Lumenick in the New York Post. The movie is "so bad it’s hard to believe it wasn’t directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers," writes Rex Reed in the New York Observer. "In order to stretch a five-minute idea into 107 minutes of contrived drivel some people may mistake for plot, the plan backfires. She beats him up, steals his wallet, wrecks his rental car, and leaves him stranded on the highway in a pair of pants stolen from a dead hobo." The movie is "so bad it’s hard to believe it wasn’t directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers," writes Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. McCarthy, he says, "has devoted her short

– If critics are to be believed, Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant is the best installment in the series since the first two. Here's what they're saying: "This beautifully made sci-fi thriller will immeasurably boost fan interest in the run of prequels, which Scott has recently said will consist of at least two more films until the action catches up to the 1979 original," writes Kenneth Turan at the Los Angeles Times. "This Fox release is a lock for major early summer box-office worldwide." It's "the most satisfying entry in the six-film-and-counting franchise since the first two," writes Peter Travers at Rolling Stone. Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, and Billy Crudup give "some real surprises" here, he adds. The film "feels vital, freshly thought out, and keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow," writes Peter Howell at the Toronto Star. The script is "mesmerizing," he writes, but "once this element is introduced, the writers don't do much with it, so it feels like a missed opportunity to engage in some religion vs

"We have indeed decided as a precautionary measure to close our premises, embassies, consulates, cultural centers, and schools," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. France's prime minister said anyone offended by the cartoons can take them to court, the BBC reports.

– Herman Cain's campaign has yet to comment on a new 13-track gospel album that appeared online yesterday, but the Daily Caller says it's definitely not the candidate. The album, Sunday Morning, was recorded 15 years ago by GLC Music, Selah Sound Production & Melodic Praise Records, and it features Cain on vocals, guitar, and guitar parts, along with Georgia Rep. Thaddeus McCotter on guitar and drums, Mediaite reports. It's "mostly standard gospel fare and mostly slow tracks at that, with one standout single: 'This is the Day,' a fast-paced track reminiscent of 'Footloose,'" writes Dave Weigel. "It is worth noting that it not yet 100% certain this is Herman Cain—Dave Weigel notes that the Cain campaign has yet to comment on the album, but 'it's real, it was published 15 years ago by GLC Music, Selah Sound Production & Melodic Praise Records, and it is not being distributed now by the Cain campaign,'" he adds.

– The estranged wife of acclaimed concert pianist Vadym Kholodenko has been ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial for allegedly killing the couple's two young daughters by smothering them with pillows. Sofya Tsygankova has been ordered committed by a Texas judge to a state mental health facility for 120 days of treatment with the hope that she will be able to face justice when she regains "a reasonable degree of rational understanding," court records revealed Wednesday, per NBC News. Tsygankova, 32, has pleaded not guilty to charges of killing daughters Nika, 5, and Michaela, 1, at their Benbrook, Texas, home. Kholodenko, 30, is a Ukrainian musician whose critically acclaimed career took off after he won the gold medal at the 14th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 2013. Police said that when the pianist arrived at his wife's home March 17 to pick up the girls and take them to preschool, he found Tsygankova covered in blood with cuts on her wrists and the two children dead in their beds. Tsygankova had visited a state mental health facility in Fort Worth a day before her daughters were found dead, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Inside the home, police found

– The editor-in-chief of the New York Review of Books has been forced out over an essay he wrote about former Canadian broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi, who has been accused of sexual assault and harassment by at least 20 women. In the essay, Ian Buruma wrote that he wanted to give a more "nuanced" view of what had happened to Ghomeshi, who was acquitted in 2016 after being accused of sexual assault and choking by three women. Buruma's article was strongly criticized by women's rights groups and other critics who said it minimized the seriousness of Ghomeshi's crimes. Buruma resigned from the prestigious literary magazine on Wednesday, the Guardian reports. "As editor of the New York Review of Books I published a theme issue about #MeToooffenders who had not been convicted in a court of law but by social media. And now I myself am publicly pilloried," he told Dutch magazine Vrij Nederland, per the Guardian. Ghomeshi, who was fired by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2014 after allegations of physical abuse were made against him, has apologized to all the women who accused him of sexual abuse or harassment. In his essay, Buruma wrote that he had been "publicly pilloried" and "

– A group of divers in Mexico has made an amazing discovery: the world's biggest flooded cave. The Gran Acuifero Maya (GAM) says the 215-mile-long cave system in the Yucatan peninsula is connected to the larger Dos Ojos system more than 200 miles away, making it the biggest flooded cave on the planet, National Geographic reports. "This immense cave represents the most important submerged archaeological site in the world, since it has more than a hundred archaeological contexts, among which is evidence of the first settlers of America, as well as the extinct fauna and, of course, of the Maya culture," says GAM's director of exploration, Guillermo de Anda. GAM says it spent 10 months exploring the underwater channels before discovering the connection between the two cave systems. "It allows us to appreciate much more clearly how the rituals, the pilgrimage sites, and ultimately the great pre-Hispanic settlements that we know emerged," de Anda tells Reuters. According to the rules of caving, when two cave systems are connected, the largest cave absorbs the smallest, so the name of the latter disappears. The Sac Actun System is 163 miles long, the Ox Bel Ha System is 167 miles long, and the Koal Baal System is 57 miles long.

– A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Dallas had to return to Seattle on Sunday because someone forgot to unload a human heart on board, the Seattle Times reports. According to KOMO, the heart had arrived in Seattle from Sacramento on Saturday. It was supposed to be unloaded before the plane left for Dallas, but it wasn't until the pilot took off for Dallas that the airline realized the "life-critical cargo shipment" was still on the plane. "We made the decision to return to Seattle to ensure the shipment was delivered to its destination within the window of time allotted by our cargo customer," CNN quotes Southwest as saying in a statement. The heart was unloaded from the plane after three hours in the air, and the flight took off again for Dallas after a five-hour delay. It's not clear what the heart was intended for, and no Seattle-area hospitals were involved in the shipment. Passenger Andrew Gottschalk calls the incident a "horrific story of gross negligence," but says everyone on board "was happy to save a life."

– A 3-year-old boy is in stable condition after falling into a jaguar exhibit at the Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas yesterday, KTHV reports. According to a police report seen by Arkansas Matters, the boy's father and grandfather saw him fall into the exhibit and both ran to get help. The father threw something at the animals to keep them at bay, but one ran off, and the other circled back and bit the boy on the back of the neck. The father then threw something else at the cats to get them to release, but they circled back again and bit the boy. A keeper heard screams for help and ran to the exhibit to see one of the jaguars with its mouth around the boy's neck. Zoo workers arrived with a fire extinguisher to keep the cats away from the boy, THV11 reports. A staffer climbed into the exhibit with a ladder to get the boy out, then handed him to his father. The boy was taken to Arkansas Children's Hospital. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the child and the family," the zoo said in a statement. "The safety of our citizens is of paramount value and our staff followed training procedures on rescuing the child and were able to respond quickly and efficiently."

– Bloomingdale's has apologized for an ad in its holiday catalog that some saw as encouraging date rape. The ad shows a woman laughing with her head turned as a young man looks her way. The text reads: "Spike Your Best Friend's Eggnog When They're Not Looking." The Wall Street Journal reports that there have been nearly 4,000 social media comments about the ad in the past 48 hours, most of them negative, and that most of them are calling it "creepy." "In reflection of recent feedback, the copy we used in our current catalog was inappropriate and in poor taste," Bloomingdale's said in a statement. " Bloomingdale's sincerely apologizes for this error in judgment."

– A Roman Catholic priest in California has taken a leave of absence after it was revealed that he had a long-term relationship with a school superintendent. Nancy Kotowski, 59, and Rev. Mike Manning, 70, are cousins on her mother's side and did not grow up together, she tells the Monterey Herald. Manning left for the seminary when he was 14, and she was 3. "We're soul mates, and in any human relationship, especially one of over 30 years, you reach a decision-making point, and our relationship reached that point," Kotowski says. "It's a 30-year relationship of love for one another. That's what it was." Kotowski, who has never married or had children, says she and Manning are now embracing celibacy. "It's a struggle, but we know God is calling to us, so we honor that," she says.

– President Trump has taken his war of words with the Federal Reserve to a new level, telling the Wall Street Journal that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell "almost looks like he's happy raising interest rates." The president, who last week slammed the central bank as "going loco" and "out of control," also said he "maybe" regretted nominating Powell to the position. The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year, with a fourth increase likely coming at the end of the year, and Trump said the biggest risk to the economy was not tariffs or a trade war, but rather the fact that the Fed is raising rates too quickly, NBC News reports. Trump complained that former President Obama didn't have to deal with "zero interest" rates from the Fed, which held rates artificially low for almost a decade in order to allow the economy to grow after the 2008 recession. "How the hell do you compete with that?" he said. Presidents have for decades refrained from commenting on the Fed, a stance adopted to avoid compromising its independence—and its credibility with financial markets.

– A TV station in Oakland, Calif., is taking heat after airing a photo of a slain teen that some say shows her holding what looks like a gun. Nia Wilson, 18, was fatally stabbed on a train Sunday night by a man who attacked her and her sister without saying a word, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. The photo of Wilson was shown on KTVU's This Week with George Stephanopoulos Monday morning. The station said it chose the photo from Wilson's Instagram account "out of respect" for her and "in keeping with our commitment to telling the story in a sensitive and authentic way." The photo has since been removed from the station's website. In a Facebook post, Wilson's father says the photo was "a basically a gag" and "gives us a real glimpse into the sick psychology of exactly who we are dealing with and fighting against." "How cruel, how evil, how heartless, how crass, how foul do you have to be, how rotten must you be from the inside out, how dry and dead must your soul be—to have the idea that you want to interrupt grieving people and demean them the day after their loved one was murdered?" he writes. "It never will happen."

– Julian Assange is not a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of him in the new movie The Fifth Estate, and he's not happy about it either. In a letter to Cumberbatch, Assange says he tried to contact the actor before shooting began, but Cumberbatch's assistants got in touch and asked Assange to meet, the Huffington Post reports. Assange says he thought he would "enjoy meeting you," but "I believe that it is going to be overwhelmingly negative for me and the people I care about. I believe that it is based on a deceitful book by someone who has a vendetta against me and my organization." "Your skills play into the hands of people who are out to remove me and WikiLeaks from the world," Assange continues. "I believe that you should reconsider your involvement in this enterprise." The movie is based on the book Inside WikiLeaks: My Time With Julian Assange and the World’s Most Dangerous Website by Daniel Domscheit-Berg. Dreamworks, which produced the film, "decided to base its script only on the most toxic. So toxic is the first book selected by Dreamworks that it is distributed to US military bases as a mechanism to discourage military personnel from communicating with us," Assange writes.

– On Thursday, Pope Francis is expected to deliver his first major teaching letter on the environment—and scientists say it could have a bigger impact than international negotiations on climate change this year. "The encyclical is going to go out to over 1 billion Catholics—that's a way of getting a message across to a segment of society that the scientific community could never do," Jeff Kiehl with the National Center for Atmospheric Research tells USA Today. "I mean it's just unbelievable." Francis has said climate change is a moral imperative, and the New York Times reports that he shifted the topic of his teaching letter from poverty to the environment during a meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last year. "This is the pope of the poor," Robert Orr, Ban's special adviser on climate change, tells the Times. "The fact that he is making the link to the planet is really significant." The pope's teaching letter will be issued by a Catholic cardinal, a Christian Orthodox church leader, and a climate scientist the Vatican identifies as an atheist, USA Today reports. Catholic leaders say they hope it will transcend partisan fighting over the causes of climate change. "The church has gotten it wrong a few times on science, and I think that we probably are better

– Herman Cain's latest campaign ad is getting a lot of attention for a few reasons, including the chief of staff's smoking. "It has been quite a while, if ever, since we’ve seen an ad like this," notes Mediaite. "A close-up of Block speaking takes up most of the time, giving the impression that this is a normal campaign spot, until he concludes that 'together we can do this. Together we can take this country back.' Then things get weird," adds the Huffington Post. "The end of the sentence prompts the beginning of a dramatic song with a woman proclaiming 'I AM AMERICA' (it’s a song we’ve heard before, by Krista Branch), and, for some reason, serves a cue for Block to reveal in slow motion that he is smoking a cigarette. He takes a breath and blows nicotine into the camera while Branch sings the chorus of her song. A profile of Herman Cain then fades into view, concluding one of the most bizarre 5-10 second chunks of film in some time."

– In her first public comments since the release of a 2005 tape in which her husband is heard bragging about sexually assaulting women, Melania Trump told Fox News on Tuesday that the comments were "offensive to me and they were inappropriate. And he apologized to me. And I expect—I accept his apology. And we are moving on." Asked what she would tell women deterred by the remarks, she said: "My husband is kind and he's a gentleman. He cares about people. He cares about women." Earlier Monday, Melania Trump told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she believes her husband. "I believe my husband. I believe my husband," she said. "This was all organized from the opposition. And with the details ... did they ever check the background of these women? They don't have any facts." Melania Trump said she hadn't heard her husband use that kind of language before. "No. No, that's why I was surprised, because I said like I don't know that person that would talk that way, and that he would say that kind of stuff in private," she said. "I heard many different stuff—boys talk. The boys, the way they talk when they grow up and they want to sometimes show each other

– In her new memoir, Texas Sen. Wendy Davis reveals that she had an abortion 17 years ago, when she was 17 weeks pregnant with her third daughter, the San Antonio Express-News reports. Davis writes that she and then-husband Jeff decided to terminate the pregnancy after doctors determined that the baby, named Tate Elise, suffered from an acute brain abnormality. "She was suffering," Davis writes. Tate was delivered by cesarean section and died a day later. "An indescribable blackness followed," Davis writes. "It was a deep, dark despair and grief, a heavy wave that crushed me, that made me wonder if I would ever surface. ... And when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person. Changed. Forever changed." Davis, who is running for governor, says she was "heartbroken" over the decision, but the book, Getting to Be Afraid, goes on sale next week and she doesn't expect it to affect her campaign, a political scientist tells the Express-News. "The group that will be most bothered by her having an abortion of a baby with a severe fetal abnormality is a group that wasn't going to vote for her anyway," he says.

– A California waiter has been fired after asking a group of women if they had proof that they were US residents, the Los Angeles Times reports. Diana Carrillo was dining with her sister and friends at Saint Marc Pub-Cafe in Huntington Beach last week when the waiter asked her, "Can I see your proof of residency?" "I already had my ID out. I couldn't say anything," Carrillo tells the Orange County Register. She says the waiter then asked the other three women the same thing, saying, "I need to make sure you're residents before I serve you." Carrillo posted the incident on social media, and the restaurant apologized and said in part, "This type of behavior is not representative of the St. Marc brand and will not be tolerated." Kent Berden, the restaurant's senior director of operations, says he fired the waiter. He says the waiter thought the question was asked "in a joking fashion," but Carrillo isn't buying it. "I feel that's the direction we're headed in, given who's the president," she says.

– Ivins Rosier was 16 when he shot and killed Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Robert Boody's retired police dog Drake, but the Palm Beach Post reports that Rosier was charged as an adult and this week found guilty on charges of cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm, and shooting into a building. He'll be going to prison for 23 years, though his attorneys plan to appeal and argue that he should be sentenced as a juvenile, which would mean less time behind bars. Rosier confessed to shooting Drake after being questioned by a sheriff's office detective, but was charged as an adult and this week put on trial—but not for murdering a cop since Drake was retired and the law treats killing a dog differently than a human. The end result: A guilty verdict on the felony counts of cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm, and shooting into a building. Circuit Judge Robin Rosenberg ordered Rosier, 17, to be held without bail at the Palm Beach County Jail. The defense attorneys plan to revisit their pre-trial argument that Rosier's indictment violates his right to be sentenced as a juvenile, which would mean far less prison time for the offenses.

– The Cleveland police officer who fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice last year told a grand jury Tuesday that he shot the boy because he thought he was in an "active shooter situation," the Guardian reports. "The suspect had a gun, had been threatening others with the weapon, and had not obeyed our command to show us his hands," officer Timothy Loehmann told the grand jury. Loehmann, 27, said he told Tamir to raise his hands repeatedly as the boy was "reaching into his waistband." "I observed the suspect pulling the gun out of waistband and his elbow coming up," Loehmann said. "With his hands pulling the gun out and his elbow coming up, I knew it was a gun and it was coming out ... the threat to my partner and myself was real and active." The grand jury is considering whether to indict Loehmann and his partner, 47-year-old Frank Garmback, who was the driver of the patrol car at the time of the shooting. The officers' statements were read to the grand jury on Tuesday, a day after Tamir's mother testified. "She believes that the answer is plainly no, and hopes and prays that the grand jury agrees that there is probable cause to in

– Retired physicist Charles D. Goodman claims Winfrey's Yellow Brick Road company, the property's former owners, and the town of Mountain Village made a secret deal to close access to the trails that cut across the land purchased for $10.9 million in March, the AP reports. The Denver Post reported Thursday that the former owners, Hoyt and Carol Barnett, asked for a correction to property records shortly before selling the land. Goodman claims that erased easements allowing residents of nearby homes to use the trails. Mountain Village denies the accusation. Town community development director Chirs Hawkins said the correction only cleared up ambiguities and that the town and Winfrey's team want to continue to allow trail access. In a written statement, Yellow Brick Road spokeswoman Wendy Luckenbill said the company will continue to work with the neighbors ensure "reasonable" access for neighbors over portions of the land.

Officials say the FBI has turned over emails between Allen and Jill Kelley, the Florida socialite who complained to the FBI about harassing emails from Petraeus' biographer, Paula Broadwell. Allen, the top US commander in Afghanistan, has denied having an affair with Kelley, or sharing classified information with her.

One would have the NSA running the program, while the other two would have it running it through phone companies, and the third would have it running it through another government agency. President Obama himself said last month that one of those options was "a daring proposal, but come on, this one's a pipe dream."

"I have never been able to fathom why The Catcher in the Rye is such a canonical novel. I read it because everyone else in school was reading it but thought it was totally silly. Now, looking back, I find that it is without any literary merit whatsoever. Why waste adolescents' time? Alternatively, I'd suggest Olivia, the story of a British teenage girl who is sent to a boarding school in France. It is short and written in a kind of levelheaded and deceptively straightforward style. Olivia eventually falls in love with her teacher Mademoiselle Julie T, who in turn, and without reciprocating that love out loud, is equally in love with Olivia. Julie never takes a wrong step, but there are signs for those who know how to read them."

– The 59-year-old man who opened fire in a Lafayette, La., movie theater yesterday, killing two and wounding nine before killing himself, had been arrested at least 10 times over the past 15 years for offenses including arson, selling alcohol to a minor, and speeding, the AP reports. In Alabama, records show John Russel Houser had four speeding tickets and one no-seat ticket between 1981 and 2003. He also filed a small claims court lawsuit in 2004 claiming he was injured when he donated plasma at a Phenix City donation center. The case was settled, according to court records. Police officials said at a news conference today that Houser's arrests date 10 to 15 years ago or more. Those include charges of arson and selling alcohol to a minor. He had been married once in the past but was not currently married.

– Ralph Northam was sworn in as Virginia's 73rd governor on Saturday, and he spent his first night in the Governor's Mansion with his head resting on the mug of his predecessor, Terry McAuliffe. McAuliffe, also a Democrat, had plastered the pillowcase with images of him around the residence and an early morning wake-up call, the Washington Post reports. "There are pictures of the governor all over the mansion that he left for me," Northam says. "Also, at 3 o'clock this morning, an alarm clock went off, which I have yet to find. I texted him and thanked him, and he said there was more to come." Such pranks are common in Virginia, the only state where the governor's office changes hands every four years, the New York Daily News reports. During Bob McDonnell's last gubernatorial changeover, the outgoing governor left a teddy bear in the private bathroom that turned out to be a real bear taken from McDonnell's office.

– A doctor who appears to have been the target of a former physician who started shooting at a hospital, killing one person and injuring six, said he has no idea why he would have been singled out. Dr. Kamran Ahmed told the New York Post he wasn't the only one Dr. Henry Bello had a problem with. However, "he never argued with me," Ahmed said. "I don't know why he put my name." A law enforcement official told the AP that Bello arrived at Bronx Lebanon Hospital in the Bronx on Friday with an assault rifle, which was bought in upstate New York about a week earlier, hidden under his lab coat and asked for a doctor he blamed for his having to resign, but the doctor wasn't there at the time. The law enforcement official wasn't authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahmed, who specializes in the early detection and treatment of dementia, said Bello "had a problem with almost everybody, so I'm not the only one. That's why they fired him, because so many people complained." Before the shooting, Bello sent an email to the Daily News, blaming colleagues he said forced him to resign two years earlier. "This hospital terminated my road to a

– The Weinstein Company has filed for bankruptcy, months after the sexual harassment and assault allegations against co-founder Harvey Weinstein brought down one of Hollywood's most powerful men. The company's board said in a statement that it has entered into a deal with an affiliate of private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners to buy substantially all of the company's assets for up to $1 billion, the Guardian reports. "While we had hoped to reach a sale out of court, the Board is pleased to have a plan for maximizing the value of its assets, preserving as many jobs as possible, and pursuing justice for any victims," chairman Bob Weinstein said in a statement. The company's bankruptcy petition in Delaware will position Lantern Asset Management as the stalking horse bidder for Weinstein Co. assets after coming to a purchase agreement, Variety reports. "No one should be afraid to speak out or coerced to stay quiet," the company's statement said. "The Company thanks the courageous individuals who have already come forward. Your voices have inspired a movement for change across the country and around the world." New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who filed a lawsuit against the company last month on behalf of its employees, called the move "a watershed moment."

The boy's mom got the phone back, and Tesco, the UK's largest retailer, is investigating, CNET reports. The store's managers, however, say Siri may have been tricked by pranksters into thinking the boy's name was on the phone.

– New evidence suggests Danish inventor Peter Madsen tortured and murdered Swedish journalist Kim Wall during a 10-day trip on his home-made submarine. Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen told a court in Copenhagen on Tuesday that Madsen's hard drive contained video footage "which we presume to be real" showing women being strangled and decapitated, reports Reuters. Madsen, who has been charged with Wall's murder, denies killing the 30-year-old journalist, who boarded his submarine for an interview on Aug. 10. He has said she died in an accident when a hatch cover fell on her head while she was climbing on to the submarine's deck. Buch-Jepsen said Madsen's DNA was found on Wall's body and that multiple knife wounds had been inflicted "at the time of death or shortly afterward." Madsen, who appeared in court via video link from prison, said the computer police found on him wasn't his. He said he was "not the only person" with access to the computer in his workshop, and the extreme content didn't belong to him. The Guardian reports the court heard "nothing that supports Kim Wall being killed by my client." It ordered Madsen to be held for another four weeks.

– President Trump has returned to his West Palm Beach golf course on another sunny Florida day. Trump began his Friday on Twitter, saying Democrats and Republicans "MUST come together, finally, with a major Border Security package, which will include funding for the Wall." He says it's "time for action," even though the idea is opposed by many Democrats, who recently won control of the House, per the AP. Trump also calls on Congress to pass criminal justice reform legislation. He says Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer "have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country." But Trump tweeted at the wrong account, tagging a Schumer fan instead of the senator. For Thanksgiving, Trump called troops, answered reporters' questions, visited a Coast Guard station, and had dinner at his Mar-a-Lago club.

– She's described as a white woman in her 20s who stands about 5-foot-8, weighs about 120 pounds, and is suspected of robbing jewelry stores in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and North Carolina since April, NBC News reports. On Monday, she may have struck again, this time at a Jared Vault in Mebane, NC. Police say she showed up at the store with a gun, forced employees into a back room at gunpoint, and tied them up with zip-ties before making off with an undisclosed amount of jewelry. She's believed to be working with a black male suspect in his 30s or 40s who was caught on surveillance cameras in three of the robberies, according to WNCN.

– The Secret Service is investigating after one of its agents posted on Facebook that she wouldn't defend President Trump if someone tried to shoot him, the Washington Examiner reports. Kerry O'Grady, a senior agent in the Denver field office, made a series of now-deleted posts on Facebook during the election campaign in which she called Trump a "disaster" for the country and said she wouldn't honor a federal law that prevents agents like her from publicly discussing their political beliefs. "As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act. So I keep quiet and skirt the median," she wrote in one post. "To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides. But this world has changed and I have changed. And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her," she wrote. O'Grady deleted the posts shortly after they were reported by the Examiner. The Secret Service said in a statement Tuesday that it is "aware of the postings and the agency is taking quick and appropriate

– If you're worried about your health, 23andMe's Personal Genome Service might be able to help. But the FDA isn't so sure. In a warning letter sent yesterday to 23andMe CEO Ann Wojcicki, the agency warns that the company's marketing of the service, which analyzes a person's DNA to detect diseases, violates the FDA's Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because it doesn't meet the definition of a medical device. The service is "intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or function of the body," the letter reads, according to Forbes. 23andMe argues that the service is a "first step in prevention" that helps people "take steps toward mitigating serious diseases," like diabetes and breast cancer. But the FDA says it's concerned about false positives that could lead people to take steps like chemo or surgery that could increase their risk of disease. 23andMe says it's working with the FDA to address its concerns.

– The Golden State Warriors somehow withstood LeBron James' latest brilliance on the NBA Finals stage. A costly blunder by JR Smith and a disputed foul call involving James himself sure helped. Stephen Curry scored 29 points and the Warriors capitalized on Smith's mistake that sent the game into overtime, overcoming a 51-point performance by James to beat Cleveland 124-114 in Game 1 on Thursday night, per the AP. The game nearly over, James jawed with both Curry and Klay Thompson, then Tristan Thompson and Draymond Green tangled moments later and made contact. After replay review, Tristan Thompson received a Flagrant 2 foul and ejection with 2.6 seconds left. James was in utter disbelief as regulation ended stunningly: George Hill made the first of two free throws with 4.7 seconds left after being fouled by Klay Thompson, but when Smith secured the rebound of the second, he dribbled back toward halfcourt instead of shooting, apparently thinking the Cavs had a lead. "He thought it was over. He thought we were up one," coach Tyronn Lue said. Yet Smith insisted he knew the score. Green figured Smith was simply looking for James, saying, "I would have looked for LeBron, too."

– If you're trying to lose weight, you might want to think twice about drinking diet drinks containing artificial sweeteners. A new study finds no evidence that artificial sweeteners help people lose weight, and they appear to be linked to weight gain and an increased risk of diabetes and other health issues, CTV reports. "I think the takeaway for Canadians at this point is to maybe think twice about whether you really want to be consuming these artificial sweeteners, particularly on an everyday basis, because really we don’t have evidence to say for sure whether these are truly harmless alternatives to sugar," says study co-author Meghan Azad of the University of Manitoba, per the CBC. Azad and her team reviewed 37 studies that looked at the diet habits of more than 400,000 people. They found no evidence that regular consumption of artificial sweeteners helped people lose weight, only that they were associated with an increased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, and modest increases in weight and waist circumferences. Azad says the findings are surprising given how common artificial sweeteners are. "Surprisingly, given how common these products are, not many studies have looked at the long-term impact of their consumption," she says. Azad says there are many theories as to why artificial sweeteners seem to be linked to weight gain, including that they disrupt

– A man suspected of killing a Texas state trooper during a traffic stop was taken into custody more than 100 miles away, authorities said Thursday night. The Harris County Sheriff's Office announced on Twitter that the suspect was apprehended in neighboring Waller County. The Texas Department of Public Safety and other law enforcement agencies had identified the suspect as Dabrett Black, 32, of Linsdale, Texas, the AP reports. DPS said the trooper was shot and killed before 4pm Thursday during a traffic stop on Interstate 45 near Fairfield, about 90 miles south of Dallas. The trooper was shot with a rifle and died at the scene, the agency said. The suspect then fled. Hours after the shooting, the Waller County Sheriff's Office said the suspect's vehicle was spotted in Hempstead, about 110 miles south of Fairfield. The sheriff's office said on its Facebook page that shots were fired, but did not indicate who opened fire. The suspect was apprehended a short time later.

– Daivon Reeder's stepdad told him it was "pointless" to go to orientation at Eastern Michigan University. Four years later, the 22-year-old Detroit man is set to graduate with a major in criminal justice and a minor in military science, the Detroit Free Press reports. "I looked at the picture and the emoji of me laughing I thought that was an ironic situation—we are in two different situations in our lives," Reeder tells Fox 2 Detroit. "Look what you said and look where you are at." Reeder, who is the first in his family to go to college, tells Fox 2 he lost a scholarship when he was 18 and had to go to basic training for the Army. He worked two jobs to support his family and formed an organization to mentor young boys. "Living our values—live, learn, teach, knowing I was living life making mistakes," he says.

– If you're in the market for a new baby name, you may want to check out Baby Name Report Card, a book by Albert Mehrabian published in 1997 that offers up recommendations based on more than a decade's worth of research. The book's mission: "to provide scientifically-based information for choosing baby names," Mehrabian says in a press release. His recommendations, according to the book's website, include those that "will impart positive and beneficial, rather than negative and harmful, impressions to others"; names that "will be assets rather than liabilities throughout a lifetime"; and names that "describe a popular-fun person, or its opposite." Some of Mehrabian's suggestions: Top names: Those with " desirable or attractive" names tend to be treated more favorably than those with "undesirable or unattractive" names, according to Mehrabian's research. Top names for girls: Those with " femininity" names tend to be treated more favorably than those with "generally attractive" names. Top names for boys: Those with "popular-fun" names tend to be treated more favorably than those with "evil" names.

– Al Gore has been out of the public eye since losing the popular vote and the White House to George W. Bush in 2000. But that doesn't mean there aren't whispers that he's thinking about running for president again. A senior Democrat tells BuzzFeed that supporters of Gore "have begun a round of conversations among themselves and with the former vice president about his running for president in 2016, the latest sign that top Democrats have serious doubts that Hillary Clinton is a sure thing." "They're figuring out if there's a path financially and politically," the Democrat says. "It feels more real than it has in the past months." A member of Gore's inner circle, however, tells BuzzFeed that "this is people talking to people, some of whom may or may not have talked to him." A Gore spokeswoman tells Politico that "there's no truth to it. He's laser-focused on solving the climate crisis."

– An explosion at Iran's Fordow nuclear site last week was "Western propaganda ahead of nuclear negotiations to influence their process and outcome," an Iranian military commander said yesterday, denying reports that the site had been damaged. Israel, meanwhile, says it has no evidence of an explosion at the site, which is 300 feet underground and has 2,700 centrifuges that enrich uranium to more than 20% purity, the Telegraph reports. Tehran has accused Israel of trying to sabotage its nuclear program, which it says is entirely peaceful. "Israel would do anything within its power to stop the Iranian nuclear program. This includes tactics that fall just short of, or substitute, a direct attack, such as the cyber war that has been raging for the past few years or acts of sabotage on Iran's nuclear facilities," an Israeli official said.

– Facebook is turning 10 today, and to mark the occasion, Will Oremus at Slate takes a look back at what the site looked like a year after its Feb. 4, 2004 launch. Among the highlights: The site had just 1 million users by December, and no photo-upload feature had yet been added. News Feed had just been introduced. Beacon, the site's short-lived experiment with democracy, had just been added. Facebook has grown to more than 500 million users, and last year it made a $1.5 billion profit. But it hasn't turned a profit in more than a decade. Zuckerberg predicted in a 2004 interview with the Harvard student newspaper that he would "eventually make something profitable," and it took him a while, but Facebook did so in 2009 and last year, racking up a profit of $1.5 billion and $8 billion, respectively. The Facebook 10th birthday timeline is here.

– Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan Saturday to expand funding for community health care centers, a move that could open the door to Bernie Sanders' endorsement, USA Today reports. "The proposal brought forth today by Secretary Clinton, working with our campaign, is an important step forward in expanding healthcare in America—and expanding health insurance and healthcare access to tens of millions of Americans," Sanders said in a statement. "I congratulate Secretary Clinton for this extremely important initiative." Clinton's proposal would double funding for community health care centers, which serve populations with limited access to health care. Community health care centers have been a key priority for Sanders, I-Vt., who successfully fought for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for such centers in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Clinton also reaffirmed her commitment to giving Americans in every state the choice of a "public-option" insurance plan, per Reuters. Clinton's plan would increase mandatory health-care funding by $40 billion over the next decade.

"People don't realize how tough it is to come from nothing when you don't have any family or any friends." Hagenston, who goes by the name "Honest Abe," has been homeless for 10 years and panhandles in Detroit's Woodward Square every day, accepting credit and debit cards with a reader attached to his cell phone, CBS Detroit reports. "I'm only homeless guy in America who can take a credit card," he says. "It's safe and secure." He says he and a group of fellow homeless have organized themselves "like a union" to panhandle in shifts and he has figured out a way to make donations more efficient. "I take VISA, MasterCard, American Express," Hagenston says. "I'm only homeless guy in America who can take a credit card." He says that without the extra cash, he hasn't made enough money this winter to buy new eyeglasses and a new prescription, and he could use a new prescription. He also has a website where people can donate to a collection of homeless people or report fake panhandlers. "I'm trying to

– Police have arrested a man accused of stealing a teenager's "Make America Great Again" hat and throwing a drink in his face at a Whataburger in Texas, the AP reports. In a video posted to Facebook Wednesday, the man can be seen taking off the hat from 16-year-old Hunter Richard and walking away from a group of teens. In a statement, Whataburger says it was "shocked to see this video and certainly don't condone this type of customer behavior in our restaurants." The San Antonio Police Department says 30-year-old Kino Jimenez was arrested at his home Thursday and charged with theft. The teenager's mother, Patricia Spittler, posted the video to Facebook asking for help identifying the "scum bag of the year." She says Jimenez approached a group of teens "minding their own business just having a burger." "It would be nice to know who he is for someone to let him know his actions are not okay! Real tough guy ... approaches a group of teenagers minding their own business just having a burger! He kept his hat, too," she wrote in the video. Business Insider reports that Richard posted a photo on Instagram showing him in the MAGA hat.

– At least 13 people, including children, died after a boat carrying tourists capsized and sank on a lake during a thunderstorm in a country music mecca in southwest Missouri, authorities said Friday. Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Jason Pace said four people remain missing Friday after the Ride the Ducks boat sank on Table Rock Lake in Branson Thursday evening. He said 14 people survived, and that seven of them were injured. Patrol divers found two more bodies early Friday, raising the death toll from 11 to 13, Pace said. A spokeswoman for the Cox Medical Center Branson said four adults and three children arrived at the hospital shortly after the incident. Two adults are in critical condition and the others were treated for minor injuries, Brandei Clifton said. Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader said five people remain missing and seven others were hospitalized after a Ride the Ducks boat sank on Table Rock Lake in Branson. A spokeswoman for the Cox Medical Center Branson said four adults and three children arrived at the hospital shortly after the incident. Rader said the stormy weather was believed to be the cause of the capsizing.

– President Obama's news conference today laid out his position on the Bush tax cuts, and it was a doozy, writes Ezra Klein in the Washington Post: "If we choose to keep those tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, if we keep the tax break for corporate jet owners, if we choose to keep tax breaks for oil and gas companies that are making hundreds of billions of dollars, then that means we’ve got to cut some kids off from getting a college scholarship. That means we’ve got to stop funding certain grants for medical research. That means that food safety may be compromised. That means that Medicare has to bear a greater part of the burden." "The primary goal of President Obama’s presser, which just wrapped up, was obvious: He was clearly out to pick a major public fight with Republicans over tax cuts for the rich," writes Paul Krugman in the New York Times. Obama mounted a surprisingly aggressive moral case for ending high-end tax cuts, casting it as a test of our society’s priorities, and argued— crucially—that anyone who fails to support ending them is fundamentally unserious about the deficit. He also went out of his way to highlight GOP opposition to raising revenues by ending a perk for corporate jet owners. This proposal

– Phillip Boyle and Jamie Blyth, two Brits who went out for a few drinks on Friday night, woke up on a plane in Abu Dhabi the next day, where they spent the next 14 hours or so. "We were a bit confused in Abu Dhabi at the stop over but just thought, 'We’re here now so we should just make the most of it,'" Blyth tells the Northern Echo. "No one’s misbehaved," Boyle adds, per the Daily Mail. The group then decided to take two seven-hour flights to Pattaya, Thailand. "It's a last minute bad idea—but one of those bad ideas that turns into a good idea," Boyle says. "I nearly canceled when [we were] on the way to Manchester Airport and realized this is all a bit rash and nothing was booked. But they followed their best (worst?) instincts and bought tickets to Pattaya, Thailand, two seven-hour flights interrupted by a layover in Abu Dhabi. Boyle says he didn't even pack a real suitcase, he just stuffed some t-shirts and some clean underwear in a grocery bag. After 14 hours and 6,750 miles, the group landed in the beachside city, where they planned to stay until Tuesday. "It's

According to CNN, the suspect holds dual American-Israeli citizenship. He was arrested in southern Israel after an undercover FBI agent posing as a potential recruit placed a call to a Jewish community center in the city of Ashkelon. Police say the suspect used "advanced camouflage technologies" to hide his identity. The threats were made against more than 100 Jewish institutions in the US, Australia, and New Zealand, forcing the evacuations of dozens of centers. The FBI confirmed the arrest and said it could not provide further information.

– A federal judge's ruling that the Obama health law is unconstitutional has landed like a stink bomb among Republicans, who've seen the politics of health care flip as Americans increasingly value the overhaul's core parts, including protections for pre-existing medical conditions and Medicaid for more low-income people. While the decision by the Republican-appointed judge in Texas was sweeping, it has little immediate practical impact because the Affordable Care Act remains in place while the legal battle continues, possibly to the Supreme Court, the AP reports. HealthCare.gov, the government's site for signing up, was taking applications Saturday, the deadline in most states for enrolling for coverage next year, and those benefits will take effect as scheduled Jan. 1. Medicaid expansion will proceed in Virginia, one of the latest states to accept that option. Employers will still be required to cover the young adult children of workers, and Medicare recipients will still get discounted prescription drugs. But Republicans, still stinging from their loss of the House in the midterm elections, are facing a fresh political quandary after US District Judge Reed O'Connor said the entire 2010 health law was invalid. Warnings about the Texas lawsuit were part of the political narrative behind Democrats' electoral gains. Health care was the top issue for about one-fourth

– Ireland's parliament has passed a bill that will allow abortion in cases of rape, incest, and to save the mother's life—but only if the woman's life is in danger. The bill, passed by a vote of 127 to 31, does not, however, allow abortions for women who are the subject of rape or incest, or who are at risk of suicide, the Guardian reports. Catholic cardinals and bishops had threatened to excommunicate Prime Minister Enda Kenny if he didn't pass the " Protection of Life in Pregnancy Bill," but he did so anyway. Abortion is already legal in Ireland in cases of rape, when the mother's life is in danger, or incest, the AP reports. The new law also does not allow abortions for women who are the subject of rape, who are under 18, or who are suicidal. Some 4,000 Irish women traveled to Britain for abortions last year, including 124 under 18.

– A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and olive oil may help you live longer, according to a new study. Researchers found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with longer telomeres, which protect the ends of our chromosomes from cell division, the BBC reports. Telomere length has been linked to a wide range of age-related diseases, including heart disease and cancer. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, followed nearly 5,000 women over more than a decade. Researchers found that those who largely stuck to the Mediterranean diet had longer telomeres. "Our results further support the benefits of adherence to the Mediterranean diet for promoting health and longevity," the study's lead author says in a press release. The diet was not the only dietary component associated with longer telomeres. Fruits, vegetables, and nuts were also associated with longer telomeres. Researchers aren't saying the Mediterranean diet is responsible for the long lives. " Telomere length is considered to be a biomarker of aging," the lead researcher says. "Given that fruits, vegetables, and nuts, key components of the Mediterranean diet, have well known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, we hypothesized that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet would be associated with longer telomere length."

– A seriously ill woman in El Salvador has had a successful cesarean section to deliver a baby that doctors have given little chance of surviving. The 22-year-old woman, known only as Beatriz, underwent the operation in the afternoon after 27 weeks of pregnancy, the ministry said. Her baby girl was born without a brain. "No one can say how long she will live," Morena Herrera of the Feminist Collective for Local Development told the AP. "It was painful to see the little creature. That's what the grandmother told us, and the doctors confirmed it." The country's Supreme Court last week prohibited an abortion for Beatriz, who suffers from lupus and kidney failure and whose lawyers said the pregnancy was threatening her life. Her plight drew international attention and a ruling from the Inter-American Court on Human Rights that El Salvador should protect her life and help her end the pregnancy. The Health Ministry stepped in late last week after the ruling and said it would allow the C-section because the pregnancy was already at 26 weeks and the country's strict abortion laws were no longer at play. El Salvador has some of the toughest abortion laws in Latin America, along with Chile, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Suriname.

– Tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi clashed in Cairo yesterday, leaving at least one Muslim Brotherhood supporter dead and more than 120 injured in what the Wall Street Journal calls the "largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the country's revolution early last year." The clashes broke out after pro-Morsi supporters tore down tents at a protest outside the presidential palace, reports the Los Angeles Times. Morsi's opponents had camped out outside the palace for two days to protest a draft constitution that Morsi has quickly put to a national referendum. The Brotherhood called on members to march on the protesters, and thousands of them did just that, hurling rocks, Molotov cocktails, and firebombs, reports the New York Times. Mohamed ElBaradei tweeted: "Vicious attack vs. peaceful protesters in front of presidential palace.Regime leading Egypt into violence and bloodshed."

– Ebola kills between 10% and 80% of people who contract the virus, with symptoms including fever, bleeding, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing problems, and difficulty swallowing, Gizmodo reports. But a new study published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases shows that up to 25% of people who contract the virus don't show any of the typical symptoms—meaning they're asymptomatic, or their symptoms are relatively mild and not wholly reflective of how the virus affects most people. In other words, they have "minimally symptomatic infections." Gene Richardson and his team tested 187 men, women, and children in the village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone for Ebola after they were exposed to the virus either because they lived in the same household or shared a public toilet with a person known to have had the disease. Of these, 14 were found to have an antibody to Ebola and two recalled having a fever at the time of the outbreak. The researchers aren't sure if an asymptomatic person with Ebola can transmit the virus. "They were not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhea," Richardson says in a statement. "It's unclear if they can pass it along it sexually." More research is needed to determine if Ebola can be spread by a person who shows

"Republican governors in this country have stood up and done things, not just talked about them," he said, praising the work of governors like Wisconsin's Scott Walker and Ohio's John Kasich. But he also warned the crowd that the GOP has lost its way by nominating candidates too conservative, reports Politico. "We don’t get to govern if we don’t win," he said.

– Donald Trump held a closed-door meeting with black pastors on Monday, and the results were not pretty. Politico reports that the pastors—who were supposed to endorse Trump at a press conference—instead demanded an apology for his rhetoric toward racial minorities. "Our community really wants him to be sensitive with the way he handles people and they feel he's insensitive," says Bishop Orrin Pullings, a Virginia-based pastor. "We told him that you are insensitive in appearance to our community and that's not a good position. He listened to us and you know, I think Donald Trump is a very good listener." Trump, however, says the pastors didn't ask him to tone down his rhetoric. "The tone has taken me to first position in every single poll," he tells Politico. "The beautiful thing about the meeting is they didn't ask me to change the tone." According to pullings, there was also disagreement at the meeting about whether Trump should apologize to Mexicans for his rhetoric. "Another crowd said, 'No, you should never apologize. You're ahead in the polls now because of your big mouth,'" says Pullings. "You start apologizing, you've got to keep apologizing." Trump says the meeting was

– A woman on a remote Brazilian island has given birth there for the first time in 12 years, the BBC reports. Fernando de Noronha island, which has around 3,000 residents but no maternity ward, has strict population controls because of its vulnerability to natural disasters. Expectant mothers are asked to travel to the mainland city of Natal, 227 miles away. On Saturday, a woman believed to be 22 gave birth at home. "On Friday night I had pains and when I went to the bathroom I saw something coming down between my legs," she tells O Globo, per the Guardian. "That's when the child's father came and picked it up. It was a baby, a girl. I was dumbstruck."

– There's a new enemy in town, and it's a pretty big one: giant hogweed. The plant is native to the Great Lakes and can grow to more than a foot in height, making it the biggest invasive plant in North America, reports the CBC. And it's causing a lot of problems in Michigan, with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources noting more than half of the state's counties have at least one giant hogweed problem. "It's devastating," one county commissioner tells the Detroit Free Press. "I've never seen anything like it in my life." The biggest problem is in counties north of Detroit, where the invasive plant has caused significant damage to crops and watersheds, according to the DNR. The best way to get rid of the plant is to cut it off before it gets too big, but that can take years. In Michigan, the best method is to cut it off at the root level, then remove the flower heads and seed heads before the plants regrow, the DNR says. Another option is to dig up the soil and cover it with topsoil.

– A 37-year-old American citizen has been recaptured 16 years after escaping from a Texas prison. Juan Salaz was captured in Mexico and is awaiting extradition to the US to finish serving his sentence on charges of attempted capital murder of a police officer, reports the AP. Salaz escaped the night of March 22, 1997, from the Garza East prison in Beeville by climbing over three 16-foot fences all topped with razor wire. At the time, he was serving three concurrent 35-year sentences for aggravated kidnapping with a deadly weapon and two counts of attempted capital murder of a police officer for a 1995 incident involving two Houston officers. Prison officials said sources for years had told them Salaz was hiding out in Mexico but he managed to evade police. The hunt for him involved the US Marshals Service, the Texas prison system's Office of Inspector General, and Mexican law enforcement agencies. "Salaz thought that he had eluded authorities by starting a new life in Mexico," said the inspector general. "He was wrong." Salaz is to be returned to Texas custody once the Mexican government approves his extradition.

– Tony Trapani, 81, was cleaning out his wife's filing cabinet after her death when he found a letter that had been hiding in there for more than 50 years. In it, the mother of a son Trapani never met wrote, "I have a little boy. He is five years old now. What I'm trying to say Tony is he is your son." Samuel Childress, 61, who grew up in Pennsylvania and assumed Trapani ignored the letter, finally met his father for the first time last week in Grand Rapids, Mich., Fox 17 reports. "I always asked my mom, I said, 'Well what does he look like?' She said, 'Well, go look in the mirror,'" Childress says. "Just to know him now is so important to me. It's going to fill that void." Trapani tells the New York Daily News that he doesn't know why his wife didn't tell him about the letter. "She wanted children. She couldn't have any. She tried and tried," he says. "He's my full son that I've had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me."

– A Facebook board member and prominent Silicon Valley investor has apologized for apparently supporting "Internet colonialism" in India after the country banned Facebook's Internet access program, the Wall Street Journal reports. On Tuesday, Marc Andreessen tweeted about the "morally wrong" decision by India's telecom regulator to ban Facebook's "Free Basics" Internet access program. "Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?" Andreessen tweeted, according to Quartz. He later deleted those tweets and apologized for them "in full and without reservation." Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg quickly distanced himself from Andreessen's comments. "I found the comments deeply upsetting, and they do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all," Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook. "We strongly reject the sentiments expressed by Marc Andreessen last night regarding India."

– If you're going to get engaged on Facebook, you might want to make sure it's in the first picture you post. Miranda Levy did just that when she shared a photo of herself and her fiance with the caption, "I'm happy regardless of material things," the Independent reports. But her friends were more interested in what was in the bottom left corner of the photo: a pregnancy test. So she posted, "Hey we're having a baby, too," according to KFOR.

– Ron Paul's declaration that "we are all Austrians now" has led to a lot of confusion. The term "Austrian economics" has a double meaning, writes Matthew Yglesias at Slate, because it refers to the thinking of Ludwig von Mises and his student Murray Rothbard. They're "a form of capitalism that is even more libertarian and anarchic than that espoused by many libertarians," Yglesias writes. Austrians believe that every economic policy pursued by the federal government and Federal Reserve is a mistake that distorts markets. They argue that artificially low interest rates spur "malinvestment" in enterprises that inevitably crash when the stimulus is withdrawn. "This is an emotionally appealing idea, positing that the suffering of a bust is a kind of cosmic payback for the boom," writes Yglesias. "But it doesn’t make much logical sense. For one thing, as George Mason University economist Bryan Caplan, who’s ideologically sympathetic to the Austrians, points out, it’s hard to understand why businesspeople would be so easily duped in this way."

– President Obama's decision to accept the resignation of acting IRS chief Steven Miller and to appoint a new acting commissioner may seem like a quick fix, but it's not enough to save his second-term agenda, writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. Republicans, he writes, are "going to remain on the attack—and they’re upping their demands." Still, Democrats say the White House has "found the footing" after days of anxiety, and they're happy that yesterday's moves helped. "Our goal since Monday night when the AP revelation poured accelerant on the fire has been to tackle each of the three issues separately but forcefully and get back on offense as soon as possible," an Obama aide tells Politico. "That wasn’t possible on Tuesday because we didn’t have the IG report and would not have been able to take decisive action at the IRS and we needed to get the emails declassified, which took time and pushed us into Wednesday."

– Two months after 43 students disappeared in the southern city of Iguala, allegedly killed and burned by a drug gang working with local police, Mexico's President Enrique Pe ⁇ a Nieto announced an anti-crime plan that would give state authorities control over often-corrupt municipal police and dissolve local governments infiltrated by drug gangs, the AP reports. The president's plan would also relax the complex divisions between which offenses are dealt with at federal, state, and local levels. At present, some local police refuse to act to prevent federal crimes like drug trafficking. The plan would focus first on four of Mexico's most troubled states— Guerrero, Michoacan, Jalisco, and Tamaulipas. More federal police and other security forces would be sent to the "hot land" region overlapping the first two states, where the government has already sent significant contingents of federal police and soldiers. "My response to the police operation in the 'hot lands' is: 'What? Another one?'" said Mexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope, alluding to a string of previous anti-crime initiatives in the area. "The same as the others, for a limited time and without the right conditions?"

– Boston's New England Holocaust Memorial was vandalized for the second time this summer, just two days after a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. Police say a 17-year-old threw a rock Monday evening through one of the glass panels at the memorial, which bears the numbers that Nazis tattooed on concentration camp victims, the Boston Globe reports. The male teen was tackled by two bystanders and held until police arrived. He is charged with willful destruction of property, and police are investigating whether the incident was a hate crime. The vandalism, which happened just before 7pm, came just two days after a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. turned violent, and less than two months after a 21-year-old with a history of mental illness shattered a glass panel at the Boston memorial. The glass towers of the memorial, which was installed in 1995, had never been vandalized before the June incident. "It's a reminder that we as a community need to be united, both in our opposition to all forms of hate but also in the important role that memorials play in our community," Robert Trestan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, tells the Globe.

– Jonathan Pollard, who was sentenced to life in prison in 1987 for spying for Israel, will be released on parole Nov. 21, his lawyer announced Tuesday. The New York Times reports the 60-year-old will leave federal prison in Butner, NC, just before Thanksgiving. Pollard's lawyer, Jacques Semmelman, calls it a "miracle" and says he's "thrilled and grateful." According to CNN, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pushing for Pollard's release for years. The White House says it won't challenge the parole decision.

– Scott Weiland's ex-wife wants to be named the executor of the late Stone Temple Pilots frontman's will. Mary Forsberg, who was his second wife from 1994 to 2000 and has two children with his first wife, Janina Castenada, filed court documents on Dec. 30 asking to be named the executor of the will, which was written in April 2007, People reports. Weiland, who was found dead in a Bloomington, Minn., hotel room in December at age 48, had about $2 million to his estate and also created a trust with undisclosed assets. His widow, Jamie Wachtel, who was with Weiland for two years before his death, could still contest Forsberg's filing, TMZ reports.

– The Senate has sent the House a short-term spending bill that will keep the government funded—but not defund ObamaCare. The bill, which funds the government through Oct. 1, passed the Senate 68-31, with all Democrats voting in favor. The bill now goes to the House, but John Boehner says he won't bring it to the floor because it doesn't defund ObamaCare, reports the Hill. "The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want the train wreck that is ObamaCare," he said. But the Tea Party Patriots aren't buying it. "If he chooses to side with Barack Obama and with the Democrats in order to fund ObamaCare, then he owns ObamaCare and he can’t get out of that," said Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin. "He’ll be as responsible for ObamaCare as Harry Reid," she added, calling for Boehner's resignation. The Senate bill, however, doesn't include language defunding ObamaCare or prioritizing debt payments in the event of a default, notes the Washington Post.

– "We stood there crying—filming with tears rolling down our cheeks." That's how nature photographer Paul Nicklen describes a video he recently posted to social media showing a starving polar bear on its deathbed in the Canadian Arctic, National Geographic reports. "This is what a starving bear looks like," says Nicklen, who was on a trip with the conservation group Sea Legacy. "When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like. Bears are going to starve to death," he says. "This is what a starving bear looks like." The video was shot in late summer on Somerset Island, near the larger Baffin Island, and shows the bear rummaging through a garbage can used by Inuit fishers in search of food. It's unclear why the bear was starving, but Nicklen says he didn't want to prolong its misery. "It's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat," he says. Nicklen says he's been asked why he didn't try to rescue the bear, but he says feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada. "When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like," he says.

– David Petraeus' affair with Jill Kelley may have gotten him in trouble with the feds, but don't expect to see him go to prison. Federal prosecutors have recommended that he be charged with mishandling classified information, reports NBC News. No charges have been filed yet, and it's up to Eric Holder to decide whether the facts of the case merit a court appearance. The New York Times, which first reported the recommendation, notes that investigators concluded that Petraeus' affair amounted to a "significant security breach in the office of one of the nation’s most trusted intelligence leaders."

"Should we give birth or have an abortion?" has 46% of the vote at Birthornot.com at the moment, with "Have an abortion" at 54%. Alisha and Pete Arnold, both 30, say they'll use the results to make a decision before Alisha's 20th week of pregnancy ends. "It's kind of like Congress. They might vote for something, but the president has the final veto," Pete tells Gawker. "If it's overwhelming one way or the other, that will carry a lot more weight."

– Sherri Papini has been reunited with her family, three weeks after the California woman disappeared after going for a jog. Sheila Koester, the sister of the 34-year-old, tells the Sacramento Bee that Papini and her husband, Keith, have been reunited. "What I can say is that her and Keith have been reunited," Koester says. "And that they are very happy to be together and they're very thankful for everyone for allowing them to have their privacy and allowing them to recover from their situation that all of us have been in." Police say Papini was found early Thanksgiving morning on the side of Interstate 5 in Yolo County, about 30 miles from where she disappeared on Nov. 2. They say she was bound with restraints when she was let out of a SUV. "Sherri is now safe," Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said at a press conference Thursday, per the Los Angeles Times. Police have released few details about Papini's ordeal, other than to say she was injured during the abduction and released from a hospital. They are searching for two women armed with a handgun.

– Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan Monday to tighten gun laws, including expanding background checks and revoking the licenses of gun dealers who knowingly supply "straw purchasers," the New York Times reports. According to Vox, Clinton's plan includes closing loopholes in the background check system and repealing a law that protects gun manufacturers from liability for gun violence. But the most controversial aspect of Clinton's plan is an executive action she plans to take to close the loophole that allows private sellers to sell guns without conducting background checks if Congress doesn't. Clinton's campaign says this could theoretically be accomplished via a new rule by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that would more clearly define what it means to be "engaged in the business" of selling firearms. Gun control advocates point out that under federal law, those "engaged in the business" of selling firearms must perform background checks, but federal regulations defining that phrase are too vague, allowing too many gun sales to proceed without such a check. Such federal regs, they say, could be changed through executive action that, for example, would set a clearer threshold defining "engaged in the business" of selling firearms in terms of the number of guns sold. Arkadi Gerney, a gun policy expert at the Center for American Progress, tells Vox

– When the St. Roch set sail from Vancouver, BC, in 1793, it was the first ship to traverse the Northwest Passage and the Panama Canal. Today, it's part of the Great Maritime Museum's exhibit on the ship and its role in Canadian maritime history, reports the CBC. The ship itself isn't too impressive—it's got just a few crew quarters, including a cabin where an Inuit family lived while the St. Roch was being repaired, says the museum's website—but it's pretty cool. "The ship inside is very cool to climb around and explore. It's crazy to me that an Inuit family lived on deck to help the sailors while on an expedition," one visitor writes on TripAdvisor. "The museum as a whole is pretty old—it's nothing fancy and new. It's not too bad, though. The bathrooms were clean and the people working the front desk were helpful in calling us a taxi to get back downtown. We took a taxi there and he went to the wrong location at first- guess it's not as common a destination as I thought. He didn't charge us for the mistake though and it ended up being a pretty cheap ride."

– A hole in the roof of a Southwest Airlines plane forced it to make an emergency landing yesterday, but no one was seriously injured when the 15-year-old Boeing 737-300 plummeted from 38,000 feet to 15,000 feet over Arizona. The airline has grounded 80 of its Boeing 737-300s so that they can be inspected, and it's not clear how many flights will be canceled today, the AP reports. Flight attendants had just begun to take drink orders when the explosion rocked the cabin, according to passenger Christine Ziegler. "The first officer said, 'Hey, there's a hole in the cabin,'" Ziegler tells the Los Angeles Times. "And he said, 'It's not a hole, it's a part of the fuselage.'"

– Michigan's attorney general filed criminal charges Friday against Gov. Rick Snyder and four other officials over the Flint water crisis, the Detroit Free Press reports. According to the Detroit News, the charges include official misconduct, evidence tampering, and neglect of duty. The charges are the first levied in a probe that has so far resulted in the involuntary manslaughter of five city and state officials and the recall of 10 people who worked in Snyder's administration. The charges are related to the city's tap water, which was found to be contaminated with lead after it was switched from the Detroit system to the Flint River in 2014 to save money. Prosecutors say there was a "willful, intentional, unethical, and fraudulent" effort to mislead the public about the crisis, the Detroit News reports. Snyder says he has "full confidence" in the investigation by Attorney General Bill Schuette, the Detroit News reports. According to the Free Press, Snyder says he plans to meet with the mayor and other city and state officials to discuss a deal that would get Flint's water treated by the state before it's used for residential use.

– The Pentagon has made contingency plans to send special operations troops to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles if President Obama decides it's time to intervene, senior US officials tell the Los Angeles Times. The plan would likely involve stealthy raids by special operations teams and airstrikes to destroy the chemicals without dispersing them in the air, the officials say. US satellites and drone aircraft already maintain partial surveillance of the sites, the officials say. Experts say the chemical agents are stored in bunkers and other sites around the country. Four production facilities are near the cities of Aleppo, Hama, and Homs, all tinderboxes in the 17-month uprising, as well as the coastal city of Latakia, an area considered a stronghold for Assad's Alawite religious sect. An unclassified report by the director of national intelligence this year said Syria's chemical agents "can be delivered by aerial bombs, ballistic missiles, and artillery rockets." But Syrian rockets, including Scud missiles procured from North Korea, are notoriously inaccurate, making them ineffective for delivering a heavy concentration of toxic chemicals to a specific target. "The actual killing may be less important than the panic they would induce," said Leonard Spector, who heads the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies.

– Super PACs may have cost Newt Gingrich the Iowa caucuses, but they didn't cost him the Supreme Court case that opened the door to super PACs in the first place, reports the Christian Science Monitor. Gingrich still supports the court decision, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, but he says he's not the victim of the decision. "I'm the victim of one particular person, Mitt Romney, whose staff went out and decided to run a deliberately negative and dishonest campaign," he said. Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig, meanwhile, tells Democracy Now that he, too, supports the decision. "I think it's a great victory for free speech," he said. "It has nothing to do with the Citizens United case, it has to do with the floodgates for the unlimited campaign money that fueled them."
