– If you're going to eat meat, you might want to make sure it's free of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. That's the message from a new federal law that went into effect last week, the Los Angeles Times reports. Specifically, the law requires meat producers to test their products for Campylobacter and salmonella, which are both "resistant to not less than two critically important antibiotics" as specified in the World Health Organization's list of "critically important antimicrobials." The law was signed by President Obama, and the Center for Science in the Public Interest calls it "one of the most sweeping food safety reforms in decades." The Center for Science in the Public Interest describes the law as "one of the most sweeping food safety reforms in decades" and says it will help stop the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food.

– President Obama's budget proposal for fiscal year 2016 is out, and he's not happy about it, the Hill reports. In a letter to Chuck Schumer, Obama said he was "troubled" by the "arbitrary and unconstitutional" process by which the House and Senate have weighed in on his plan, and he called on them to "rescind all or part of any item of budget authority provided in the [appropriation bill]." Specifically, he wants to eliminate funding for the EPA's air pollution control program, the National Institutes of Health's cancer research program, and a host of other programs that he says are "critical to our nation's long-term fiscal health." Obama also wants to eliminate funding for the Department of Homeland Security's border security program, the National Institutes of Health's cancer research program, and a host of other programs that he says aren't necessary to keep the US safe. The Hill notes that Obama's budget request for the current fiscal year is $5.3 trillion, which is $179 billion less than what was requested by Congress in the 2016 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, and $179 billion less than what was requested by Congress in the 2017 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.

– If you're an employee of one of the nation's largest employers and you've got a pre-existing condition, you may have a hard time getting health insurance. If you're an employee of one of the nation's largest employers and you've got a pre-existing condition, you may have a hard time getting health insurance. That's because, according to a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of more than 50,000 current and former employees of UnitedHealth Group, Inc., "virtually all" of those employees have pre-existing conditions that make it nearly impossible for them to get health insurance, the New York Times reports. The lawsuit, which accuses UnitedHealth of scheming to drive down costs by jacking up co-pays and deductibles, was filed on behalf of current and former employees who were enrolled in the company's "Cadillac" plan, which is part of the Affordable Care Act. According to the suit, UnitedHealth members who had pre-existing conditions were charged higher co-pays and deductibles than those who didn't, and those co-pays and deductibles were often more than the cost of their insurance. The suit alleges that UnitedHealth violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and

– As part of President Obama's plan to reduce carbon emissions, the EPA has issued new rules designed to curb the release of greenhouse gases from cars and light trucks. The rules, which go into effect in March, will require automakers to meet stricter standards for carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, the New York Times reports. The EPA estimates that the rules will cut carbon dioxide emissions by 3 gigatonnes a year by the year 2030, compared to 2005 levels, the Wall Street Journal reports. The agency says the new standards will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 3 gigatonnes a year from 2012 levels. The rule is "an important step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels," the EPA's top official said in a statement. An industry trade group called the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity said it was "deeply concerned" by the rules.

– The US National Academy of Space is set to open its doors in 2017, but the first class of students won't arrive until 2018. That's because President Trump has signed an executive order banning US citizens and legal permanent residents from taking the National Academy of Space's entrance exam, the New York Times reports. "The president has made it clear that he will not sign any legislation that impedes the National Academy of Space's mission of preparing Americans for space-related careers," the Academy's director said in a statement, adding that Trump's executive order "will have no impact on the National Academy of Space's operations." The National Academy of Space, which will be located in Colorado Springs, Colo., is intended to train people for space-related jobs in the US and around the world, according to its website. Students must be at least 18 and have a 3.2 GPA or higher.

– President Obama wants to make it easier for US companies to sell their products overseas, and he's putting his money where his mouth is. The president today signed an executive order designed to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products to foreign markets, the New York Times reports. "It's time to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products to foreign markets," Obama said in announcing the move. "And it's time to make it easier for American companies to sell their products to foreign markets." Obama's order creates the Office of the President's Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, a 21-member panel that will make recommendations to the president on how to boost US exports. The White House says the committee will make recommendations to the president on how to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products to foreign markets, as well as on how to make it easier for US companies to sell their products to foreign markets.

– More than 6 million Medicare and Medicaid dual eligibles—those who receive both benefits at the same time—will soon have a harder time getting their hands on the drugs they need, the Wall Street Journal reports. That's because, under a new law set to go into effect Jan. 1, insurers will be required to cover the drugs for these people for six months instead of the standard six months. "It's going to be a nightmare," says Sen. Bernie Sanders, who introduced the bipartisan bill in the Senate last week. "They're going to have to go to the emergency room, they're going to have to go to the hospital, they're going to have to go to nursing homes, and they're going to have serious health consequences if they don't have access to the drugs they need." The law will also make it easier for these people to sign up for a private drug plan instead of the Medicaid plan.

– If you're over the age of 65 and have hearing loss, you may be eligible for Social Security benefits. But if you don't, you may not be able to afford hearing aids at all. That's according to a new rule that went into effect last week, the Washington Post reports. It's part of a larger effort by the Social Security Administration to make it easier for people who've had hearing loss to receive benefits. The rule, which applies to anyone who has had hearing loss for at least three years and has had a "comprehensive audiologic assessment," requires doctors to check to see if a new hearing aid is needed, as well as to determine whether other services are needed, such as testing, NPR reports. The rule was put in place as part of a push by the Social Security Administration and other agencies to make it easier for people who've had hearing loss to receive benefits, NPR notes.

– A police officer in St. Louis, Mo., shot and killed unarmed black man DeRay Mckesson last year, and now Mckesson is suing the city, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. According to the suit, police violated Mckesson's civil rights when they used a Taser on him after he took off his own shirt during a struggle. The suit claims police violated Mckesson's constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, as well as his right to due process, when they used the Taser on him after he took off his own shirt to show he wasn't resisting arrest. The suit also claims police violated Mckesson's rights to due process and equal protection when they used the Taser on him after he took off his own shirt to show he wasn't resisting arrest. It's not the first time a police officer in St. Louis has been shot and killed while on duty. In fact, the Post-Dispatch reports it's the first time a police officer in St. Louis has been shot and killed while on duty. The officer in this case was off-duty and working a security job when he was shot and killed. The Post-Dispatch reports it's unclear if the officer was

– A former employee of the Savannah River Site in Georgia is suing the federal government, claiming he was fired because he raised concerns about the site's security, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The man, identified in court documents as Michael L. Carter Jr., says he was fired from his $90,000-a-year job as a project manager at the site, which includes a spent-fuel storage facility, after he raised concerns about the security of the site with superiors at the Department of Energy and the Department of Energy's inspector general, the Journal-Constitution notes. "I was fired for raising concerns about the security of the Savannah River Site," Carter says in his lawsuit. "I was fired for raising concerns about the security of the site." Carter's lawsuit, which accuses the Department of Energy and the inspector general of violating his rights to due process and equal protection under the law, states that he was fired for raising concerns about the security of the site, which he says is one of the most secure nuclear sites in the world. Carter says he was fired for raising concerns about the security of the site—which he calls a "Chernobyl waiting to happen"—despite the fact that the Department of Energy and the inspector general knew about his

– The Supreme Court today struck down a key part of President Obama's health care reform, ruling that the "trigger" in the law's individual mandate is unconstitutional, reports the New York Times. The decision means that the mandate, which requires most Americans to buy health insurance or pay a fine, can't take effect until 2014 at the earliest. The lower court had previously ruled that the mandate couldn't take effect until 2014 at the earliest, but that didn't stop the justices from striking down the second part of the mandate, which requires insurers to cover abortions even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. (See the full text of the justices' decision here.) The third part of the mandate requires the government to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life.

– If you live in a rural part of the US, you may not be able to get high-speed Internet for free. But that's about to change, thanks to a program set to be announced today by the Department of Agriculture, the Wall Street Journal reports. The program, called the Rural Broadband Enhancement Act, will provide up to $30 billion in loans and grants to bring high-speed Internet to rural areas. The money will be doled out through the USDA's Rural Utilities Service, which is part of the Department of Agriculture. The program's stated goal is to bring high-speed Internet—which the Journal calls "the holy grail" for entrepreneurs"—to the unserved and under-served parts of the country. But critics say the money is being doled out to companies that have no actual business in the areas they're trying to serve. "The money is being doled out to companies that have no actual business in the areas they’re trying to serve," a rural broadband advocate tells the Journal.

– When the Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed a new rule earlier this year, it didn't have to worry about getting through Congress first. That's because the 1996Significant Regulation Oversight Act allows the agency to propose "significant rules" and have them approved by Congress within three legislative days, the Wall Street Journal reports. But the agency didn't have to worry about that: The rule was already in effect when President Obama signed it into law in May, and it's not expected to take effect until the end of the year at the earliest, thanks to a provision in the bill that allows Congress to review and approve "significant rules" after they've been proposed by the agency, the New York Times reports. "The intent of the act was to give Congress an adequate opportunity to review and ensure that [the rule] was in accordance with the intent of the law," says the director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which is suing the Occupational Safety and Health Administration over the proposed rule. The Center for Science in the Public Interest is also suing the EPA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, accusing them of violating the 1996 act by failing to provide congressional review, the Times notes.

– If you're in the market for a new car, you may be able to get one for a relatively low price with the help of a state tax credit. The Wall Street Journal reports on a new federal law that lowers the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 28% on profits brought in through a state or local tax credit. The credit is available to taxpayers who are residents of any state that has a income-tax rate of 35% or less, and the new law applies to profits brought in through a state tax credit as well as to those brought in through a local tax credit. The reason for the lower rate is that state and local taxes make up the lion's share of the cost of a new car, with federal taxes making up the lion's share of the cost of most other types of vehicles. The reason for the lower rate is that state and local taxes make up the lion's share of the cost of a new car in most states, with the exception of Alaska, which doesn't have a state or local tax rate at all.

– The Department of Transportation is cracking down on what it calls "unfair and deceptive practices" in the airline industry, the Los Angeles Times reports. Among other things, the new rules will require airlines to inform passengers when a flight has been delayed or canceled, and to give passengers a full refund if they can't get to their destination within 48 hours of the delay. They also will require airlines to provide passengers with information about frequent-flyer programs. The rules are part of the Airline Passenger Fairness Act, which was passed by Congress in 1978 and requires the DOT to "prevent unfair and deceptive practices in the airline industry," according to the Wall Street Journal. The new rules are "long overdue," says an official with the Association of Flight Attendants, which is pushing for the new rules.

– If you work for Wendy's, McDonald's, or Taco Bell, you may be eligible for overtime if you work more than 40 hours in a week. But if you work fewer than 40 hours in a week, you may not be eligible for those overtime hours at all. That's according to a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of current and former employees of Wendy's, McDonald's, and Taco Bell in California, the Los Angeles Times reports. The suit alleges the companies violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National Labor Relations Act, as well as the Americans With Disabilities Act, by paying some employees as little as $7.25 per hour and keeping others from being paid time-and-a-half for working more than 40 hours a week. The suit, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, also alleges the companies violated the National Labor Relations Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act by not paying employees time-and-a-half for working more than 40 hours a week, the New York Daily News reports. Wendy's, McDonald's, and Taco Bell are named as defendants in the suit. The National Labor Relations Board is investigating the alleged violations.

The measure, called the "United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012," gives Israel up to $100 million a year in loan guarantees and military aid, including $30 million for the development of a new missile-defense system called Iron Dome. It would be the first time US aid has been extended for a missile-defense system since 2004, notes the New York Times. The measure is expected to be voted on by the Senate soon.

– In 1906, the US Congress passed the Copper Valley Native Act, which gave the Copper Valley Electric Association the rights to run a transmission line through parts of the American Indian territory of Alaska. Since then, the group has run the line at a cost of more than $1 billion, the Alaska Dispatch News reports. But the Native Americans who live along the line aren't happy about it. They've filed a lawsuit against the association, the state of Alaska, and the US Department of the Interior, claiming the group hasn't compensated them in accordance with the 1906 act, and that the money isn't coming their way. The suit, which was filed in federal court, claims the association hasn't paid them their fair share of the cost of the line, which runs from Kobuk to Mat-Su Valley, the Alaska Dispatch News reports. According to the suit, the group's rightful owners—the Ahtna Indians, who live along the line—didn't sign a contract agreeing to the terms of the 1906 act. They also say the US Department of the Interior didn't conduct an appraisal of the line's rights-of-way as required by the act, the Washington Post reports. According to the suit, the Chugach

– If you've ever wanted to be a master teacher, now's your chance. The US Department of Education is offering $100 million to school districts across the country to hire and promote master teachers, the New York Times reports. Under the Master Teacher Act of 2001, the feds have the power to award grants to school districts, which can then use the money to recruit, train, and promote master teachers. The idea is that master teachers, who have at least five years of teaching under their belt, will improve the skills of other teachers and boost student achievement. The grants will go to districts with the highest percentage of economically disadvantaged students, according to the Times. "It’s a win-win," says the president of the National Association of Secondary School Principals. "The more master teachers we have, the more effective our schools are."

That's the lofty goal of the National Commission for the New National Goal: The Advancement of Global Health, which was created by Congress in 2000 and is currently chaired by Sen. John McCain. The commission is tasked with coming up with a national strategy "for coordinating governmental, academic, and public and private health care entities for the purpose of the global eradication of disease," according to the Commission's website. It's not clear how the plan will be implemented, but McCain has said he'd like to see a "bipartisan, Aspen-style commission" put in place, the Hill reports. The commission will be made up of 13 members, including the secretary of health and human services, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and at least two members of the House and House of Representatives who are of the same political party, according to the Commission's website.

– President Obama has signed a bill that offers veterans a tax credit for working in the renewable-energy industry, the New York Times reports. The White House says it's a first-of-its-kind program that will offer a tax credit of up to 30% of the veteran's salary for up to five years. The bill was signed into law yesterday, and it's expected to help thousands of veterans find work in the renewable-energy field, the Times notes. "Veterans have fought and sacrificed for our country, and they deserve a fair shake when they find work in an industry that can create jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil," Obama said in a statement. The White House says the program will help create 50,000 jobs in the renewable-energy industry over the next five years.

– The National Service for Schools Act of 2015 was signed into law in 1990 by then-President George W. Bush, with the stated goal of getting every American "to serve one year of service in their local community, school, or military office" by the end of the 21st century. It's a lofty goal, but one that's apparently not being met—despite the fact that the act's stated goal is to "meet an unmet human, educational, environmental, or public safety need of the United States, without displacing existing (as of the first date of the opportunity) workers." The New York Times takes a look at the actual wording of the act, which states: "A participant may receive compensation but, except as provided in clauses (I) and (iii), the total compensation, in the aggregate, shall not exceed the product of $10.00 per hour; and (II) the number of the qualifying hours of service involved; and (III) a participant may receive total compensation that exceeds the amount of the participant's corresponding award under subsection (d); and (IV) a participant in a professional corps program described in section 122(c)(1)(D), who is in engaged in a service opportunity that meets human, educational, environmental, or

Called the National Center for Rural Law Enforcement, it's a joint initiative between the FBI and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock that was authorized by the 1997 Rural Law Enforcement Act. According to its website, the center will work with state and local law enforcement agencies to "develop and implement training and education programs for rural law enforcement agencies." It will also work with the FBI to make sure that those agencies have the resources they need to do their jobs safely. One of the main goals of the center is to make sure that police departments in rural areas have the tools they need to keep things on the up-and-up, especially in light of an increase in violent crime in those areas, NPR notes.

– When it comes to the Internal Revenue Code, it's pretty straightforward: " DIVIDENDS OF INDIVIDUALS TAXED AT CAPITAL GAIN RATES." That's the law, of course, and the Wall Street Journal today takes a look at what it means and how it's being interpreted. Here's what you need to know: The law is crystal clear: If you're a resident of the US and own stock in a foreign company, you're taxed at the capital gains rate. But if you own stock in a US company, you're taxed at the capital gains rate. If you own stock in a foreign company but don't hold it for more than a year, you're taxed at the capital gains rate. The difference between the two is that the former stipulates that the stock must be held for at least a year, while the latter stipulates that it must be held for at least a year. If you hold stock for less than a year, you're taxed at the capital gains rate; if you hold stock for more than a year, you're taxed at the capital gains rate. As the Journal explains, it's actually not that hard to figure out if you're paying

– If you're a doctor who's seen a lot of patients in a short period of time, you may have a hard time keeping up with the ever-changing demands of health care. That's why the Obama administration has set up a new task force to figure out how much doctors should be paid for the time they spend seeing patients, the New York Times reports. The task force—which will be made up of experts from the medical, insurance, and academic communities, among others, as well as the president of the American Medical Association—will have three months to come up with its recommendations, which will be presented to the Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general, the Times notes. The task force's recommendations will be used to determine how much doctors should be paid for each patient they see, as well as how much doctors should be paid for certain services (e.g., out-of-state doctors will be paid more, while out-of-state doctors will be paid less). The president of the American Academy of Family Physicians tells the Times that the task force's recommendations "will help ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive high-quality care at the lowest possible out-of-pocket costs."

– If you're in the market for a new roof on your office building, you may be in luck: There's a federal program that will give you a tax credit of up to 30% on the cost of such a project, the Wall Street Journal reports. Congress passed the Building Energy Tax Credit Act of 2009 to help promote the use of green energy. The law gives tax credits of up to 35% of the cost of "energy conservation commercial building property" that is "placed in service by the taxpayer," the Journal notes. The credit can be claimed on the first $1 million of the project's cost; after that, the amount can be as much as 30% of the cost of the project as long as it's completed by the end of the calendar year in which the taxpayer is eligible to claim it. The average cost of such a project is about $54,000, the Journal notes.

– The US Army Corps of Engineers has given the go-ahead to a controversial project that could see billions of dollars spent on upgrades to the nation's water infrastructure, the AP reports. The plan is to spend up to $35 billion over the next 20 years to extend the nation's water infrastructure from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes. The Army Corps of Engineers—which calls the project "one of the largest water infrastructure projects in US history"—says it will make the system more resilient to climate change, improve water quality, and reduce the need for new reservoirs. But critics say the plan to extend the nation's water infrastructure from the Gulf to the Great Lakes—and to spend huge amounts of taxpayer money on it—will wreak havoc on the environment and the economy. "This is one of the most destructive environmental projects we've ever seen," the executive director of the Sierra Club's New York office tells the AP. "It's going to wreak havoc on the environment, the economy, and people's health." The plan to extend the water system from the Gulf to the Great Lakes was approved by Congress in 1992 and the Army Corps of Engineers says it will be part of a larger effort to extend the nation's water infrastructure

– Amtrak's Acela Express is scheduled to make its maiden voyage from Portland, Ore., to New York City on Oct. 1, but it's not going to be without some last-minute hiccups. First, the Federal Railroad Administration has to sign off on a $40 million loan guarantee for the project that will be paid back with interest, the Portland Press Herald reports. And that's not all: The agreement also calls for another $40 million in guarantees to be provided by the Federal Railroad Administration and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to help with the project's financing, the New York Times reports. What's more, Amtrak's parent company, Union Pacific, is in talks with the Federal Railroad Administration and the Port Authority to get another loan guarantee to help pay for the remainder of the project, which is expected to cost more than $200 million, the Times notes. The loan guarantee is part of the Department of Transportation's $2 trillion spending plan for infrastructure projects that President Obama signed into law in May, the Times notes. But Amtrak, which says the Acela Express will be the country's first high-speed rail line from Portland to New York, isn't happy with the deal. "The loan guarantee is a poor deal

– The US isn't the only country that doesn't want to pay its fair share when it comes to the cost of having American troops stationed around the world. Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom all say they'd be happy to increase their contributions if the US would agree to pay at least 75% of the cost of having US troops stationed there, the Christian Science Monitor reports. "If the economically strong NATO allies of the United States had contributed 75% of the overseas basing costs that were incurred for fiscal year 1992 for United States forces in that country, the United States would have saved an estimated $5,000,000,000 of the amount paid by the United States for overseas basing costs for that fiscal year," says a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which notes that Germany, Italy, the UK, and Japan all increased their contributions in that year.

The justices on Monday upheld the Citizens United case, which opened the door to super PACs that can spend unlimited sums on political ads without having to disclose them to the candidate they're supporting, the New York Times reports. The case revolves around a provision in the 1971 Federal Election Act known as Section 527, which allows unlimited donations from "any committee, club, association, or other group of persons." It's not clear how many super PACs exist, but the Center for Public Integrity estimates there are between 2,000 and 3,000 in the country. The law's supporters say it's a victory for free speech, but critics say it's a case of the government overstepping its bounds. The justices said the law's definition of "major purpose" was too broad, and that super PACs shouldn't be allowed to coordinate with candidates, the Wall Street Journal reports. The justices didn't rule on whether super PACs should be allowed to coordinate with political groups, but they said the government must show that such coordination is necessary to "meet the major purpose" of the law

– An Israeli court has convicted a 15-year-old Palestinian girl of throwing a stone at an Israeli soldier, but the soldier says the girl was trying to throw the stone at him, not the other way around. The girl's mother tells Haaretz that the soldier hit her daughter in the head with a rubber bullet, then grabbed her by the hair and dragged her into a West Bank cell, where she was beaten and forced to confess to the crime. The girl's mother says she was only released to her family the next day. The girl is one of around 700 Palestinian children between the ages of 12 and 17 who are detained by the Israeli military each year and prosecuted in the Israeli military court system, though children under the age of 12 aren't allowed to be prosecuted, the AP reports. Human Rights Watch last year reported that the Israeli military has used chokeholds, beatings, and torture in the interrogations of children between the ages of 11 and 15. The Israeli military court system is "widespread, systematic, and institutionalized throughout the process, from the moment of arrest until the child's prosecution and eventual conviction and sentencing," according to the State Department's annual report on human rights in Israel.

– New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed a bill that makes it legal for retired police officers to carry concealed weapons on government property, the New York Daily News reports. According to the New York Times, Cuomo signed the bill into law on Friday, making New York the 14th state to legalize concealed weapons for retired police officers. Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island have already legalized concealed weapons for retired police officers. The law was inspired by a 1997 federal law, the Law Enforcement Protection Act of 1997, which allowed retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons on government property, the Daily News reports. According to the Times, Cuomo signed the bill in front of a crowd of law enforcement officers, including retired NYPD chief Ray Kelly, who was in attendance. The bill's supporters include the New York State Police, the New York City Police Department, the New York City Sheriff's Office, and the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, the Daily News reports. According to the Times, Cuomo signed the bill in front of a crowd of law enforcement officers, including retired NYPD chief Ray Kelly.

– New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed into law a bill that will make it easier for teachers to become licensed in the state, the New York Times reports. The bill, which was signed into law Thursday, allows teachers to be licensed for up to three years after they've finished teaching in New York public schools. Currently, teachers can only be licensed for two years after they've finished teaching in New York public schools. According to the Wall Street Journal, teachers can be licensed for up to eight years after they've finished teaching in New York public schools. The bill will allow teachers to be licensed for up to 18 years after they've finished teaching in New York public schools. According to the Times, Cuomo says the bill is an attempt to "attract and retain the best and the brightest" in the state's classrooms.

– If you have a medical savings account, you're in luck: The IRS just made it easier for you to sock away money for medical expenses. Specifically, you can now sock away up to $12,000 for a single person and $18,000 for a married couple, reports the Wall Street Journal. The upshot is that you're no longer limited by the number of medical savings accounts you can open. It used to be that if you had a medical savings account, you couldn't actually deduct the cost of your health care. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, you can now do so.

– In the 1970s and '80s, the feds tried to clean up the so-called "brownfield" properties that had sprung up around the country—think abandoned factories, student housing, and so forth—but they didn't always have the money or manpower to do so, the New York Times reports. Now, thanks to a new federal program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development will be able to award up to $2 billion in grants to help clean up those properties. "We've never had this kind of flexibility in the past," says HUD chief Julian Castro. "This is the first time we've had this kind of flexibility." The money will be doled out under the Brownfields Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, which gives the EPA the power to award the grants, the Times notes. The program is intended to help clean up properties that have been contaminated by things like heavy rains, pollution, or Superfund sites, where toxins such as arsenic, chromium, and lead have seeped into the soil and water. But critics say the program doesn't do enough to help clean up the properties themselves, and that the money is being doled out to companies that have done nothing but profited from the contamination, the Times notes.

– Filed under the "Interference Protection Act of 2013" is a piece of legislation called the "Wireless Microphone Users' Bill of Rights" that, as its name suggests, aims to protect users of wireless microphones from interference from TV broadcasts. It's set to go into effect Jan. 1, and it gives the Federal Communications Commission the authority to issue licenses to people who want to use wireless microphones at venues such as amusement parks, stadiums, houses of worship, museums, hotels, and other venues, the New York Times reports. The idea behind the bill is to give broadcasters more room to block certain kinds of radio signals, such as guard bands and the mid-band gap between the frequencies designated for uplink and downlink service in the 600 MHz spectrum, the Washington Post reports. The FCC says it plans to "expand the scope of service regulation" to include wireless microphones in rehearsals and live or recorded events, as well as in places like houses of worship and recording studios. But not everyone is thrilled with the bill, and not just because it gives broadcasters more room to block certain kinds of radio signals. The Anti-Defamation League, for example, says it plans to file a formal complaint with the FCC, as well as challenge the legality of the bill in court.

– The Trump administration has made it easier for farmers to apply for federal programs that help them protect the environment, the New York Times reports. Under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, farmers can get up to 75% of the costs for certain conservation projects associated with their operations, up to 40% of those costs for things like animal mortality facilities and fish tanks, and up to 100% of those costs for things like land clearing, pipeline construction, and spoil spreading. Farmers can also get up to 100% of the costs for things like waste transfer or a waste treatment lagoon. But there's one group that's not happy about the Trump administration's EQIP policy: the Sierra Club. "The EQIP program is one of the most important environmental programs in the country," the group's government affairs director tells the Times. "It's one of the most important programs for conservation in the country. It's also one of the most expensive programs, and it's being rolled out at a time when we're facing unprecedented threats to the environment from climate change, from disease, from over-harvesting, and from natural disasters." The Times notes that the Trump administration has made other changes to the EQIP program in recent years, including making it easier

– President Obama has signed a bill that could make the US a world leader in the development of clean energy, the New York Times reports. The Department of Energy's 2015 Energy Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act, which was signed into law last week, calls for the department to work more closely with the private sector to develop alternative energy sources, such as nuclear fusion and wind energy. The bill's supporters say it will create jobs and help the US become a leader in clean energy, but critics say it will do more harm than good. "Instead of partnering with the private sector, the Department of Energy should be partnering with state and local governments," Sen. Tom Udall tells the Times. The bill calls for the department to work more closely with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, among others, to develop technologies that could be transferred from the federal government to the private sector. The bill also calls for the department to work more closely with the University of California-Irvine and Stanford University, among others, to develop technologies that could be transferred from the federal government to the private sector. Supporters of the bill say it will create thousands of jobs and help the US become a leader in clean energy.

– The ex-wife of NFL player Ray Rice has filed a lawsuit against the Baltimore Ravens, alleging the team refused to cover her after she filed a police report alleging domestic violence at her ex-husband's hands, the New York Daily News reports. Rice's lawsuit, which names the Baltimore Ravens, the Baltimore Police Department, and the Baltimore County Sheriff's Office, says the team refused to pay for medical care for Rice after she sought treatment for a concussion she suffered during a fight with her ex-husband at a Baltimore hotel last year. She also says the team refused to cover the cost of a physical exam she needed to get her driver's license, even though she had filed a police report alleging domestic violence at her ex-husband's hands. The lawsuit, which accuses the Ravens and the police of violating the victims' access to health care provision of the Violence Against Women Act, seeks $5 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages, the Daily News reports. The law was passed in 2000 to protect victims of domestic violence and other crimes from being denied health insurance because of their status, the Daily News notes.

– A provision in the farm bill signed into law by President Trump last week is designed to help first-time farmers get off the farm and into the business of farming, the AP reports. The Young and Beginning Farmers Act gives the Department of Agriculture three years to come up with programs to help first-time farmers get off the farm and into the business of farming. It also gives the USDA three years to come up with programs to help farmers sell their surplus farm equipment or property to "socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers, veteran farmers or ranchers, or beginning farmers or ranchers," as well as to support farmers' market and local food systems. The provision in the farm bill is designed to help first-time farmers get off the farm and into the business of farming, the Des Moines Register reports. It's not clear how many first-time farmers will be affected by the provision, but the National Corn Growers Association says it will help "millions of first-time farmers."

According to a letter from the Army Corps of Engineers to state and local officials, construction on federal roads and highways can cause up to 10% more water to run off into streams and watersheds than is allowed by federal law. The letter says construction on roads and highways that cause more than 10% more water to run off into streams or watersheds can be punished with up to five years in prison and a $1 million fine. The Army Corps of Engineers—which says it's the first federal agency to enforce the law—says construction on roads and highways that cause more than 10% more water to run off into streams and watersheds can be punished with up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.

– An Army veteran who went to the ER at Texas Children's Hospital to be checked out for a potentially life-threatening pregnancy wound ended up giving birth to a stillborn baby—and is now suing the hospital, the Texas Department of State Health Services, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs, the Houston Chronicle reports. According to a lawsuit filed last week, 30-year-old Army veteran Edward Barringer went to the ER at Texas Children's on Nov. 11 because he was experiencing chest pains and wanted to be checked out for a "potentially life-threatening condition," but the hospital refused to take him and instead sent him to an emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in the lung. Barringer, who served in Iraq and was discharged from the Army in 2013, is suing for medical malpractice, emotional distress, lost wages, and punitive damages, the Chronicle reports. "The Department of Veterans Affairs and Texas Children's Hospital have violated their oaths of office to serve and protect our nation's veterans," Barringer's attorney says in the lawsuit, which accuses the hospital of violating the Veterans Emergency Treatment Act and the Department of Veterans Affairs' contract with Texas Children's by failing to provide Barringer with proper care.

– It's been 20 years since the "Safe Schools Act of 1994" was established to combat violence in America's schools, and the Department of Education is set to announce a five-year, $50 million grant program today to help fight such violence, USA Today reports. The money will go to programs including "school safety models," "violence and discipline problems," and "victimization of youth by violence, crime, or other forms of abuse," according to a department press release. The grants will be awarded to "local educational agencies ... serving an area in which there is a high rate of homicides committed by persons between the ages 5 to 18, inclusive," and to schools in areas with "serious school crime, violence, and discipline problems," USA Today notes. According to the press release, the 1994 act "shall develop a safe schools model so all schools can develop models that enable all students to participate regardless of any language." The grant program is just one component of the department's plan to make America's schools "drug-free, safe, and free of violence," according to the press release. The department is also aiming to make schools more "evidence-based," according to the release.

– Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the US, with approximately 40,000 women dying of the disease each year, the American Cancer Society reported last month. To that end, President Obama has signed an executive order designed to boost research into the environment's role in the disease, the Washington Post reports. The order, which Congress passed in 2001, calls for the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences a Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Center of Excellence. The institute will make grants "after a process of peer review and peer review, to public or nonprofit private entities for the purpose of conducting multidisciplinary and multi-institutional research on  environmental factors that may be related to the etiology of breast cancer," according to the order. The order also calls for the creation of a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' National Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Center of Excellence in each of the 50 US states. The initiative is expected to cost an estimated $115 million over 10 years.

– If you own a semi-truck, you may be able to get by with a little less help from the federal government. The Wall Street Journal reports that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1994—which was signed into law by President Clinton in 1994—allows the Department of Transportation to set rates for semi-trucks based on a trucker's cost of fuel. The problem is that the federal government doesn't regulate the trucking industry as it does the oil and gas industries, and the rates the DOT sets for semi-trucks are often higher than the cost of the fuel they carry. As a result, the trucking industry has been complaining for years that the higher rates it has to pay the government are keeping them from hiring more drivers and improving safety. The problem is that the DOT doesn't regulate the trucking industry as it does the oil and gas industries, and the semi-truck industry doesn't even own a semi-truck. In fact, it doesn't even own a semi-truck at all.

The Children's Health Insurance Program will make it easier for kids in families making less than three times the poverty level to sign up for the program, which is paid for by the federal government and state taxpayers. Families making up to four times the poverty level will be able to sign up for the program, and kids in families making up to eight times the poverty level will be able to sign up for it. The goal is to cut down on fraud and waste and to make it easier for kids who might otherwise be unable to afford medical care to do so, the Washington Post reports.

– If you're in the market for a new air-conditioning unit, you'll soon be able to buy one that's got the Energy Star stamp of approval. But if you're in the market for a less-expensive model, you'll have to settle for a less-expensive one. That's because the federal government is now requiring that all new air-conditioning units sold in the US get an Energy Star rating, the Wall Street Journal reports. The move is part of a push by the Obama administration to make it easier for consumers to buy energy-efficient products, the Journal notes. The new rule, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will require new units sold in the US to have an Energy Star rating within five years, the Journal reports. That rating will be based on a product's energy efficiency, the Journal notes, and it will be based on a product's "basic model group"—which, the Journal notes, means it "share[s] characteristics that allow the performance of [a] representative of the performance of other models." If a product doesn't meet the rating, it can be removed.

– The American Military Retirees Association is a nonprofit that was federally chartered in New York in 1986 to "protect earned benefits by educating on benefits available," as its website puts it, and to "advocate for the protection of earned benefits through active monitoring of legislation in Congress and the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs." But when it comes to veterans' issues, the group has had a hard time staying on the right side of the law, the New York Daily News reports. According to the IRS, the American Military Retirees Association hasn't had a tax-exempt status since 1986, and it's spent more than $100,000 on legal fees alone.

– The Obama administration is cracking down on for-profit hospitals that skirt a 1997 law banning them from receiving Medicare payments, the New York Times reports. Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services is investigating whether Brigham and Women's Hospital in Provo, Utah, and Evergreen Health System in Kirkland, Wash.—two of the nation's largest for-profit hospitals—violated the law by selling their assets to for-profit entities without first getting the green light from the Department of Health and Human Services. The law was passed as part of the Medicare Nonprofit Hospital Protection Act of 1997 and prohibits non-profit hospitals from receiving Medicare payments if they transfer assets or control to a for-profit entity without first getting approval from the Department of Health and Human Services. Brigham and Women's Hospital, one of the country's largest not-for-profit hospitals, is owned by Evergreen Health, which is also the parent company of Evergreen Health Medical Center and Brigham and Women's Hospital. The for-profit hospitals say they're complying with the law and that the HHS review found no evidence of "inappropriately benefited any private parties." But critics say the law is so murky that for-profit hospitals can legally buy non-for-profit hospitals if they want to

– You can drive across the border from Mexico without having to worry about getting pulled over for running a red light. That's because of a 1998 law called the "Border Smog Reduction Act of 1998," which prohibits all " noncommercial motor vehicles" from crossing the border unless they're registered in a foreign country and operated by a US citizen or permanent resident, the Los Angeles Times reports. "No noncommercial motor vehicle" can enter a "covered ozone nonattainment area" more than twice in a single calendar month, according to the 1998 law, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. An analysis by the Center for Science in the Public Interest published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine last month found that the law's impact on air quality in areas affected by smog "appears to be minimal," the New York Times reports.

The union is also suing the Air Force Times for not allowing the flag to fly at half-mast on Veterans Day, according to the Post. The lawsuit claims that the Times' decision to allow the flag to fly at half-mast is an "affront" to veterans and their families, as well as an "affront to the Constitution of the United States," which states that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any public office" and that "discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, disability, age, or national origin" is prohibited.

– If you've ever wondered what it's like to work for the federal government, well, here's your answer: "It's a lot of money." That's because, as the Wall Street Journal explains, the feds set up a Thrift Savings Plan for employees when they were still working for the government, and the money they save through the plan goes straight to the employees' retirement accounts. The problem is that the Thrift Savings Plan is managed by the Social Security Administration, and the feds don't like how it's run.

– It's called the "American ManufacturingCompetitiveness Act of 2015," and it's designed to put the brakes on what President Trump calls "unfair" trade practices. Specifically, it would suspend or reduce duties on US-produced industrial goods that aren't being made in the US, and it would set a 90-day deadline for the US International Trade Commission to do so, reports the Wall Street Journal. The move is designed to reduce the "artificial distortions" caused by an outdated tariff schedule that's been in place for too long, according to the bill. "It is the sense of Congress that, to remove the competitive disadvantage to United States manufactures and consumers resulting from an outdated Harmonized Tariff Schedule and to promote the competitiveness of United States manufacturers, Congress should consider a miscellaneous tariff bill not later than 180 days after the United States International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce issue reports on proposed duty suspensions and reductions under this Act," reads the bill, which was signed into law last week by Trump. It's not clear how long it would take for the duties to be suspended or reduced, but the Journal notes that it could take as long as a year. The move is designed to help US manufacturers compete in the global economy, and it's being

– The Cherokee Nation has been fighting tooth and nail to ensure that its members have enough diapers to raise their children, and the Department of Health and Human Services has just made it easier for them to do so. The department is directing $50 million to 31 tribes across the country to distribute diapers to low-income families, reports the Washington Post. The move is part of a larger effort by the department to provide diapers to as many low-income families as it can, in an effort to cut down on health risks related to diaper dermatitis, urinary tract infections, depression, and increased rates of parental and child anxiety, among other things. The Cherokee Nation was one of the first to apply for a grant under the new program, which was announced last month. The money will go to groups that provide services to at-risk families in areas such as child care, nutrition, and maternal and child health, reports the Cherokee Nation Times. The idea is to make the diapers more affordable for low-income families, and the projects that receive the grants will be evaluated to make sure they're working. The program is set to wrap up in September.

The funds will be used to train and equip African troops to push the LRA out of northern Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and to help former rebels reintegrate into society, reports the New York Times. The LRA has been fighting for more than 20 years against the government of President Yoweri Museveni, but it's only recently that the rebels have been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including rape, murder, and torture.

– The White House has released its long-awaited National Strategy for Homeland Security, and it's a doozy. The 10-page document lays out the government's plan to keep the country safe from terrorism and other threats, with a particular focus on chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, reports the New York Times. Among other things, it calls for the US to step up its cooperation with other countries in the fight against such threats, and to work more closely with the private sector to do so. President Obama is expected to unveil the strategy at a White House event tomorrow.

– When the East Coast was still reeling from the devastation of Superstorm Sandy, Congress decided to do something about it: It passed the Natural Disaster Mitigation Act of 2011, which provides a tax credit of up to 25% of the cost of "qualified natural disaster mitigation property" spent on homes and other structures, the Washington Post reports. Among other things, the law allows taxpayers to claim up to a $5,000 credit on their 2011 tax return, though it stipulates that the credit can't exceed 25% of the taxpayer's "qualified principal residence"—that is, the home where the taxpayer's spouse lives. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who signed the bill into law last week, says the law is an important piece of the Sandy recovery effort and that he'll be pushing to get it passed in his state as well, the New York Daily News reports.

– If you're under the age of 5 and speak a language other than English at home, there's a good chance you won't be able to understand the proceedings of a criminal trial if you don't speak English well. That's because, according to a 2000 executive order, only 18% of Americans over the age of 5 speak a language other than English at home, the Los Angeles Times reports. To remedy that, the Justice Department has allocated $5 million to 29 states for the purpose of hiring and training interpreters who can help those with limited English proficiency understand court proceedings, the New York Times reports. The money will go toward recruitment, training, and certification for court interpreters, as well as for technology to help them do their jobs, the Times notes. The funding is part of a larger effort by the Justice Department to make it easier for people with limited English proficiency to understand court proceedings, the Times notes. The department has also established a task force to figure out how to make it easier for people with limited English proficiency to understand court proceedings.

– The US government is allowing private companies to drill for oil and gas off the coast of Texas and Louisiana, despite sanctions against Iran and a ban on US companies doing business with the country's state-owned oil company, the Wall Street Journal reports. The move is in keeping with a law signed by President Obama in November that bans US companies from doing business with Iran's state-owned oil company, National Iranian Oil Company. The law also bans US companies from dealing with Iran's state-owned oil company, and it requires companies doing business with it to disclose any ties to Iran's nuclear program. A company that does business with Iran's state-owned oil company is still allowed to do business with the US, but it must disclose any ties to Iran's nuclear program. A company that does business with Iran's state-owned oil company is still allowed to do business with the US, but it must disclose any ties to Iran's nuclear program.

– A whistleblower who filed a class-action lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler over faulty Jeep Grand Cherokees has been awarded more than $3 million, the New York Daily News reports. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, claims the company knowingly sold more than 10 million vehicles with defective undercarriages in the US. According to the Wall Street Journal, the lawsuit claims Fiat Chrysler knew about the problem as early as 2000 but didn't report it to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The company also allegedly tried to cover up the defect by paying whistleblowers to keep quiet, the lawsuit claims. The amount awarded to the unidentified whistleblower is more than three times what the company paid to whistleblowers in a similar class-action lawsuit filed last year, the Daily News reports. The lawsuit claims Fiat Chrysler knew about the defect as early as 2000 but didn't report it to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Journal reports. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission have not commented on the lawsuit.

– America's students are among the best in the world when it comes to math and science, but when it comes to gifted and talented students, the US ranks dead last, according to a new report from the National Center for Education Statistics. The center, part of the Education Department, says the US has about 3 million gifted and talented students, but only about a third of them receive any kind of federal funding for education, the New York Times reports. That's not good enough, says Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, who wants to see the number of gifted and talented students in the US triple to 100,000 over the next decade. "We have to do something about it," Alexander tells the Times. "It's not enough to say, 'Here's a kid who can do this, and here's a kid who can't.' We have to say, 'Here's a kid who can do this, and here's a kid who can.'" Alexander wants to see the number of gifted and talented students increased from the current 3 million to 100,000 over the next decade, and he's not alone. President Obama also wants to see the number of gifted and talented students increase.

– The UN has more troops on the ground than anywhere else in the world, but it needs a lot more of them. That's why the White House is pushing hard to get Congress to pass the United Nations Rapid Deployment Act of 2001, which would give the UN the power to quickly deploy brigades of up to 40,000 troops around the globe, the New York Times reports. "The present United Nations system relies almost entirely on last minute, ad- hoc arrangements that guarantee delay, with respect to the provision of civilian personnel even more so than military personnel," says a report from the UN's secretary-general released in 2000. "The six-month estimated cost of the deployment would have been $115 million. Instead, the genocide consumed 800,000 lives along with $2,000 million in humanitarian aid." The act was passed after the UN failed to send 5,500 peacekeepers to Rwanda in time to stop the genocide there in 1994.

– If you're a Verizon customer, you'll soon have to switch to another carrier if the government is going to force Verizon to move its headquarters from Washington, DC, to St. Louis, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. According to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the move is required under a 2008 law called the "Relocation Improvement Act of 2008." The law states that if a federal agency needs to relocate its headquarters from a certain band of frequencies, it must give 60 days' notice to the public. Verizon, which is based in Washington, DC, isn't giving that notice. The Post-Dispatch reports the company has been trying to move its headquarters for two years, but it hasn't been able to get an official notice from the NTIA, which is the government agency that oversees the telecommunications industry. The reason for the delay is that the NTIA is in the process of setting up a special fund to compensate Verizon for the cost of the move, according to the Post-Dispatch. The money will come from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, which is supposed to be set up to compensate federal agencies that need to move their headquarters from certain frequencies. Verizon has been trying to move its headquarters to St. Louis for two years

– For more than 50 years, Puerto Ricans have had two options when it comes to their political future: Stay with the US as an unincorporated territory or become a state, the New York Times reports. But with the territory's economy in dire straits, many Puerto Ricans are now considering the latter option, which would see them vote on whether to remain a territory of the US or become a full-fledged state, with full equality with the US mainland. The two options will be on the ballot in a referendum that could take place as early as next year, USA Today reports. But even if Puerto Rico's residents choose statehood, the US government will still have control over the territory's $74 billion in debt, and many Puerto Ricans are worried about their children's futures as a result of the island's economic crisis. "I'm worried about my children's future. I'm worried about the future of my family," a woman who moved to the US from Puerto Rico when she was 12 tells the Times. "I don't want to live in a situation where I'm dependent on the federal government for everything. I don't want to live in a situation where my children are starving. I don't want

– If you're in the market for a new semi-automatic weapon, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has some advice: Don't buy one from Dick's Sporting Goods. The company is in the midst of a legal battle with the FTC over its "kit" for semi-automatic weapons, which the Wall Street Journal reports can cost up to $500. The kit, which includes a case for the weapon, a magazine, and a receiver, violates a 1986 federal law banning "deceptive" advertising of firearms, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. "If you're going to advertise something that's illegal, you should advertise it in a way that's legal," an official with the commission tells the Journal. "That's what we're trying to do here. We're not trying to take away people's Second Amendment rights, we're trying to take away their ability to sell something that's illegal." But Dick's Sporting Goods is fighting back, arguing that the 1986 law doesn't apply because the kit is for personal use and isn't meant to be sold to the general public, the New York Daily News reports. The company is also arguing that the FTC doesn't have the authority to regulate its

– The State Department's inspector general is blasting the department for spending more than $1 million of taxpayer money on a trip to Cuba that wasn't supposed to be paid for by the US, the New York Times reports. The trip, which included a stop at the Jose Marti International Airport in Havana, was authorized under the Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 and the Television Broadcasting to Cuba Act of 1977, as well as theMutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, according to the department's inspector general. The trip was supposed to be paid for by the National Endowment for Democracy and the East-West Center, which is part of the State Department's Office of Inspector General. But it was paid for by the US Agency for International Development, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, the Washington Post reports. The State Department's inspector general says the trip was supposed to be paid for by the US Agency for International Development, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, and not by the State Department, which is part of the Office of Inspector General. "This trip was supposed to be paid for by the United States," the inspector general says. "It's a waste of taxpayer money."

– The Department of Veterans Affairs has made it easier for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder to care for their children by expanding its on-site child care program, the New York Times reports. The program, which provides up to $3,000 a month for a veteran's child to help pay for care at on-site child-care centers or private child-care agencies, was included in the $1.1 trillion spending bill that President Trump signed into law last week. It's not clear how many veterans are eligible for the program, but the Times notes that it's a big change from the VA's previous policy of covering up to six months of child-care costs for veterans with PTSD or traumatic brain injury. The program is set to expire in 2024.

– Native Americans aren't allowed to buy cigarettes in the US, and the Cherokee Nation is now suing to make sure that doesn't happen. The suit, which was filed in US District Court for the Northern District of California last week, alleges that the feds have violated a 1930 law that prohibits Native Americans from buying cigarettes in the US, the Los Angeles Times reports. According to the suit, the only way for Native Americans to buy cigarettes in the US is by going through a third-party delivery service—like Amazon or USPS—and paying a fee. The Cherokee Nation, which has around 2,800 members, says the federal government doesn't have the authority to regulate the sale of cigarettes in the US because it's a sovereign nation. The suit accuses the US Department of Health and Human Services of violating that law by requiring Native Americans to buy cigarettes through third-party delivery services. It also accuses the feds of failing to enforce the 1930 law, which was meant to protect Native Americans from second-hand smoke. The federal government argues that Native Americans aren't allowed to buy cigarettes because they're under the authority of the US government, which has the power to regulate the sale of cigarettes. But the Cherokee Nation says the government doesn't have

– If you're over the age of 70 and living in California, you may be able to take advantage of a new law that allows you to deduct the cost of your home's property taxes from your income, the Los Angeles Times reports. The law was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown last week, and it's expected to save senior citizens an estimated $150 million a year in property tax payments. The law is named the "Seniors Real Property Tax Relief Act of 1998" in the state's Revenue Code, and it allows seniors to deduct the cost of their home's property taxes from their income, as long as they're not in their 70s or older and haven't paid state or local property taxes in the previous year. The Times notes that the law is set to go into effect Jan. 1, and it's not clear how many senior citizens will be eligible to take advantage of it.

– In 2000, Congress passed the Project SEARCH Act—better known as the "Small Community Environmental Grant Act of 2000"—in an effort to help small communities meet environmental goals. But funding for environmental projects in small communities can be hard to come by, and "traditional sources of funding for environmental projects require expensive, complex studies or other application materials," according to the act. So the EPA came up with the Small Community Environmental Grant Program, which provides grants of up to $1 million to small communities for "special environmental assistance for the regulation of communities and habitat awarded under section 4(c)(3)" of the act. The program is open to any small community with a population of not more than 2,500 people in any of the states that have established an independent citizens' council. The EPA says the program will help small communities "meet environmental goals by providing funding for small community environmental projects that will benefit the public health or welfare or the environment." The agency says the program will help small communities "meet environmental goals by providing funding for small community environmental projects that will benefit the public health or welfare or the environment." The grants are available to any state with an independent citizens' council, and the EPA says it will work with councils in all 50 states to make the application process as easy as possible.

– The federal government needs to do a better job of hiring and promoting minorities and women, according to a new report from the Office of Personnel Management. The report found that minorities made up 22.5% of Senior Executive Service members in 2007, compared to 15.8% in whites, 7.9% in Hispanics, and 9.1% in women, the Washington Post reports. It also found that the percentage of African-American men in the service dropped from 5.5% in 2007 to 5.1% in 2007. The report calls for the government to create a Senior Executive Service Resource Office, which would work with agencies to ensure that more minorities and women are hired for top government jobs.

– President Obama today signed a measure into law that aims to make it easier for small businesses to get credit, the New York Times reports. The measure, part of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, gives the Treasury Department the authority to transfer funds from the Small Business Lending Fund to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. "Families and small businesses in under-served areas have for generations been unable to access affordable credit," Obama said in signing the bill. "The financial crisis of 2008 only served to exacerbate efforts by entrepreneurs to access capital for the purpose of creating jobs and improving economic outcomes in the community." The measure is expected to boost lending to small businesses by $5 billion.

– President Obama has signed an executive order designed to help small Mexican-American communities along the US-Mexico border, the AP reports. The "Colonias Improvement Act of 2014" directs the EPA to come up with a plan for improving conditions in communities called colonias, which are defined in the law as "a community within 75 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico." The order also calls for a review of existing programs to make sure they're helping the colonias they're supposed to help, and for Congress to make recommendations to the EPA and the Department of Agriculture on how to make those programs more effective. Obama signed the order last night in El Paso, Texas, the New York Times reports. "This is a great day for the people of the colonias," said Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragan, a Democrat who introduced the bill in the House. "It's going to help a lot of people."

– Amtrak's plan to build a second line from Portland, Ore., to New York City has met with some resistance from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office, the New York Times reports. In a letter to Amtrak's CEO, Cuomo says he has "serious concerns" about the "financial viability" of the plan, which was approved by the Federal Railroad Administration last month. He wants Amtrak to provide more details on how it plans to pay for the project, which is expected to cost between $5 billion and $6 billion, the Wall Street Journal reports. Cuomo's office says it has asked Amtrak to provide more details on how it plans to pay for the project, as well as how it plans to pay for it if the credit rating agency Moody's downgrades Amtrak's credit to "junk" from "stable." Moody's is expected to release a report on the project later this month.

– The US-Mexico border is one of the world's most dangerous places for people to get sick, and a new law aims to remedy that. The Border Health Security Act of 2015 gives the US-Mexico Border Health Commission the authority to issue grants to help states and communities along the border fight diseases such as tuberculosis, diabetes, and obesity, reports the New York Times. The law also calls for the commission to work with the Canada-United States Pan-Border Public Health Preparedness Council to come up with plans for dealing with any public health emergencies along the border, reports the CBC. The law's language is a bit confusing, but here's what it says: "To improve the health of the United States-Mexico border area and United States-Canada border area residents, the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission shall provide grants to eligible entities to address priorities and operational work, including but not limited to, improving the health of United States-Mexico border area residents, and United States-Canada border area residents." The US-Mexico border has some of the highest rates of diabetes, obesity, and unemployment in the world, and 75% of Canadians live within 100 miles of the border.

– If you're in the market for a new roof, you're in luck: There's a federal program that will give you a tax break on the cost of such a roof, the Wall Street Journal reports. Specifically, you can get a tax break of up to 50% on the cost of "qualified renewable energy property," which includes things like solar panels, wind turbines, and water heating systems. The rules are laid out in a 1986 law called the "Renewable Energy Act for Credit on Taxes," but it's not clear how well they've been interpreted, the Journal notes. For example, a taxpayer who installs a solar system on his or her home can get a $6,000 credit on the cost of the system, while a taxpayer who installs a wind turbine on his or her home can get a $4.50 credit on the cost of that turbine. But the law doesn't spell out how much of the cost of the system must be covered by the federal government, the Journal notes. So what's the big deal? According to the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, the cost of a new roof is one of the biggest costs a homeowner has to deal with, the Washington Post reports.

– It's called the "Acid Rain and Mercury Control Act," but it's a little more complicated than that. The act, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2009, aims to reduce acid rain from power plants by cutting emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, the New York Times reports. Acid rain is caused by the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. When it hits the ground, it wreaks havoc on ecosystems, including lakes in the Adirondacks in New York. Since 1990, some acidic lakes in the Adirondacks have started to show chemical recovery from acid rain, but the recovery is "progressing at a slower rate than originally intended," according to the EPA, which estimates that emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide will be cut 70% and 60%, respectively, under the act. But not everyone is thrilled with the plan. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, for example, has asked the EPA to delay the implementation of the act, which is expected to cost the state up to $150 million a year, the Adirondack Daily Enterprise reports. The president of the New York chapter of the Sierra Club calls the plan "absurd" and says it "will do more harm than good."

– If you work for a small company that doesn't have a pension plan, you may want to think twice before socking away money in a 401(k)—because you could be paying taxes on that money for years to come, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to the Internal Revenue Code, small companies that don't have a pension plan are allowed to set up a 401(k) for their employees—provided they have at least 21 shareholders, who are "owned, democratically controlled cooperative organizations that ... meet the requirements of subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986," as the Journal puts it. The problem is that the cooperatives aren't "owned, in whole or in part, or managed or controlled" by the company's management, and thus aren't allowed to "create, by and between themselves, service organizations owned and between themselves, service organizations owned and controlled exclusively by small employer benefit arrangements to provide for such products and services in the fulfillment of their purposes," as the Journal puts it. If you're an employee of a small company and you sock away money in a 401(k) while working for that company, you could be paying taxes on that money for years to come, even if you didn't contribute anything to the

– The federal government has stepped in to help out West Virginia's cash-strapped cities, towns, and counties. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the feds are providing the Charleston City Council with $2 million under the State and Local Government Economic Empowerment Act, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2011. The law allows states, counties, and Indian tribes to get interest-free loans from the feds for infrastructure projects, like roads, bridges, waste water systems, and tunnels. The program has been used before, but this is the first time it's been used to help municipalities, the Gazette-Mail reports. The money is being provided by the Office of Management and Budget, which says in a press release that it's "providing assistance to communities that need it the most to rebuild and improve their infrastructure." Charleston is one of several cities in the state that has been struggling to pay its bills, the Gazette-Mail reports. According to the Charleston Daily Mail, the city's biggest problem is its lack of money to pay its bills, which has caused it to default on more than $100 million in loans and grants from the state and the federal government. The city council has asked the Obama administration for $2 million to help it pay its bills.

– Environmentalists have a new weapon in their fight against global warming: The House is set to vote today on legislation that would require the EPA to set carbon-dioxide limits for the first time, reports the Hill. The measure is part of the Small Business, Family Farms, andConstitutional Protection Act, which prohibits the use of federal funds to implement the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. The EPA says it has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act, but critics say that would amount to a "revision" of the legislative power of the Congress. The bill would require the EPA to set the limits by 2020, but it's not clear whether it would be able to do so by then. The EPA says it has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act, but critics say that would amount to a usurpation of legislative power.

– The estate tax is back in the news, and this time it's not because of the Bush tax cuts. Instead, it's because of a law passed by Congress in 2008 called the Sensible Estate Tax Act of 2008—or, as it's more commonly known, the " Sunset Not to Apply" law, the Wall Street Journal reports. The law allows the tax to be paid on estates that are worth more than $5 million a year, even if the taxpayer's annual income is less than the $5 million threshold. The law was meant to help the poor, but it's now being used by wealthy Americans to pay for the government's deficit-reduction efforts, the Journal notes.

The report says the Pentagon's Office of Management and Budget didn't follow proper procedures when it approved the project for the National Institute of Standards and Technology at Patuxent River, reports the Washington Post. The GAO found that the project—which was approved by the Pentagon's Office of Management and Budget and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is part of the Defense Department—was over budget by $1 billion despite the fact that it was supposed to be a "high-tech" facility that would involve using state-of-the-art equipment.

– The Department of Housing and Urban Development has been ordered to hand over the names and Social Security numbers of people it has hired to run the nation's public housing programs, the Washington Post reports. The move comes after a Freedom of Information Act request by the nonprofit Center for American Progress revealed the identities of thousands of people who have been hired to run programs that provide housing for low-income Americans. The nonprofit says it has found more than 5,000 people with Social Security numbers that match people hired to run the programs, but the department has yet to hand over the names and Social Security numbers of those people. The Center for American Progress has filed a lawsuit against the department, accusing it of violating the Social Security Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act by not turning over the names and Social Security numbers of people hired to run programs that provide housing for low-income Americans.

– When Bank of America declared Chapter 11 last year, it left tens of thousands of its workers without pensions and millions of dollars in 401(k) accounts, the Wall Street Journal reports. Now the bank is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who say it violated federal law by giving millions in bonuses to top executives even after the bank filed for bankruptcy. The complaint alleges that Bank of America violated Section 206 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by giving millions in "unvested" deferred compensation to executives even after the bank filed for bankruptcy, the New York Times reports. The law requires companies that offer pensions to employees to set aside money for such payouts if the company goes bankrupt. But Bank of America says the law doesn't apply because it didn't file for bankruptcy until after the date of the law's enactment in 2009, the Journal notes. The suit, which accuses the company of "wrongful enrichment," claims that since the law requires companies to set aside money for payouts if they go bankrupt, the company is giving tens of thousands of dollars in bonuses to executives even after the company filed for bankruptcy, the Times reports. The suit also accuses the company of misleading investors about the law's benefits.
