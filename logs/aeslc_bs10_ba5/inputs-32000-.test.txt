FYI, John Grass and I spoke to Curt Hribernik this morning regarding various issues in the Master.
There has been a change in their corporate structure such that it appears they may have stronger financial backing or at the very least a change.
I requested they send documents reflecting ownership and name change.
Curt indicated they would be able to provide a LC.
I told him he and or his credit dept.
would need to discuss these issues with you before we could continue.

Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.
This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.
Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.
Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.
EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.
Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.
This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.
EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.
The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.
Please join me in supporting the efforts of Enron Principal Investments.

Dear Vince & Ozzie: For the Research support of the EAM organization, we were planning till recently for a team of 4 to 5 people for 2002.
Over the last four to five months, requests for our support have gone up, primarily for consumption risk, physical options and value-at-risk.
However, given the challenges we are facing now, I would like to reduce the Research staff for EAM to a core team of 3 people with a budget allocation of roughly $750,000.
Please note that this includes not only the salaries and bonuses, but also the overhead and other expenses as well.
The breakdown of the support levels for individual groups (with agreement from the group heads) is as follows: EAM Fundamentals (Steve Meyers) 0.4 FTE Curve and Model Development Group (Mauricio Quintana) Project Valuation Group (Steve Kromer) DSM Desk 0.6 FTE Pricing and Risk Premiums (Ravi Duggirala) DSM VAR and risk controls (Vladi Gorny) 0.5 FTE Consumption/SiteProfile Desk (Mallik AVS) 1.25FTE Consumption Premium Models Support for SiteProfile Issues (load shaping, asset profiling, etc.)
Other Short Term Requests 0.25FTE (Examples from last year: Insurance Model for Rick Jones, Business Assurance data analysis, etc.)
I would really appreciate if both of you can approve or provide your feedback on this.

Dear Mr. Lay, I went home yesterday along with the other 3,999 employees who lost their jobs at Enron.
Even though we had weeks to prepare for the worst, when the layoffs occurred, it really hit me hard.
I cried a great deal, not only about the uncertainty of my future, but for the loss of relationships and friendships that I had established over the last five years I spent at Enron.
The hardest aspect of yesterday was saying "goodbye" to my friends and co-workers.
We've all made a resolution to stay in touch and hopefully we will all pick up the pieces and carry on with our lives.
I appreciate the efforts that were made to get us some severance, but as you are well aware, gave so much of ourselves to the company and lost so much in return..
I'm sure I'm not alone in encouraging you and Enron management to continue to push for additional severance for those of us who lost our jobs.
This is a hard time to hit the street looking for a job, while Continential, Compaq and now Enron have downsized and the holidays are upon us.
I know you have probably received this kind of message many times in the last few weeks, but I hope you will continue to do the right thing for the employees.
We need the additional severance to be able to ensure food on the table and roofs over our heads until we can land on our feet after this free fall.
I will never regret my 5 years at Enron.
They are an important part of my past.
I appreciate your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,

In essence, the Court has again ruled that the patent is invalid for double patenting, but has used a different analysis to reach this conclusion.
We intend to seek legal review of today's decision.

The Agreement further specifies that the individuals elected to these positions may not be active in the same sector, nor may they be representatives of members that occupy the Chairperson or Vice Chairperson positions of the Business Issues Committee or Management Committee.

Here are my comments to the latest set of swap docs: 1.
In the swap assignment, I think that the definition of Regulated Subsidiary can be deleted.
2.
In Section 3.4 of the swap assignment, in the new language that was added at the very end, shouldn't it say after the words "Swap Agreement" "(as it relates to the Assigned Interest)"?
In other words, if these events as to Party B happen and it results in either an event of default or termination event under the swap, shouldn't Party A be entitled to terminate the Swap Agreement with respect to the portion that is not being assigned?
3.
I'm assuming that the changes to Section 3.5(e) track some current cross default language that Enron is now using.
4.
In Section 3.8, the word comments should be "consents".

Hello Mr. Kenneth Lay, I hope you don't mind an email from someone who is not very high in the decision-making level of Enron but I have such strong need to share my thoughts and visions with you.
First, I am so happy that we are not going to be acquired by Dynegy.
Enron is an entity that deserves to live on.
Second, I have a vision that we (Enron) become a "Wiser & Quieter" Enron.
I wish I can do something to help raise the "millions/billions" of dollars needed to survive in the shortrun, but all I can do is continue working on my project as I have done before....
I personally do not mind the company shrinking to a very modest level in the next 12-48 months, selling off core businesses, and adopting a more cautious role to ALL spending.
Even if we are layed-off we can always come back in the future.
Third, I just want to share an imagery of Enron being strong again in the future... Not with the previous ostentatiousness that prevailed in "the old days" but with a newly developed sense of Wisdom and Maturity.
...And there will be articles in the Wall Street Journal about how the Enron giant has slowly but consistently lifted itself out of the gutter to become a "Wiser & Quieter Enron".
If there is anything I can do to help you in this endeavor please let me know.
I have no strong family obligations that prevent me from working long hours on some additional short-term projects to help out my Enron.
Best Wishes!

Nancy Rivera-Brooks of the LA Times just called.
Said she'd heard that Ken Lay and Governor are in frequent talks discussing the possibility of Enron buying Edison's transmission system.
I told her that Enron is not in the market for transmission systems.
Next thing you know, we'll want to buy the nukes.
Best,

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.
Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.
The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.
However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.
I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Dan, When the superheater on stb.
boiler was inspected last night, 4 tubes were found sagged and with visible cracks on.
It looks like the tubes have been overheated.
The tubes had to be cut and plugged, but the first attempt failed as they found some leakage in the welding on the cutted tubes end when the superheater was pressure tested and they had to reweld the tubes end once more.
They are now placing some protection around the tubes end to avoid melting down the ends on the cutted tubes.
The vessel is expecting to have both boiler into service within 2 hrs.
We are not quite sure yet what has caused this cracks, but it looks like the tubes have been overheated, i.e rescriced flow of steam through the pipes.
The boiler will be examinated and closely investigate to establish the cause of the deformation of the tubes.
The tubes will also be sent to a metallurgist to get an anylyis of the material.
To rectifying the superheater the following arrangements have been done: - Turbo Technik will join vsl in LC with the following personnel: * One foreman * One boiler maker * One TIG welder - N.B.Reite will attend in LC - Boiler tubes, 14 pcs in 3 m lengths and tools/equipment will be forwarded to Freeport, Bahamas.
- Intend to repair super heater during passage to Algeciras/Suez - One Kongsberg technician will attend in LC for control system adjustment, if necessary.
This will give the following schedule: Etd Lake Charles June 10th pm Eta Freeport June 13th pm Eta Port Said July 2nd 1800lt ( abt 13 knots) Etd Suez July 3rd 1600lt Eta Qalhat July 9th 0600lt ( abt 18,5 knots) Reverting Best regards

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to "business as usual."
As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.
The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.
We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.
In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

Jeff, Just a brief note to thank you and your team for meeting with me during your busy trip to Boston last week.
Due to time constraints, we did not get a chance to talk at length about NYUonline, so FYI - I thought I would email you a brief overview of our group.
NYUonline is the "for profit" eLearning subsidiary of New York University, and we are a content and technology eLearning company.
On the content side, we work with the over 20 schools at New York University to bring their content online for the individual school's distance learning programs and then repurpose for our Fortune 1000, Government and other Higher Education customers worldwide.
On the technology side, we developed one of the industry's leading Learning Object Driven, and Scorm conformant (industry standard) Web Based Authoring/Publishing Tool that will be released commercially in May ("iAuthor").
The authoring tool enables Higher Education Institutions, Corporations and Governments to bring their content and knowledge online in the form of "Learning Objects".
The tool has received very strong marks from our colleagues in the higher education space (oxford, Stanford, uc Berkeley, uc Irvine, Princeton, Cornell, London school of economics, etc); as well as the corporate market.
In fact, one of the presentations we were having in Boston was to HBS's new interactive unit, and HBS's executive director - information technology group.
Thank you again for meeting with us, and you have an open invitation to join

As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization.
We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today.
Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along.
It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday.
Approval from the judge is expected.

Jason, I verbally confirmed the cut that occurred for gas day May 30th with Irene Isais of our Gas Transportation Services department.
Peoples ANR contract 104684 was cut by 6,599 MMBtu throughout the May 30th gas day.
The supply was cut because PGL Gas Supply was not told by Enron North America that the Northern Border supply @ Will County had been reallocated on different contracts.
All four GISB cycles were exercised in an attempt to receive the entire 40,000 but since the contract mismatch was not corrected until the final cycle, Peoples lost 6,599 MMBtu for the day.
Peoples reduced its SIQ purchase from 125,000 to 118,401 for gas day May 30th.

Should we get Greg and ENE OTC to send an email out today saying something like: In light of all of the recent extraordinary business matters that have been facing us we have held of launching the traditional year end PRC process.
Many of you will recall in our response to the lay it on the line survey we had announced several changes to this process primarily deigned to clarify the purpose of the PRC meetings and streamline the process.
However, given all that has happened in the last 3 weeks and all the critical business matters including the strategic review of our core and non-core businesses, we have concluded that it would be wise not to dictate we follow the previously announced guidelines.
Specifically, we will delegate to each of the business unit leads to decide whether they want to use the 360 PEP electronic feedback process and what form they would like to undertake any relative talent discussions.
Please look for further details and direction on the above from your BU lead in the next few days.
While we hope you understand that we need to make sure that we channel our efforts appropriately at this difficult time, we would want to make sure that everyone understands that: 1.
We will have a bonus process.
This will be conducted largely as in the past, but with a particular emphasis on those employees critical to business operations and ensuring our ability to successfully complete our proposed merger with Dynegy.
2.
If there is a rationalisation of headcount following our strategic business review of core and non-core, this will be conducted appropriately.
Our PRC process will not be the sole determinant in any such process, many other factors will be considered and as such this will be a separate process.
Need help with last 2 bullets!
Question is whether to send now or wait for another 3 weeks.
What d'ya think?
