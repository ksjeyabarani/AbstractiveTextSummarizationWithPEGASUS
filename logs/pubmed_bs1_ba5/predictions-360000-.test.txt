hypertension and heart failure are two of the most common comorbidities in the world . 
 the prevalence of hypertension among adults ages 18 years in 20052008 was 30.9% and was highest among persons ages 65 years ( 69.7% ) and non - hispanic blacks ( 44% ) . 
 the american heart association estimates that the incurred costs of hypertension are more than $ 93.5 billion per year , and that cardiovascular disease and stroke for which hypertension is the predominant risk factor , account for 17% of the total annual health expenditures in the united states . 
 hypertension and its sequelae , heart failure , are a progressive disease . 
 evidence shows that less than half of patients with heart failure survive five years ( after diagnosis ) , and less than a quarter of them live ten years after their initial diagnosis . 
 the overall u.s . 
 adults with hypertension have the highest rates ( 44% ) of hypertension in the world and are more resistant to treatment . 
 the relative incidence of heart failure is 50% higher in african americans , 3% of whom have heart failure , compared with 2% of the general population .

several chemoprotective properties of lycopene on prostate cancer have been proposed . 
 these mechanistic studies have stimulated the examination of lycopene and its primary source , tomato products , on risk of prostate cancer . 
 however , studies on lycopene and tomato product intake and prostate cancer incidence have yielded mixed results . 
 the study of this relationship has been complicated by unique and challenging epidemiologic considerations in the measurement of lycopene and on the influence of prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) screening on prostate cancer incidence and progression . as with all epidemiologic studies , 
 this paper briefly describes the methodology essential for conducting studies on the association between lycopene and prostate cancer incidence and provides an updated review of studies of lycopene and tomato products with prostate cancer risk .

disulfiram is a commonly prescribed drug for alcohol dependence . 
 disulfiram s major metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate is an inhibitor of dopamine - betahydroxylase , an enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of dopamine ( da ) to norepinephrine ( ne ) in the central nervous system . 
 by inhibiting this metabolic pathway from da to ne in the central nervous system , disulfiram results in an increase of da concentrations in mesolimbic system resulting in psychosis . 
 we present a case of 32-year - old male who developed psychosis with the use of disulfiram . 
 our case highlights the relevance of a careful history of patient s symptoms and family history that should be performed before starting treatment with disulfiram and caution should be taken while prescribing disulfiram for patients with personal and familial antecedents of psychosis .

protein phosphatases are a class of posttranslational modification proteins that have been identified as promising therapeutic targets . 
 the ubiquitously expressed protein phosphatase 2a ( pp2a ) is a serine / threonine phosphatase that recognizes a large number of substrates and mediates site - specific dephosphorylation . 
 the holoenzyme of pp2a is composed of a catalytic subunit ( c ) and one member of four families of regulatory subunits ( b ) . 
 the substrate specificity of pp2a is thought to be determined by the incorporation of a regulatory subunit into the ac dimer . 
 however , the exact substrate specificity of pp2a remains unclear . 
 recent studies have revealed that pp2a substrate specificity is conferred by a conserved docking motif that is found on all four b subunits and one regulatory subunit ( b55 ) . 
 this docking motif is also found on all four c subunits and one regulatory subunit ( pr72 ) . 
 the consensus sequence of the docking motif is not yet known , but it appears to be a combination of two discrete interactions , one with the c subunit and one with the b subunit .

 we report the case of a 66-year - old man in whom pulmonary hypertension and severe tricuspid regurgitation was diagnosed on technetium-99 m ( tc-99 m ) sulfur colloid bone marrow scan and single - photon emission computed tomography ( spect)/ct . 
 the planar gamma imaging showed a hepatosplenomegaly with increased tracer accumulation in the spleen , compatible with an increased hematopoietic activity resulting from an underlying myelofibrosis . 
 a moderate degree of tracer activity in a diffuse pattern was noted in both thoracic regions . 
 the spect / ct imaging confirmed the location of an increased thoracic tracer activity . 
 pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in patients with myelofibrosis .

etoposide - induced double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) during mitosis are very toxic to cells because of the induction of severe genomic instability . 
 two groups recently reported that the mechanism of etoposide - induced dsb suppression is dependent on the mitosis - specific phosphorylation of 53bp1 by cdk1 and on the phosphorylation of t198 by plk1 . 
 these findings suggest that the recruitment of rnf8 , rnf168 , 53bp1 , and brca1 to dsb sites is regulated by two distinct mechanisms . 
 these findings also suggest that the mechanism of etoposide - induced dsb suppression is not dependent on the phosphorylation of t198 by cdk1 . 
 in addition , these findings provide new insights into the role of pikks during mitosis and the mechanism of etoposide - induced dsb induction .

the cat retina is susceptible to a variety of degenerative diseases , including age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) . 
 although retinal transplantation has shown promise in the treatment of amd , effective treatments are lacking . 
 we previously isolated genetically modified feline neural progenitor cells ( cnpcs ) that were capable of integration into the retina of dystrophic feline recipients . 
 here we used a bicistronic feline lentiviral vector to generate feline npcs that exhibit sustained overexpression of glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( gdnf ) before and after differentiation . 
 expression of gdnf was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry . 
 gdnf - expressing cnpcs migrated extensively in the vitreous and were found to be present in the retina of dystrophic feline recipients . 
 gdnf - expressing cnpcs demonstrated a strong ability to secrete growth factors , including gdnf , into the vitreous . 
 in addition , cnpcs were found to be able to migrate into the retina following retinal detachment . 
 these results suggest that cnpcs derived from the feline eye may have the potential to be used as a sub

biliary hamartoma is a benign congenital malformation of the biliary duct which was described for the first time in 1918 by von mayenburg , therefore it is also called von mayenburg complex ( vmcs ) . 
 although jaundice and portal hypertension may arise as a result of mass effect , patients are usually asymptomatic . 
 biliary hamartomas may be single or multiple , with size ranging between 1 and 15 mm . 
 biliary hamartomas usually presents as multiple small nodules and despite the fact that they are rare , they may be confused with liver metastatic disease , microabscesses , diffuse primary hepatocellular carcinoma , biliary cysts or caroli s disease . 
 associating different imaging modalities with the follow - up are very useful in the diagnosis of biliary hamartoma .

extrahepatic portal venous obstruction ( ehpvo ) is the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in children and adults in developing countries . 
 ehpvo is usually treated with endoscopic therapy which has many advantages over surgery , but it has its own set of disadvantages . 
 endoscopic therapy is less invasive than surgery and requires fewer sessions and is less expensive . 
 it is also better than blood transfusion which is the mainstay of treatment in most centres . 
 the long - term outcome of endoscopic therapy is good , but it requires frequent follow - up and recurrence rates are high . 
 shunt surgery has been performed for the treatment of ehpvo for more than 50 years and has been shown to be a safe and effective method of treatment . 
 the results of shunt surgery in ehpvo are comparable to those of endoscopic therapy . 
 the role of endoscopic therapy in the treatment of ehpvo is evolving and is likely to become more popular as it has better outcomes and is less expensive .

dietary sugar intake , in the form of sucrose or high - fructose corn syrup ( hfcs ) , has dramatically increased and correlates with a rise in obesity , metabolic syndrome , and diabetes . 
 although the mechanisms of sugar addiction are still a subject of controversy , many studies have demonstrated that sugar intake might be associated with alterations in gut hormone levels , gut permeability , and blood brain barrier . 
 in addition , several studies have suggested that the brain might be the main target of dietary sugars , since the hedonic value of food is closely linked to the sensory perception of food and the reward value of food might override the physiological mechanisms related to energy homeostasis . 
 the hedonic value of highly palatable foods and their wide availability can override the physiological mechanisms related to energy homeostasis . 
 both drugs and food have powerful reinforcing effects partly mediated by dopamine increases in the limbic system that , under certain circumstances or in vulnerable individuals , could overwhelm the brain s homeostatic control mechanisms , but the plausibility of sugar addiction and its role in obesity and eating disorders in humans is still a subject of controversy . 
 this review focuses on the evidence on the effects of dietary sugars on

background conserved domains in proteins are important for many cellular processes . 
 many groups have attempted to find , document and annotate these conserved domains . 
 this study investigates how five eukaryotic genomes maintain conserved domains.methods conserved domains were identified in 519 proteins in homo sapiens , drosophila melanogaster , arabidopsis thaliana , caenorhabditis elegans and saccharomyces cerevisiae . 
 data were collected from the smart cd database , a database of conserved domains in proteins , and from a repository of databases ( pad ) . 
 results were confirmed using a database from this group ( smart).results for many conserved domains , the ratio of the sum of genes in genome 1 containing the conserved domain to the sum genes in genome 2 was proportional to the ratio of the sum of genes in genome 1 containing the conserved domain to the total number of predicted genes in genome 2 . 
 this suggests that these conserved domains are maintained in this ratio as a result of functional constraints on interacting domains.conclusions this study provides a useful dataset for analyzing how genomes maintain any given domain in relation to other conserved domains , as well as for analyzing the relationship of conserved domain occurrence to

the three lincosamides , lincomycin , clindamycin , and pirlimycin , are clinically important antibiotics used against a wide range of bacteria . 
 lincosamides block bacterial protein synthesis , which takes place on the ribosomes . 
 however , extensive use of these antibiotics has led to increased resistance in many strains of bacteria , which have been developing various mechanisms to counter these drugs . 
 one known mechanism is structural modification of the drug s target ( ribosome ) through the methylation of 23s rna ( e.g. , base no . 
 2058 ) and/or mutations ( e.g. , of bases g2057 , a2058 , c2452 , and c2611 ) . 
 other mechanisms of resistance are active efflux of the drug across the cell surface , or its enzymatic deactivation . 
 bacterial resistance together with side effects are the most important reasons for improving known lincosamides and designing modified compounds . 
 the conformational properties of free clindamycin and lincomycin have been studied using x - ray techniques as well as 1

angiogenesis is a main mechanism of vascularization during embryonic development , growth , formation of the corpus luteum and endometrium , regeneration and wound healing . 
 however , deregulated , abnormal angiogenesis is involved in many pathological processes . 
 the relationships of angiogenesis with cancer have special relevance , since angiogenesis has been described as one of the hallmarks of cancer , playing an essential role in tumour growth , invasion , and metastasis . 
 since tumour blood vessels show many differences from normal vessels and are not genetically unstable , they are potential targets for therapy of all types of cancer . due to the pivotal role played by endothelial cells in tumour angiogenesis , 
 most previous efforts were devoted to the development of agents that could block their activation by an angiogenic signal ( mainly vegf ) , or to inhibit one or several specific functions of activated endothelial cells ( proliferation , adhesion to extracellular matrix , proteolytic activities , migration , invasion or differentiation ) . 
 the great number of angiogenesis inhibitors described so far , and the interesting results obtained in experimental models , even showing complete tumour regressions in pre - clinical studies , even showed modest or even negative results emerged from

prostate cancer ( pca ) is the second most common neoplasia in men worldwide . 
 epidemiological studies have revealed that the incidence of pca is reduced in population with food rich in isoflavones . 
 many studies have demonstrated that isoflavones exert hormone - like effects and nonhormone - like effects involving inhibiting tyrosine kinases , modulation of cell proliferation , regulation of cell cycle , apoptosis , angiogenesis , and tumor cell metastasis , and our recent study found isoflavones induced autophagy cell death by up - regulation of ulk1 level . 
 many randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) about the role of isoflavones in men with pca have been developed ; however , these results are inconsistent . 
 the main mechanisms involve binding competitively er- and er- , regulation of sex steroid hormonal synthesis and secretion , down - regulation of ar gene expression , and inhibition of prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) secretion . 
 these possible mechanisms include antioxidant defense , dna repair , inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis , potentiation of radio- and chemo - therapeutic agents , and antagonism of estrogen- and androgen

point - of - care testing ( poct ) is an increasingly popular means of delivering laboratory tests close to the patient . 
 laboratory directors should know our processes and take steps to detect and prevent errors before those mistakes reach the clinician and affect patient care . 
 risk management is a way to reduce errors with poct . 
 risk is the chance of suffering harm or loss , and risk can also apply to the operator of the poct device , the laboratory administration and even the hospital and its reputation . 
 errors that occur more frequently have greater risk , and errors that lead to greater harm also present greater risk . 
 when errors are detected , the harm to patients is estimated and actions are taken to prevent recurrence in the future . 
 so , risk management is simply a formal term for many of the activities that laboratories are already doing . 
 quality control is a means of detecting and preventing errors . 
 liquid controls are analyzed at two concentration levels each day of testing or more frequently as required by the stability of the test system . 
 traditional quality control , however , does a poor job at detecting random errors which uniquely affect individual samples .

the 
 life span of nuclear waste is extended by > 60 years , 
 and the waste contains long - lived radionuclides that must be contained 
 and isolated from future populations . 
 an engineered barrier 
 concept proposed for deep geological disposal facilities ( gdf ) 
 is intended to retard the release of radioactive species from the 
 waste . 
 however , the mobility and solubility of radionuclides 
 within the gdf are not well understood . 
 a key methodological step remains : 
 the extraction of quantitative geochemical information from image data . 
 
 we have used a combination of visible light transmission and fluorescence 
 imaging , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , and x - ray computed tomography 
 ( xct ) to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of geochemistry

the normal pregnancy immune response is critical to the health of the fetus and mother . 
 changes in the maternal immune response during pregnancy can be studied using multiplex cytokine arrays , but longitudinal studies are lacking . 
 we used multiplex arrays to evaluate the longitudinal changes in 42 cytokines in a cohort of 16 healthy primigravid women . 
 we found that the cytokine profile changed little between the first and second trimesters of pregnancy , but did show a consistent increase in activity throughout the course of pregnancy . 
 we also found that the proinflammatory interleukin ( il)-6 and anti - inflammatory il-10 were the most consistently elevated cytokines throughout pregnancy . 
 we used unconditional growth modeling to determine within - subject correlation between repeated measurements and the changes in cytokine levels . 
 the results of this study provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of the normal pregnancy immune response .

the data revolution in healthcare is an offshoot of the vast amount of digital medical information that has now accumulated in electronic medical records . 
 the vision is for a population data - driven knowledge system that generalizes from every patient s life , disease and treatment experiences to impute the best course of action for diagnosis , prognosis and treatment of future patients . 
 the challenge is the transformation of the copious data into usable and useful medical knowledge . 
 clinicians must already make sense of a diverse variety of data input streams in order to make clinical decisions . 
 data from everyday activities ( financial transactions , cellphone and internet use , social media posts ) , the environment , and even the local government promise to provide even more clinically relevant information , but to what end ? and how can increasing amounts of data be incorporated into a system of already overburdened clinicians?this paper will discuss the general issue of data in critical care with a focus on the big data phenomenon that is sweeping healthcare .
