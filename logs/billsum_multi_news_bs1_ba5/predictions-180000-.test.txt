A federal judge in Texas ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional on the eve of the next year's sign-up deadline for the health care law. (AP) A federal judge in Texas ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional on the eve of the next year's sign-up deadline for the health care law. (AP) This decision by the district court in Texas provides the legal framework for states to challenge theAffordable Care Act (ACA) as unconstitutional and establishes a new legal standard for reviewing such lawsuits. It also establishes the legal standard for congressional Republicans to follow if theACA is declared unconstitutional. The ruling by U.S. District Court Reed O'Connor in Texas is a potential roadmap to the Supreme Court in a case involving the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). If the court subsequently upholds PPACA, the government will have to replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the court will apply the standard for subsequent ratification of the Act.

Irish Parliament passed a limited abortion rights bill in Ireland on Saturday, allowing a woman to terminate a pregnancy only when her life is under threat or if she is suicidal. The bill amends the Irish Constitution and the Irish laws that govern the state to limit the termination of a pregnancy to when a woman is under threat, or if a pregnancy is at risk of death unless she dies as a result of a physical disorder, illness, or injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. It makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly provide for an abortion knowing that the person is under threat of death or otherwise being denied or refused care due to a pregnancy's risk of death or otherwise being denied care because of the pregnancy. The bill also imposes penalties on a person who knowingly or recklessly violates the prohibition. It makes it unlawful for any person who participates in an abortion service to knowingly pay any impermissible fee or to use the services of an abortion service provider unless the woman is informed in writing of the penalty and is informed at the time of the abortion that the penalty is imposed. The bill also prohibits any medical or mental health disorder, injury, or illness being the proximate cause of the pregnancy's death.
