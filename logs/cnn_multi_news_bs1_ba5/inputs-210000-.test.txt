Think back, everyone -- can you remember when you first fell in love with actress Melissa McCarthy? I never saw her TV show, Mike & Molly. So for me it was her role in Bridesmaids. I thought the whole ensemble was hilarious, but Melissa's uttlerly balls-to-the-wall weird and highly original character had me in helpless fits, tears streaming down my face. She stole the show, as far as I'm concerned. 
 
 I haven't seen her new movie, Identity Thief, yet. I'll probably read a few reviews first. But one reviewer whose opinion I'm totally disregarding is Rex Reed's. In his New York Observer review, he attacked Melissa for her weight. He actually did that, like that is something a professional film reviewer just does. Wait until you read what he said. It's infuriating.

 IDENTITY THIEF  ⁇  
 
 (1/4 stars) Written by: Craig Mazin 
 
 Directed by: Seth Gordon 
 
 Starring: Jason Bateman, Melissa McCarthy and John Cho 
 
 Running time: 111 min. 
 
 In the trashy, stupefying screenplay by Craig Mazin, Jason Bateman is a Denver accountant named Sandy Patterson—another in a long line of victims of the increasingly dangerous world of cyber-crime—whose credit card has been hacked and copied by a felonious thief in Miami (cacophonous, tractor-sized Melissa McCarthy). Now there are two Sandy Pattersons—an innocent fraud victim on one side of the country facing bankruptcy and a screeching, humongous creep on a marathon shopping spree on the other side of the country who is running up thousands of dollars in charges and wrecking her victim’s credit rating in the process. The police do nothing, the male Sandy loses his job and faces jail time, and the only solution is to devise a plan to apprehend the fake, female Sandy and drag her from Florida back to Colorado to turn herself in and clear his good name. In order to stretch a five-minute idea into 107 minutes of contrived drivel some people may mistake for plot, the plan backfires. She beats him up, steals his wallet, wrecks his rental car and leaves him stranded on the highway in a pair of pants stolen from a dead hobo. With no identification or money, he gets arrested for assaulting an officer, drug dealing and illegal gun possession. And still, against all odds, they hit the road to Colorado pursued by killers, bounty hunters and “skip tracers,” who track down crooks who owe money to gangsters, jump parole and get involved in other intrigues invented by hack Hollywood screenwriters. The snafus in the worst road movie since The Guilt Trip plunge Mr. Bateman and his female hippo into a motel with only a double bed, a grotesque sex scene with a pickled reprobate she picks up in a bar who demands a threesome, a violent bar fight that bloodies his nose, a kidnapping, a multi-car collision going the wrong way on the freeway ... but why go on? They seem to be making it up as they go along, in a movie that threatens never to end. 
 
 By the time they got lost in the woods and fall into a den of hissing snakes, Elvis has long since left the building. Melissa McCarthy (Bridesmaids) is a gimmick comedian who has devoted her short career to being obese and obnoxious with equal success. Poor Jason Bateman. How did an actor so charming, talented, attractive and versatile get stuck in so much dreck? Identity theft is a real plague that is happening so often that people tremble every time they approach an ATM. It’s a deserving subject that should be explored in a more viable film, but Identity Thief is so bad it’s hard to believe it wasn’t directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers. ||||| 'Identity Thief' review: A case of fraud MOVIE REVIEW

'Alien: Covenant': Film Review 
 
 Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup lead the ensemble of Ridley Scott's second installment in the 'Alien' prequel series. 
 
 There's life in the old bugger yet. And, as always, plenty of death. After the Alien series looked as though it had hit the rocks creatively (not for the first time) with the last entry, Prometheus, five years ago, savvy old master Ridley Scott has resuscitated it, and then some, with Alien: Covenant, the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two. 
 
 Gripping through its full two hours and spiked with some real surprises, this beautifully made sci-fi thriller will immeasurably boost fan interest in the run of prequels which Scott has recently said will consist of at least two more films until the action catches up to the 1979 original. This Fox release is a lock for major early summer box-office worldwide. 
 
 Is there a director who has ever been artistically committed to a franchise as long as Scott has to the Alien series? None comes to mind (Steven Spielberg made his first Indiana Jones adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark, in 1981, two years after Alien was released). It's a matter of record that Scott will turn 80 later this year, and Clint Eastwood will be 87 when he starts his new film; from the evidence on the screen, 80 may well be the new 50 where some top helmers are concerned, especially those who, like Scott and Eastwood, make a new film almost every year. 
 
 It also helped to recruit a couple of very good writers, John Logan and Dante Harper, to dig the series out of its hole. No matter that these aliens have been around far longer than most of the viewers who will see this film opening weekend have been alive; this entry feels vital, freshly thought out and keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow. 
 
 The elegantly spare opening, in which a “synthetic,” Walter (Michael Fassbender), engages his “father” (an uncredited Guy Pearce) in a pointedly philosophical conversation, simply and effectively frames the thrust of the film's central interest in human life's origins and its prospects for survival. Casual viewers may assume that Walter is the same character Fassbender played in Prometheus. But, no, Walter, who sports an American, not British, accent, is an updated version of that all-purpose butler, factotum and technical wizard — a far friendlier iteration of the know-it-all computer Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey. 
 
 And as in 2001, Alien: Covenant involves a long outer space voyage during which the 2,000 human passengers, along with 1,140 embryos, will linger in a deep-freeze sleep for several years while the humanoid plays watchdog. The giant ship, called Covenant, is headed for a very distant planet, Origae-6, which is considered a promising new home for humanity to settle. For this reason, not only the slumbering immigrants, but the crew, too, are composed of prospective parents meant to propagate and establish a new homeland for homo sapiens. 
 
 This couples-only orientation lends a fresh feel to this group of space travelers, and definitely cranks up the emotional distress quotient as partners start splitting open and giving birth to the wrong kind of offspring. When a space storm hits and damages the ship's giant wind sails, the first to perish is the ship's captain (James Franco, seen ever-so-briefly), which devastates his mate Daniels (Katherine Waterston), assigned to oversee terraforming on humankind's new planet. 
 
 This accident promotes second-in-command Christopher (Billy Crudup) to run the show, but he's portrayed from the outset as uncertain and lacking in confidence; more than that, he's a “person of faith,” which puts him at great philosophical odds with most of the others. Unfortunately, once this element is introduced, the writers don't do much with it, so it feels like a missed opportunity to engage in some pithy religion vs. science debate. Worse, the character's overriding weakness as a man won't go over too well with faith-based audiences. 
 
 Not only that, but when the crew discovers a nearby “hidden planet” that seems potentially compatible to human life, it's Christopher who makes the fateful decision to land there rather than to continue with their seven-year-long voyage. Farris (Amy Seimetz), the flier wife of the Covenant's main pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride), goes down for a peek and it looks pretty darn good, just like New Zealand, in fact, where half the world wants to move to right now. 
 
 But as inviting as are the

 Charlie Hebdo 
 
 PARIS - France said it would temporarily close its embassies and schools in 20 countries on Friday after a French magazine published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, a move it fears will further inflame tensions over a film mocking the prophet."We have indeed decided as a precautionary measure to close our premises, embassies, consulates, cultural centers and schools," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said of the shut-down on Friday, prayer day across the Muslim world.The French satirical weekly published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad on Wednesday, a move criticized by the French authorities which sent riot police to protect the magazine's offices.In response, Muslim leaders criticized the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad as another Western insult to their faith and urged France's government to take firm action against it."We reject and condemn the French cartoons that dishonor the Prophet and we condemn any action that defames the sacred according to people's beliefs," the acting head of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, Essam Erian, said.Issues of the magazine hit newsstands with a front cover showing an Orthodox Jew pushing a turbaned figure in a wheelchair with several caricatures of the Prophet on its inside pages, including some of him naked.The front page cartoon had the wheelchair-bound figure saying "You mustn't mock" under the headline "Untouchable 2", a reference to a hugely popular French movie about a paralyzed rich white man and his black assistant.The publication came amid widespread outrage over a short film, made with private funds in the United States, that mocks the Prophet and has ignited days of sometimes deadly protests in the Arab world, Africa, Asia and some Western countries.French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius criticized the move as a provocation and said he had ordered security beefed up at French diplomatic offices in the Muslim world.Charlie Hebdo's Paris offices were fire bombed last November after it published a mocking caricature of Mohammad. In 2005, Danish cartoons of the Prophet sparked a wave of violent protests across the Muslim world that killed at least 50 people.Many Muslims consider any representation of Allah or the Prophet Mohammad offensive."Is it relevant and intelligent in this environment to add fuel to the fire? The answer is no," Fabius told France Info radio. "I'm very worried... and when I saw this I immediately issued instructions for special security precautions to be taken in all the countries where it could be a problem."The government has called for restraint over the cartoons, restating the principles of free speech in France and urging those shocked by the images to take action through the courts.Muslim leaders in France, which has Europe's largest Muslim population, have appealed for calm.As outrage over the anti-Muslim film continues to fuel violence and protests across the Islamic world, French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the authorities had rejected a request to hold a march against the film in Paris."There is no reason for us to allow conflicts that do not concern France to enter our country," Ayrault told RTL radio.Social media had circulated calls for a protest on Saturday against the film, after police arrested about 150 people who tried to take part in an unauthorized protest near the US Embassy in Paris last week. ||||| A FRENCH satirical magazine has published nude cartoons of Prophet Mohammed, a move that could further inflame tensions after violent protests in the Muslim world over an anti-Islam film. 
 
 The cover of Charlie Hebdo today shows a Muslim in a wheelchair being pushed by an Orthodox Jew under the title Intouchables 2, referring to an award-winning French film about a poor black man who helps an aristocratic quadriplegic. 
 
 Another cartoon on the back page of the weekly magazine shows a naked turbaned Mohammed exposing his posterior to a film director, a scene inspired by a 1963 film starring French film star Brigitte Bardot. 
 
 Charlie Hebdo's website crashed today after being bombarded with comments that ranged from hate mail to approbation. 
 
 The magazine is no stranger to controversy over issues relating to Islam. 
 
 Last year it published an edition ''guest-edited'' by Prophet Mohammed that it called Sharia Hebdo. 
 
 The magazine's offices in Paris were subsequently fire-bombed. 
 
 French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said anyone offended by cartoons could take the matter to the courts after expressing his 'disapproval of all excesses''. 
 
 But he emphasised France's tradition of free speech. 
 
 ''We are in a country where freedom of expression is guaranteed, including the freedom to caricature,'' he said on RTL radio. 
 
 ''If people really feel offended in their beliefs and think there has been an infringement of the law - and we are in a state where laws must be totally respected - they can go to court,'' Ayrault said. 
 
 He also said a request to hold a demonstration in

Another 2012 Republican candidate’s attempt at making sweet music has appeared on the internet, and it’s a doozy– introducing Sunday Morning*, a gospel album recorded by former Godfather’s Pizza CEO Herman Cain. Precious little is know about the 13-track album, which appeared on the internet today, but the soulful baritone crooning is certainly worth a listen. 
 
 Cain had certainly not mentioned anything about a past life as a gospel singer, but a few tracks off of Sunday Morning made their way online today via the Daily Caller. It’s mostly standard gospel fare and mostly slow tracks at that, with one standout single: “This is the Day,” a fast-paced track reminiscent of “Footloose” that certainly wins the prize for funnest danceable track on the album. 
 
 It is worth noting that it not yet 100% certain this is Herman Cain– Dave Weigel notes that the Cain campaign has yet to comment on the album, but “it’s real, it was published 15 years ago by GLC Music, Selah Sound Production & Melodic Praise Records, and it is not being distributed now by the Cain campaign.” With McCotter on guitar, Cain on vocals and maybe some keytar work by Jon Huntsman, we’ve got ourselves a band!

The estranged wife of acclaimed concert pianist Vadym Kholodenko has been ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial for allegedly killing the couple's two young daughters by smothering them with pillows. 
 
 Sofya Tsygankova has been ordered committed by a Texas judge to a state mental health facility for 120 days of treatment with the hope that she will be able to face justice when she regains "a reasonable degree of rational understanding," court records revealed Wednesday.

 Tsygankova, who is 32 and charged with two counts of capital murder of a person under age 10, will remain in the Tarrant County jail until a bed becomes available at the mental health facility. 
 
 Prosecutors raised no objections to state Judge Ruben Gonzalez's order, which was signed on Monday. 
 
 Tsygankova has pleaded not guilty to charges of killing daughters Nika, 5, and Michaela, 1, at their Benbrook, Texas home. 
 
 Kholodenko, 30, is a Ukrainian musician whose critically-acclaimed career took off after he won the gold medal at the 14th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 2013. 
 
 Police said that when the pianist arrived at his wife's home March 17 to pick up the girls and take them to preschool, he found Tsyganova covered in blood with cuts on her wrists and the two children dead in their beds. 
 
 Tsygankova had visited a state mental health facility in Fort Worth a day before her daughters were found dead, The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. 
 
 Inside the home, police found an empty prescription bottle of quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug used to treat such mental illnesses as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, the paper reported. 
 
 Kholodenko resumed playing concerts a month after his girls were killed. 
 
 "In this time of extreme loss and sorrow, I must look to music which has been so important in my life, and through which I can express myself," he said in a statement. "I ask those who will attend my concerts to also focus on the music. I continue to be grateful for those who are sending support from all over the world." ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The following article, which has provoked much criticism, should have included acknowledgment of the serious nature and number of allegations that had been made against the writer, Jian Ghomeshi. In October 2014, Ghomeshi—about whom multiple women had filed harassment complaints—was fired from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation after executives saw evidence that he had caused physical harm to a woman. Shortly after, more than twenty women accused him of sexual abuse and harassment, which included hitting, biting, choking, and verbal abuse during sex. Many of these allegations were made in respected publications, including The Toronto Star. That November, Ghomeshi was charged with the sexual assault of three women. (Sexual assault, under Canada’s Criminal Code, can include threats and nonconsensual physical contact. There is no specific legal provision for rape as it is defined in US law.) In January 2015, additional counts of sexual assault were brought against him by three more women. He was acquitted of all charges, and settled a further charge of sexual assault, of a coworker at the CBC, out of court with a peace bond and public apology. Substantial space will be devoted to letters responding to this article in the next issue of The New York Review, dated October 25, 2018. 
 
 Not so long ago, I spoke to hundreds of thousands of listeners across North America every day on a public radio show. These days, the closest I come to public performance is at a neighborhood karaoke bar in New York. Even that can have its perils. One night last year, I was waiting my turn to sing when a woman spotted my name on the list. “Jian!” she said to me. “Your name is Jian? Ha! Hey, you know who ruined that name for you?” “No. Who?” I said, bracing myself. For the first time, she looked straight at me—and stopped smiling. 
 
 For her, it was like one of those excruciating moments when you accidentally include the butt of a joke in a reply-all e-mail. For me, it was just another day in the life of the notorious Jian. She apologized and said all the right things. And I said all the right things back. (“How could you have known?”) Mostly I felt bad because she felt bad. But then we rallied and sang a duet together. And then we became friends and are regularly in touch. Chalk up one more human being who no longer thinks I’m a creep. 
 
 Here’s the thing about being an erstwhile “celebrity” who is now an outcast: You’re not just feeling sorry for yourself. You’re also feeling sorry for everyone around you—sometimes even the strangers.

 A day after the announcement of Buruma’s departure from the literary magazine, the NYRB itself has yet to give an explanation for the rift with its chief editor – only the third person to hold the top post since the review was founded in 1963. The silence means Buruma has got his side of the story out first, portraying himself as a victim of social media bullying. 
 
 New York Review of Books editor Ian Buruma departs amid outrage over essay Read more 
 
 In an interview with the Dutch magazine Vrij Nederland, the writer and academic said he had been “convicted on Twitter, without any due process”. He characterized his fate as “rather ironic”. 
 
 “As editor of the New York Review of Books I published a theme issue about #MeToo-offenders who had not been convicted in a court of law but by social media. And now I myself am publicly pilloried.” 
 
 The storm that toppled Buruma from one of the most prestigious journalistic seats in America erupted this month when he published a long article by the former Canadian broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi. The celebrity was acquitted in March, 2016, of sexual assault and choking relating to three women. 
 
 At least a further 17 other women have also made serious allegations of improper sexual conduct against Ghomeshi. Yet in the essay, Ghomeshi tried to defend himself against the accusations, saying they were “inaccurate”. 
 
 Ghomeshi said he wanted to give a more “nuanced” view of what had happened. 
 
 The article prompted furious debate on social media and widespread criticism of Buruma’s decision to publish on the grounds that, though Ghomeshi had been acquitted, he remained subject to multiple claims of violent behavior from many women. The dispute was aggravated when

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A group of divers has connected two underwater caverns in eastern Mexico to reveal what is believed to be the biggest flooded cave on the planet, a discovery that could help shed new light on the ancient Maya civilization. 
 
 The Gran Acuifero Maya (GAM), a project dedicated to the study and preservation of the subterranean waters of the Yucatan peninsula, said the 347-km (216-mile) cave was identified after months of exploring a maze of underwater channels. 
 
 Near the beach resort of Tulum, the group found that the cave system known as Sac Actun, once measured at 263 km, communicated with the 83-km Dos Ojos system, the GAM said in a statement. For that reason, Sac Actun now absorbs Dos Ojos. 
 
 GAM director and underwater archaeologist Guillermo de Anda said the “amazing” find would help to understand the development of the rich culture of the region, which was dominated by the Maya civilization before the Spanish conquest. 
 
 “It allows us to appreciate much more clearly how the rituals, the pilgrimage sites and ultimately the great pre-Hispanic settlements that we know emerged,” he told Reuters. 
 
 The Yucatan peninsula is studded with monumental relics of the Maya people, whose cities drew upon an extensive network of sinkholes linked to subterranean waters known as cenotes. 
 
 Some cenotes acquired particular religious significance to the Maya, whose descendents continue to inhabit the region. ||||| Explore the World's Largest Underwater Cave 
 
 
 
 Click here to read World's Largest Underwater Cave Discovered. January 17, 2018 - The world's longest underwater cave has been discovered near the city of Tulum, on Mexico's Yucat ⁇ n Peninsula. The new discovery connects two previously known flooded caves into one 215-mile-long stretch. The cave holds an important large fresh water reserve that supports great biodiversity. Hundreds of archaeological sites exist in the cave, including evidence of America's first settlers, Mayan culture, and extinct animals. 
 
 Last Wednesday, after ten months of work, the Underwater Exploration Group of the Great Maya Aquifer Project (GAM) found a connection between two of the most extensive flooded cavern systems on Earth—Sac Actun and Dos Ojos, both in Mexico's Yucat ⁇ n Peninsula—now forming the world's largest known flooded cave, with a length of 215 miles. 
 
 "This immense cave represents the most important submerged archaeological site in the world, since it has more than a hundred archaeological contexts, among which is evidence of the first settlers of America, as well as the extinct fauna and, of course, of the Maya culture," says Guillermo de Anda, a National Geographic explorer and director of the GAM. 
 
 This phase of the project began in March 2017 with the work of GAM director of exploration Robert Schmittner and a team of divers specialized in caves. Schmittner had been looking for this connection for 14 years and adding new mapped tunnels and galleries to this water labyrinth. 
 
 So far, the 167-mile-long Ox Bel Ha System, located south of Tulum, Mexico, was the longest. The Sac Actun System, located northeast of Tulum, was ranked second, at about 163 miles. 
 
 The third on the list was the Koal Baal System, with 57 miles; and the fourth, the Dos Ojos System, with 52 miles. Now, as a result of the exhaustive exploration, the latter is added to the Sac Actun System. 
 
 According to the rules of caving, when two cave systems are connected, the largest cave absorbs the smallest, so the name of the latter disappears. 
 
 The next goal will be to connect Sac Actun with the other three underwater cave systems, which are very close to each other and located in the municipality of Tulum. 
 
 According to data from the Quintana Roo Speleological Survey, there are 358 submerged cave systems in the north of the state, which represents nearly 870 miles of flooded passages of fresh water. 
 
 "The Mother of All Cenotes" 
 
 As a result of this same search, the exploration group of GAM has registered another important system with a length of 11 miles, until now called "the mother of all cenotes." It has a maximum depth of 65 feet and is located north of Sac Actun. From what is known so far, it is an individual system, but the team of explorers may be able to connect it to Sac Actun as well. 
 
 "This is an effort of more than 20 years of traveling hundreds of kilometers of caves submerged in Quintana Roo mainly, of which I devoted 14 to explore this monstrous Sac Actun System. Now, everyone's job is to keep it [up]," says Schmittner.

It was unclear what the heart was intended for and whether anyone's life was ever in danger. But the organ was supposed to be left in Seattle. 
 
 BREAKING, 12:33 p.m., Thursday: We now know where Seattle’s airborne heart was headed after the Dallas-bound flight was turned around. 
 
 On Sunday afternoon, a Southwest Airlines flight bound for Dallas made a hairpin turn over eastern Idaho and headed back for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The reason, the captain told passengers: Someone forgot to unload a human heart. 
 
 Dr. Andrew Gottschalk recalled that his fellow passengers went through a series of reactions to the news, the first shock. A human heart being transported on a commercial carrier? But the next reaction was of kindness because everyone on board “was happy to save a life,” he said. 
 
 The captain went on to explain that the heart should have been left in Seattle after an earlier flight from Sacramento. 
 
 Then horror sank in, Gottschalk said, as some passengers with an internet connection began to research how long a heart could be viable for a transplant — mere hours. 
 
 Southwest confirmed that the flight had to return to Seattle on Sunday afternoon after officials realized the plane was still carrying the heart intended for delivery to a hospital. 
 
 But additional details, including its intended destination and what it was being used for, remain unclear. Also unknown is whether anyone’s life was ever in danger. 
 
 Southwest flight 3606 landed at Sea-Tac after about three hours in the air, and the “life-critical cargo shipment” was unloaded from the plane, Southwest spokesman Dan Landson said by email. He added that Southwest made the decision to return because it was “absolutely necessary to deliver the shipment to its destination in the Seattle area as quickly as possible.” 
 
 “Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers and the safe delivery of the precious cargo we transport every day,” Landson said. 
 
 The sender was a company that specializes in shipments that are “life critical,” which can mean organs for transplant, medications or specimens for treatments, said Southwest, which did not provide the name of the company. 
 
 But no Seattle-area hospitals said they were involved. Spokeswomen for regional organ-procurement organizations in Washington and California both said they never use commercial flights for heart transplants. 
 
 “We only use private flights,” said Katherine Pliska, spokeswoman for LifeCenter Northwest, the organization that facilitates the transfer of organs for transplant in the region. “There’s a time limit to get where it needs to go.” 
 
 Southwest and many other airlines work with companies that ship organs for transplants, among other perishables such as human remains, to maximize revenue, though it accounts for less than 1 percent of Southwest’s total revenue, the Dallas Business Journal reported last year. Other parts of a heart, such as heart valves and vessels, can be recovered when a whole heart transplant isn’t feasible, according to LifeCenter Northwest.

Jaguar exhibit at LR Zoo (Photo: THV11) Story Highlights A 3-year-old reportedly fell into jaguar exhibit at LR Zoo. 
 
 One zoo staffer is said to have held the cats back with a fire extinguisher while another got the boy out. 
 
 The boy's condition is unknown at this time. 
 
 LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (KTHV) – THV11 has some good news to share after a 3-year-old fell into the cat exhibit at Little Rock Zoo. 
 
 The Arkansas Children's Hospital released a statement Saturday morning, saying that the child is "stable and is expected to improve." 
 
 On Friday, the 3-year-old child was being treated for extensive scalp lacerations, a depressed skull fracture, and minor puncture wounds. Lt. Sidney Allen with the Little Rock Police Department told THV11 that whether the puncture wounds came from the fall or one of the animals in the exhibit was not known, but doctors did say that the wounds were not life-threatening. 
 
 More details have come out about the incident earlier Friday at the Little Rock Zoo. 
 
 According to the police report, the child fell approximately 15-16 feet into a cat exhibit at the Little Rock Zoo late Friday morning. A primate zoo keeper made the initial call to emergency services after hearing people screaming for help; she told police that she ran over to the exhibit and saw one of the jaguars with its mouth around the little boy's neck.

 The father and grandfather told police that they both saw the child's feet go over the railing out of their peripheral vision, according to the report. The father ran to get help and returned to throw items at the cats to keep them at bay—one ran off and didn't return while other circled back and reportedly bit the child on the back of the neck. The report indicated that the father threw something else at the cat and got it to release. 
 
 Shortly afterward, more zoo workers arrived. The report shows that one worker arrived with a fire extinguisher to keep the animals away while another climbed into the exhibit with a ladder to get the child out. According to Captain Weaver with the Little Rock Fire Department, the little boy was reportedly out of the enclosure by the time the fire department arrived. 
 
 John Swanson with MEMS said an ambulance was posted in the zoo area, so they were able to respond to the scene in two minutes and transport the child to the hospital in three minutes.

 "Yesterday a child was transported to Arkansas Children's Hospital for treatment of injuries sustained in a fall at the Little Rock Zoo. The child's condition has been upgraded to stable and is expected to improve," said director of communications for Arkansas Children's Hospital Dan McFadden. "We respect the wishes of the child's guardian who asked that the child's name and any additional information not be shared at this time. Thank you for respecting the privacy of this family." 
 
 Children's Hospital asked THV not to come to the hospital after the zoo incident. We are respecting that request for both them %26 the family. — Shayla Teater (@thvshayla) October 10, 2014 
 
 Little Rock Zoo spokesperson Susan Altrui released this complete statement from the City of Little Rock that stated: 
 
 A child fell into the jaguar exhibit at the Little Rock Zoo and has sustained injuries. At around 10:45 a.m. Zoo staff arrived at the jaguar exhibit and found that a toddler had fallen into the enclosure. Zoo staff responding at the jaguar exhibit immediately called for help over the radio and were assisted by other staff with a fire extinguisher to keep the cats away from the child. Zoo staff are trained to use fire extinguishers to safely overwhelm potentially dangerous animals if an incident like this were to occur. Zoo staff were able to successfully keep the cats back while other Zoo staff lowered a ladder into the exhibit. A Zoo staffer then climbed into the exhibit and retrieved the child who was conscious and responding. The child was then handed to the child's father and both were taken by golf cart to the Zoo's back gate entrance where the child was placed in an ambulance and taken to a nearby hospital. 
 
 City manager Bruce Moore said, "Our thoughts and prayers are with the child and the family. The safety of our citizens is of paramount value and our staff followed training procedures on rescuing the child and were able to respond quickly and efficiently and work with emergency personnel. A full investigation into the incident is being conducted." 
 
 The Little Rock Zoo was renewed for accreditation

 Bloomingdale’s, the luxury department store owned by Macy’s Inc., M 0.79 % is the latest advertiser to face an outpouring of criticism on the Web. 
 
 Consumers have taken to social media this week to criticize an ad in Bloomingdale’s holiday catalog that some interpreted as encouraging date rape. 
 
 The ad features a woman laughing with her head turned as a young man looks her way. The text reads: “Spike Your Best Friend’s Eggnog When They’re Not Looking.” 
 
 There have been 3,868 comments on social media channels over the last 48 hours about the ad, according to data from social media analytics firm Networked Insights. The majority of the comments, Networked Insights said, are negative. Data shows that many of the online commentators have called the ad “creepy.” 
 
 Bloomingdale’s has apologized for the ad. “In reflection of recent feedback, the copy we used in our current catalog was inappropriate and in poor taste. Bloomingdale’s sincerely apologizes for this error in judgment,” said the company in a statement. 
 
 It’s unclear what the intention of the ad was, but branding experts say that marketers are under pressure to stand out amid the ever-increasing amount of advertising messages that consumers are being bombarded with every day. And even more is at stake heading into the all-important holiday shopping season. 
 
 “Marketers have to work harder to get attention nowadays, but the more they try, the riskier it becomes,” said Jonah Disend, chief executive officer of Redscout, a branding firm owned by MDC Partners. 
 
 Bloomingdale’s is the latest company to see how quickly controversy can spread thanks in part to social media. Earlier this week, consumers took to social media to complain about Starbuck’s new red holiday cups or to vent about the fact there was even a controversy.

 TIPS: Is there a story we should be covering? ||||| Superintendent hopes for re-evaluation of celibacy 
 
 Nancy Kotowski said Wednesday that she hopes the revelation this week that she had a long-term relationship with a priest will open a dialogue within the Catholic Church about its clerical celibacy requirements. 
 
 Kotowski, the Monterey County superintendent of schools, said the "physical aspect" of her long-term relationship with the Rev. Mike Manning ended about three years ago. 
 
 Manning, a prominent figure in the church in Southern California, has taken a leave of absence from his ministry after his relationship with Kotowski, his second cousin, was reported by the San Bernardino Sun and published in The Herald on Wednesday. 
 
 Manning has stepped away from Wordnet, a worldwide Catholic television ministry based in San Bernardino, said John Andrews, a spokesman for the diocese. 
 
 Kotowski said she believes news of her relationship might open discussion about Catholic mandates on celibacy. 
 
 "The reality is that we love the church, we're committed to the church, but I'm hoping a dialogue will open up (about) obligatory celibacy, the whole question of celibacy," she said Wednesday during a telephone interview with The Herald. "Is it right for all people?" 
 
 The Sun story described communications between Kotowski and the priest. The correspondence included their conflicts in determining whether Manning should leave the priesthood to marry Kotowski. 
 
 "We're soul mates, and in any human relationship, especially one of over 30 years, you reach a decision-making

 point, and our relationship reached that point," Kotowski said. 
 
 Kotowski said she takes exception to media descriptions of her relationship with Manning as an "affair" because she believes theirs was a life-long commitment. 
 
 "It's a 30-year relationship of love for one another," she said. "That's what it was." 
 
 Kotowski, 59, and Manning, 70, are cousins on her mother's side, and did not grow up together, she said. Manning left for the seminary when he was 14, and she was 3. 
 
 Kotowski attended Manning's ordination and first Mass, but their paths did not cross again until she was in her late 20s, she said. 
 
 Both families know of their relationship and have even welcomed them at family gatherings, she said. 
 
 "My family knows him and loves Father Mike. My family knows of our closeness and our relationship, and they're very happy we have each other on our life journey. They know we're kindred spirits and soul mates." 
 
 They are now embracing celibacy, Kotowski said, because she supports Manning's calling. 
 
 "It's a struggle, but we know God is calling to us, so we honor that," she said. 
 
 Kotowski would not say how long the physical aspect of her relationship lasted, nor whether she has had other long-term relationships. She has never married and has no children. 
 
 Kotowski said she is not concerned with how the revelations of her relationship with Manning will play out because she feels she has done nothing wrong or illegal.

 President Donald Trump renewed his attack on the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, accusing his own appointee, Chairman Jerome "Jay" Powell, of stunting the nation's economic growth. 
 
 "It almost looks like he's happy raising interest rates," said Trump in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published late Tuesday. 
 
 He also said he "maybe" regretted nominating Powell to the position, noting that "I have a hot economy going," and that "every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates." 
 
 The biggest risk to the economy was not tariffs, said Trump, nor an escalating trade war, nor punitive measures related to tensions with Saudi Arabia over the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but rather the fact that the Fed is raising interest rates too quickly. 
 
 Trump compared his presidency to that of Barack Obama, taking care to point out that Obama operated with "zero interest" rates from the Fed, which held rates artificially low for almost a decade in order to allow the economy to grow after the 2008 recession. 
 
 “How the hell do you compete with that?" Trump noted. 
 
 The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by one-quarter point three times this year, with a fourth increase likely slated for December as monetary policymakers seek to temper credit demand. 
 
 Powell has made note of the Fed's precarious position as the economy heats up, saying in August that the Fed currently faces two main risks — either “moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion" or "moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating." 
 
 Tuesday's attack marks the latest in the president's feud with the Fed. Last week, Trump lambasted the chairman, saying "I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast." 
 
 It used to be rare for a sitting president to comment on the Fed, which is supposed to remain immune to political pressure. Trump said last week that he had no intention of firing Powell, and there is no historical precedent for such action. 
 
 According to Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act it is technically possible, since "each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner removed for cause by the President." ||||| President Trump has put the Federal Reserve at the middle of the latest drop in the markets, saying the "Fed has gone crazy."

 WASHINGTON—President Trump escalated his attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, saying the head of the nation’s central bank threatened U.S. economic growth and appeared to enjoy raising interest rates. 
 
 In an interview Tuesday with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump acknowledged the independence the Fed has long enjoyed in setting... ||||| New York (CNN Business) For the third week in a row, President Donald Trump is criticizing Jerome Powell, the man he picked to lead the Federal Reserve. 
 
 In an interview Tuesday with The Wall Street Journal , Trump said that Powell raises interest rates "every time we do something great." 
 
 The Fed chair "almost looks like he's happy raising interest rates," the president said. He also told the newspaper that it was "too early to tell, but maybe" he regretted nominating Powell to the position. 
 
 The criticism echoes comments Trump made last week in an interview with Fox Business in which he said that the Fed is his "biggest threat." 
 
 Michelle Smith, a spokeswoman for the Fed, declined to comment on Trump's remarks Tuesday. 
 
 Presidents have for decades refrained from commenting on the Fed, a stance adopted to avoid compromising its independence — and its credibility with financial markets. 
 
 In the run-up to the midterms, Trump has pitched voters on his stewardship of the economy. He threw Washington into a frenzy this week by promising to introduce a fresh round of tax cuts before the midterms , expanding on last year's landmark tax reform. 
 
 But the president has lately expressed frustration with the Fed's gradual interest rate increases, designed to slow down the economy and prevent inflation from taking off — standard macroeconomic steps that Trump insists are undercutting his expansionary fiscal moves. 
 
 Earlier this month, as investors dumped stocks amid concerns over rising interest rates, Trump said the central bank was "going loco" and "out of control."

 Trump complained to the Journal on Tuesday that former President Barack Obama — who came into office amid the worst recession in decades — didn't have to deal with the

As you may know, on late Sunday evening, while riding the train in Oakland, a white man targeted two young Black women on the train, without ever saying a word to them, and killed one – a beautiful young soul named Nia Wilson, an 18 year old high school student, and critically injured her sister – stabbing and slashing them both with a knife – then simply walking away. 
 
 I spent all day yesterday doing everything I could to make this story into national news and was prepared this morning to come on and talk about how we needed to work harder to find Nia’s killer, but I am glad to report that at about 6pm West Coast time, John Lee Cowell, a brutal man with a history of violence across his entire life, was arrested and charged with Nia’s murder. 
 
 I wanna comment on a few things about this case that grieve me. 
 
 Nia Wilson, above all, was a teenage girl. She was a high school senior – the exact same age of my oldest daughter. And yesterday, after just a few hours of sharing her story, I saw something truly sick starting to unfold. First, a local news station in the Bay Area shared an image of Nia holding what looked like a gun. Why did they share that image? What were they trying to convey? And, as it turns out, she wasn’t holding a gun in that image, it was a cell phone case with a gun handle. It was a basically a gag – and the local news showed it like it said something about Nia’s character. She literally posted nearly 1,000 wonderful photos of her life on Instagram and Facebook, and they chose that one. 
 
 Even in death, local news media finds a way to demean us. It’s why I believe so much in having our own outlets, our own platforms, our own morning shows, where we define our own stories and narratives without that type of ugliness. 
 
 Secondly, last night in Oakland thousands of people, including members of Nia’s own family, showed up to her outdoor vigil. Now I don’t need to explain this to our listeners, but this was a moment of pain, and grief, and support. And white supremacists from the group Proud Boys, wearing red Make American Great Again hats, literally showed up to interrupt the vigil. 
 
 Let me pause right here for a moment. 
 
 Never – in the entire history of this country – will you find an example of white people coming together to grieve the brutal murder of their loved one – the day after it happened – only to have their grief physically interrupted by belligerent Black folk telling them that they are worthless. It’s never happened. It never will happen. 
 
 How cruel, how evil, how heartless, how crass, how foul do you have to be, how rotten must you be from the inside out, how dry and dead must your soul be – to have the idea that you want to interrupt grieving people and demean them the day after their loved one was murdered? 
 
 I wanna linger here for a moment because I think it gives us a real glimpse into the sick psychology of exactly who we are dealing with and fighting against. They interrupt our grief because they don’t even really see us as fully human. 
 
 Let me close with this final thought. 
 
 This morning I saw the video of the arrest of John Lee Cowell. Police don’t draw their guns. They don’t slam him to the concrete and put their knees into his back while putting on his handcuffs. They don’t Taser him. They don’t choke him. 
 
 You’d think they were arresting a man for writing a bad check or stealing a shirt from a department store. 
 
 And so often after we see a horrible incident of police brutality against Black folk, we talk about how American police need more training and better training. I’ve said that myself, but police show us over and over and over again – with white men who are considered armed and dangerous – who’ve just brutally murdered people – that they are fully willing and able to remain calm, and cool, and collected, and methodical – whenever they feel like it. 
 
 All these years we thought they needed to be trained on how to make a peaceful arrest – and it turns out they’re great at it – even with the most vicious and violent murderers – if they’re white. 
 
 We’re not saying that the police should’ve beaten or choked or shot or maimed or Tasered this man, we’re saying that we want unarmed, non-violent Black folk to get the same treatment American police are so willing able to give dangerous white murderers. ||||| Viewers of local Oakland news station KTVU are expressing outrage after the station used a photo of slain teen Nia Wilson holding what appears to be a gun during a broadcast about her

CHARLOTTE -- The second day of the Democratic convention features one president -- Bill Clinton -- promoting another -- Barack Obama. 
 
 USA TODAY is providing full coverage of the Democratic National Convention online and in print. Check local TV listings for when you can catch the action from the Time Warner Cable Arena. 
 
 Here are five things to watch for Wednesday, Sept. 5: 
 
 1) Bubba is back: Observers will be looking to see how much Bill Clinton talks about Obama, and how much he talks about his own record from the 1990s. Also in the back of every Democrat's mind: Will Hillary Rodham Clinton run for president in 2016? The former president speaks last, probably starting after 10:30 p.m. ET 
 
 2) Elizabeth Warren is ready for her close-up: Warren, a Harvard law professor and long-time consumer advocate, is the Democratic nominee for Senate in Massachusetts. It's one of the nation's hottest Senate races, and could determine which party controls the chamber. She is challenging Republican incumbent Scott Brown, who won the seat after the death of Edward Kennedy. 
 
 3) Locking down the women's vote: Warren is one a series of female speakers at the convention, as Obama seeks to exploit his advantage over Republican challenger Mitt Romney among female voters, using such issues as contraceptives and abortion rights. Among the speakers tonight: Sandra Fluke, who was called a "slut" and "prostitute" by radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh after she testified on behalf of contraception services in health care plans. 
 
 4) The "great state" roll call: Officially, the convention is about nominating Obama and Vice President Biden to a second term and to do that, the roll call is required. Obama had no major party opposition in the primary season, so guess who's the favorite? But it's unclear how much TV viewers will see: The roll call is supposed to begin after Clinton speaks. 
 
 5) The arrival: President Obama arrives in Charlotte this afternoon. Will he make a "surprise" appearance at the convention? Perhaps on stage with Bill Clinton? We don't know. We do know Obama will address the convention on Thursday night. ||||| President Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina and deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter downplayed questions about Bill Clinton's speech not being vetted by the campaign at a Bloomberg News breakfast this morning, calling it a "mountain out of a molehill." 
 
 "We have had lots of conversations with President Clinton," said Messina. "This is a mountain out of a molehill. He's going to give a great speech tomorrow." 
 
 Has he seen the speech? No, Messina acknowledged at the start. Cutter added, "Someone in our organization is likely to see the speech before [Clinton] gives it just because that's the normal course of business." 
 
 She added that everyone believes Clinton will give a strong endorsement of Obama's policies, which Messina said Clinton will describe as similar to his own. . 
 
 "We are not one bit worried about what President Clinton is going to say" in his speech, she added. 
 
 Still, there was no illusion about controlling the former president — asked at the outset who is editing Clinton's speech, Cutter replied, "Bill Clinton." ||||| BOSTON -- Ask any Republican or Democrat to name the most important Senate races in the fight for control of the Democratic-led chamber, and they will undoubtedly include one state in particular: Massachusetts. The state's Republican Sen. Scott Brown will go up against Democrat and Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren in what polling indicates is likely to be a close race. 
 
 Such a contest, so far the most expensive U.S. Senate race, was not unexpected in this traditionally Democratic state. Brown, 52, shocked the political establishment in 2010 with his victory in the special election to fill the late Ted Kennedy's seat. This is the year that Kennedy would have been up for re-election, so Brown is up again a mere two years after his first win. 
 
 Those familiar with Massachusetts politics, including Brown himself, always expected Democrats to mount an attempt to take back the seat this time around. 
 
 WHAT TO KNOW A closer look at what's going on in the most closely watched Senate race in the country 
 
 "They want the Kennedy seat back very badly," Brown told ABC News. "They've made that clear. But bottom line is, it's not the Kennedy seat, it's not the Democrats seat, it's still the people's seat." 
 
 What was unknown was who would jump in to challenge the freshmen senator. That candidate turned out to be Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School and creator of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a newly formed, federal department that came about under the Obama administration.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange may be a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, but the controversial activist isn’t happy with the actor’s new WikiLeaks film, “The Fifth Estate.” 
 
 Cumberbatch, who portrays Assange in the DreamWorks drama, had apparently reached out to Assange before shooting the film, but the WikiLeaks founder later declined and went on to explain in a new letter why he refused to meet with the British actor while again voicing his displeasure with the film. 
 
 “I believe you are a good person, but I do not believe that this film is a good film,” Assange wrote. 
 
 “Your skills play into the hands of people who are out to remove me and WikiLeaks from the world...I believe that you should reconsider your involvement in this enterprise.” 
 
 This isn’t the first time WikiLeaks has criticized the Bill Condon-directed drama, which is partly based on the book “Inside WikiLeaks: My Time With Julian Assange and the World’s Most Dangerous Website,” by Daniel Domscheit-Berg. 
 
 Last month, the controversial site blasted the new film for its inaccuracies and depictions of the WikiLeaks staff. 
 
 “Most of the events depicted never happened, or the people shown were not involved in them. It has real names, real places, and looks like it is covering real events, but it is still a dramatic and cinematic work, and it invents or shapes the facts to fit its narrative goals,” the org wrote.

 Read Assange’s letter to Cumberbatch below: 
 
 Date: Tue, 15 Jan 2013 
 
 From: Julian Assange 
 
 To: Benedict Cumberbatch 
 
 Subject: Message from Assange 
 
 Dear Benedict, 
 
 Thank you for trying to contact me. It is the first approach by anyone from the Dreamworks production to me or WikiLeaks. 
 
 My assistants communicated your request to me, and I have given it a lot of thought and examined your previous work, which I am fond of. 
 
 I think I would enjoy meeting you. 
 
 The bond that develops between an actor and a living subject is significant. 
 
 If the film reaches distribution we will forever be correlated in the public imagination. Our paths will be forever entwined. Each of us will be granted standing to comment on the other for many years to come and others will compare our characters and trajectories. 
 
 But I must speak directly. 
 
 I hope that you will take such directness as a mark of respect, and not as an unkindness. 
 
 I believe you are a good person, but I do not believe that this film is a good film. 
 
 I do not believe it is going to be positive for me or the people I care about. 
 
 I believe that it is going to be overwhelmingly negative for me and the people I care about. 
 
 It is based on a deceitful book by someone who has a vendetta against me and my organisation. 
 
 In other circumstances this vendetta may have gone away, but our conflict with the United States government and the establishment press has created a patronage and commissioning market – powerful, if unpopular – for works and comments that are harmful to us. 
 
 There are dozens of positive books about WikiLeaks, but Dreamworks decided 
 
 to base its script only on the most toxic. So toxic is the first book selected by Dreamworks that it is distributed to US military bases as a mechanism to discourage military personnel from communicating with us. Its author is publicly known to be involved in the Dreamworks production in an ongoing capacity. 
 
 Dreamworks’ second rights purchase is the next most toxic, biased book. Published and written by people we have had a bitter contractual dispute with for years, whose hostility is well known. Neither of these two books were the first to be published and there are many independent authors who have written positive or neutral books, all of whom Dreamworks ignored. 
 
 Dreamworks has based its entire production on the two most discredited books on the market. 
 
 I know the film intends to depict me and my work in a negative light. 
 
 I believe it will distort events and subtract from public understanding. 
 
 It does not seek to simplify, clarify or distil the truth, but rather it seeks to bury it. 
 
 It will resurrect and amplify defamatory stories which were long ago shown 
 
 to be false.

 My organisation and I are the targets of political adversary from the United States government and its closest allies.

VATICAN CITY — Ban Ki-moon arrived at the Vatican with his own college of cardinals. Mr. Ban, the United Nations secretary general, had brought the leaders of all his major agencies to see Pope Francis, a show of organizational muscle and respect for a meeting between two global institutions that had sometimes shared a bumpy past but now had a mutual interest. 
 
 The agenda was poverty, and Francis inveighed against the “economy of exclusion” as he addressed Mr. Ban’s delegation at the Apostolic Palace. But in an informal meeting with Mr. Ban and his advisers, Francis shifted the discussion to the environment and how environmental degradation weighed heaviest on the poor. 
 
 “This is the pope of the poor,” said Robert Orr, who attended the May 2014 meeting as Mr. Ban’s special adviser on climate change and described the informal conversation with Francis. “The fact that he is making the link to the planet is really significant.” 
 
 On Thursday, Francis will release his first major teaching letter, known as an encyclical, on the theme of the environment and the poor. Given the pope’s widespread popularity, and his penchant for speaking out on major global issues, the encyclical is being treated as a milestone that could place the Roman Catholic Church at the forefront of a new coalition of religion and science. ||||| CLOSE Shannon Green and Gregg Zoroya discuss the encyclical from Pope Francis to be issued by the Vatican on Thursday, June 18, and the excitement it engenders among climate scientists. USA TODAY

 Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this article misstated Pope Francis' chemistry education. He studied chemistry and worked as a chemist prior to attending the seminary. 
 
 Scientists weary after years of often vicious opposition by doubters of their climate-change findings see this year as crucial to the planet's future because of a religious document expected from Pope Francis on Thursday. 
 
 The rare encyclical, or teaching letter, expected to promote climate action as a moral imperative could do more to slow global warming than international negotiations this year to limit greenhouse gas emissions, scientists say. 
 
 "The encyclical is going to go out to over 1 billion Catholics — that's a way of getting a message across to a segment of society that the scientific community could never do," said an excited Jeff Kiehl with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. "I mean it's just unbelievable." 
 
 "I'm not a religious person at all," said Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climatologist. But he sees faith-based efforts to shift thinking on climate action as very promising. 
 
 "The pope's encyclical is probably going to have a bigger impact than the Paris negotiations," he said. 
 
 The 21st United Nations conference on climate change, which is set for December in Paris with more than 190 countries, hopes to reach agreement on emissions that would keep further warming of the planet less than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, beyond global temperature at the time of the Industrial Revolution. 
 
 Catholic leaders expressed hope last week that the encyclical will transcend partisan fighting over the causes of climate change, arguments that have stymied efforts in the U.S. Congress and elsewhere to reduce greenhouse emissions. 
 
 "This encyclical is aimed at everyone," Pope Francis said Sunday. "Let us pray that everyone can receive its message and grow in responsibility toward the common home that God has entrusted to us." 
 
 He said Friday that to show unity of purpose, the document will be unveiled by three people: a Catholic cardinal, a Christian Orthodox church leader and a climate scientist the Vatican identified as an atheist. 
 
 The pope, who studied chemistry and worked as a chemist before entering the seminary, has a history of environmental concern. He said in January that science is largely settled on the causes of climate change and that greater stewardship of God's creation is necessary. 
 
 "Mostly, in great part, it is man who has slapped nature in the face," he said. 
 
 There has already been push back from conservative Catholic religious writers and figures such as Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who is Catholic, accusing the pope of being alarmist. 
 
 "The church has gotten it wrong a few times on science, and I think that we probably are better off leaving science to the scientists," Santorum recently told a radio-talk show host. "When we get involved with political and controversial scientific theories, then I think the church is probably not as forceful and credible." 
 
 Scientists, however, applaud the pope for urging moral choices in a discussion dominated by the recitation — or among deniers, the misrepresentation — of facts.

Meet Mark Block, Herman Cain's top adviser and the newest YouTube star of the 2012 presidential campaign. 
 
 Block is the star of the video below, which was posted to Cain's account, and shows the former Wisconsin political operative reflecting on the campaign and puffing on a cigarette. It ends with a shot of Cain giving a sidelong smile to the camera as the song "I Am America" plays. 
 
 “We’ve run a campaign like nobody’s ever seen," Block says in the video. "But then, America’s never seen a candidate like Herman Cain.” 
 
 It took about 10 seconds for someone to scoop up the Twitter account @FakeMarkBlock and add this bio: "Herman Cain COS. Smoker. Post modern genius." ||||| “We’ve run a campaign like nobody’s ever seen,” says Mark Block, Herman Cain chief of staff and protagonist of his latest ad, which dropped today online. He may be right, because it has been quite a while, if ever, since we’ve seen an ad like this. A close up of Block speaking takes up most of the time, giving the impression that this is a normal campaign spot, until he concludes that “together we can do this. Together we can take this country back.” Then things get weird. 
 
 The end of the sentence prompts the beginning of a dramatic song with a woman proclaiming “I AM AMERICA” (it’s a song we’ve heard before, by Krista Branch), and, for some reason, serves a cue for Block to reveal in slow motion that he is smoking a cigarette. He takes a breath and blows nicotine into the camera while Branch sings the chorus of her song. A profile of Herman Cain then fades into view, concluding one of the most bizarre 5-10 second chunks of film in some time.

 Of course, everything Block previously had to say fades almost immediately from memory as he reveals this new riddle. Why is he smoking– a more or less unpopular practice, particularly for millennials– in this ad? The only answer the audience gets is that he is smoking because “I am America, once voice, united we stand,” or something. Is this ad secretly not pro-Herman Cain, but actually anti-Mike Bloomberg? Who knows, but it will definitely be a water cooler topic for the next few days. 
 
 Watch the new Herman Cain ad below: 
 
 
 
 Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| no he cain't Five Theories About the Bizarre New Herman Cain Campaign Ad [Updated] 
 
 We've gotten used to being baffled by Herman Cain on an almost daily basis, but a new ad his campaign released last night really takes things to a new level. Coinciding with a new New York Times/CBS News poll that shows Cain still leading the GOP field  ⁇  25 percent to 21 percent over Mitt Romney  ⁇  the 56-second ad is simply one of the strangest you'll ever see. It consists mostly of Cain's unknown, mustachioed chief of staff, Mark Block, staring straight into the camera and saying patriotic, optimistic things about the Cain candidacy. The real weirdness, though, takes place in the ad's final fifteen seconds. First, Block takes a long, slow drag of a cigarette as a painfully cheesy tea party anthem begins to play. Then we see a close-up of Cain turning to the camera and very slowly breaking into a smile. In the words of one YouTube commenter who we're not going to try to top, "I imagine Herman Cain is closing the curtains behind him at that shady motel, turning slowly, and making that creepy smile at a scared prostitute on the bed." 
 
 
 
 The whole ad is odd, but it's the cigarette that has most people talking. So let's think about why it might have been included. Here are five theories, in order of least plausible to most plausible. 
 
 
 
 5. Over at Salon, Steve Kornacki suggests that the "smoking shot ... could represent Cain’s defiant response to recent media scrutiny of his three-year run in the late 1990s as the head of the National Restaurant Association, during which time he aligned the lobbying group with the tobacco industry." Maybe! But that's a pretty obscure reference, and Cain doesn't tend to obsess about the media as much as some other GOP politicians. 
 
 4. The smoking scene was another way to signal that Cain is not your normal, focus-grouped, politically correct politician. His chief of staff will smoke a cigarette like he's a rogue cop in a film noir, and he doesn't care if the anti-tobacco groups or

Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, spoke out for the first time Monday since a videotape was released of her husband making lewd comments about women in 2005, saying, "we are moving on." 
 
 Trump made the comments to Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt in an interview Tuesday morning on "Fox & Friends." 
 
 “Those words, they were offensive to me and they were inappropriate,” Trump told Fox News. “And he apologized to me. And I expect -- I accept his apology. And we are moving on.” 
 
 Trump added that she believes the mainstream media wants to damage her and her family by “saying lies about me, lies about my family.” 
 
 She said in the interview that the comments that were made on the tape were not made by the person she knows and that any other allegation of Donald Trump’s sexual misconduct should be handled in court. 
 
 Trump was then asked what she would tell women who were deterred because of the lewd tapes. 
 
 “My husband is kind and he’s a gentleman. He cares about people. He cares about women.” 
 
 She also said that it's fair for the media and her husband to bring up former President Bill Clinton's infidelities amid his wife's presidential campaign. 
 
 “They're asking for it. They started,” Trump said, referring to nude images from the 1990s published by the New York Post earlier this year. “They started from the beginning of the campaign putting my picture from modeling days." 
 
 "That was my modeling days and I'm proud what I did. I worked very hard,” she added. 
 
 Melania Trump's image later was used in a negative ad campaign during the Republican primary. 
 
 At the time of its release, Donald Trump accused former rival Ted Cruz of being involved and responded by tweeting an unflattering image of the Texas senator's wife. Cruz denied involvement in the release of the photos. 
 
 As for any debate advice for her husband, Trump said that he should “be himself and talk about the issues.” ||||| (CNN) Melania Trump defended Donald Trump in her first interview since the Republican nominee faced allegations of sexual misconduct, calling those accusations "lies" and saying Trump was "egged on" into "boy talk" during a 2005 tape in which he made lewd comments about women. 
 
 "I believe my husband. I believe my husband," she said in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday. 
 
 "This was all organized from the opposition. And with the details ... did they ever check the background of these women? They don't have any facts." 
 
 She also said she hadn't heard her husband use that kind of language before. 
 
 "No. No, that's why I was surprised, because I said like I don't know that person that would talk that way, and that he would say that kind of stuff in private," Melania Trump said. 
 
 "I heard many different stuff -- boys talk," she said. "The boys, the way they talk when they grow up and they want to sometimes show each other, 'Oh, this and that' and talking about the girls. But yes, I was surprised, of course."

 She specifically attacked a first-person account in People Magazine, in which journalist Natasha Stoynoff said Trump made an unwanted advance while she worked on a story about his one-year wedding anniversary. 
 
 The reporter described a chance encounter later with Melania Trump, who says it never happened -- and her lawyers have threatened to sue over the claim. 
 
 "Even the story that came out in people magazine, the writer she said my husband took her to the room and start kissing her," she said. "She wrote in the same story about me -- that she saw me on 5th Avenue, and I said to her, 'Natasha, how come we don't see you anymore?' I was never friends with her, I would not recognize her." 
 
 That, Melania Trump said, "was another thing like people come out saying lies and not true stuff." 
 
 'Egged on' 
 
 It was the first public defense Melania Trump has made of her husband since a tape in which Trump bragged about sexually aggressive behavior toward women was published by The Washington Post and NBC. In the wake of that report, several women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. 
 
 Trump said her husband was "egged on" in the 2005 tape in which he made lewd comments about his own sexually aggressive behavior toward women -- remarks she says were "

Davis discloses terminating pregnancy in her memoir 
 
 AUSTIN - Sen. Wendy Davis, in her memoir due out next week, discloses the most personal of stories preceding her nationally marked fight against tighter abortion restrictions: a decision she and her then-husband made 17 years ago to end a much-wanted pregnancy. 
 
 The book, “Forgetting to Be Afraid,” goes on sale to the general public Tuesday. Copies will be available Monday at a Fort Worth book signing by Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott. 
 
 Davis, in a copy of the book obtained by the San Antonio Express-News, wrote that her unborn third daughter had an acute brain abnormality. She said doctors told her the syndrome would cause the baby to suffer and likely was incompatible with life. 
 
 After getting several medical opinions and feeling the baby they had named Tate Elise “tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her” in the womb, she said the decision was clear. 
 
 “She was suffering,” Davis wrote. 
 
 The unborn baby's heart was “quieted” by her doctor, and their baby was gone. She was delivered by cesarean section in spring 1997, the memoir says. 
 
 Davis wrote that she and her then-husband, Jeff, spent time with Tate the next day and had her baptized. They cried, took photographs and said their good-byes, she wrote, and Tate's lifeless body was taken away the following day. 
 
 “An indescribable blackness followed. It was a deep, dark despair and grief, a heavy wave that crushed me, that made me wonder if I would ever surface. ... And when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person. Changed. Forever changed,” Davis wrote. 
 
 The 304-page hardcover is priced at $27.97 from Blue Rider Press, and imprint of the Penguin Group. 
 
 The book's title comes from a Lady Bird Johnson quote: “Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid.” 
 
 Abortion rights have been a major undercurrent in the race for governor between the Fort Worth Democrat and Abbott, a staunch abortion opponent. He has indicated he opposes the procedure even for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, saying, “We shouldn't discriminate against a child.” 
 
 The Abbott campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
 
 Her memoir is being published as she trails in the polls behind Abbott, who is favored at a time when Democrats haven't elected anyone to statewide office in two decades. 
 
 Rice University political scientist Mark Jones said he doesn't expect the revelation to lose any votes for Davis, since he said it's a relative small proportion of voters who oppose abortion in cases of severe fetal abnormality. 
 
 “The group that will be most bothered by her having an abortion of a baby with a severe fetal abnormality is a group that wasn't going to vote for her anyway,” he said. 
 
 “The positive side of it for her is it humanizes her, and also makes it a little tricky for opponents to attack her on the abortion issue because now, it not only is a political issue for her, but it's a personal issue,” Jones said. 
 
 Davis launched her campaign last year after rising to national prominence with her fight against tighter abortion restrictions through a filibuster in which she shared women's personal stories. 
 
 Her pregnancy with Tate hasn't come up in the race, although she wrote that she considered talking about it during the filibuster when she read the story of a woman that was wrenchingly close to her own. 
 
 That woman said the legislation's ban on abortion at 20 weeks would have prevented her choice on how best to proceed when her unborn baby was diagnosed with a terminal condition. Davis said she almost shared her story of Tate then, but she felt it would overshadow the day's events. 
 
 Davis has previously disclosed the termination of another pregnancy, a medical necessity because the egg was implanted in her fallopian tube. That ectopic pregnancy wasn't sustainable, and her doctor advised her it would be dangerous to her health to continue because it would risk rupturing her tube, she said in her memoir. 
 
 Davis wrote that the ending of the ectopic pregnancy “is technically considered an abortion,” and that that she also was “heartbroken” over that loss. She said she believed that she was carrying a boy, whom she and Jeff already referred to as “Baby Lucas.” 
 
 In her campaign, Davis has largely couched the abortion issue in terms of women's access to health care. 
 
 The story of her pregnancy with Tate, however, is a key part of her memoir. The book's dedication begins,

HUNTINGTON BEACH – When Diana Carrillo, her sister and two friends decided to try the Saint Marc Pub-Cafe in Pacific City last week, they were hoping for a nice shared experience. 
 
 They got a shared experience, but not one they would have expected. 
 
 When they were seated, 24-year-old Carrillo of Irvine, said the waiter asked her, “Can I see your proof of residency?” 
 
 Carrillo said she was shocked. 
 
 “I already had my ID out. I couldn’t say anything,” she said. 
 
 She turned to her sister, Brenda Carrillo, and friends and said, “Did he just ask me that?” 
 
 Carrillo said the waiter asked the other three women the same thing, saying “I need to make sure you’re residents before I serve you.” 
 
 After talking with the manager, who apologized, the four left the restaurant. Carrillo related her experience, on Saturday, March 11, on social media, which has since taken on a life of its own. 
 
 The restaurant posted an apology three days later that said in part, “This type of behavior is not representative of the St. Marc brand and will not be tolerated.” 
 
 Kent Berden, the senior director of operations at the restaurant, said Wednesday that he fired the waiter, whose name was not disclosed. He said the waiter’s actions were unacceptable and not reflective of the restaurant. 
 
 “The individual didn’t follow corporate policy by any stretch of the imagination,” Berden said. 
 
 He said this was the first such complaint the restaurant has had since it opened in 2015. 
 
 Carrillo, whose parents are immigrants, said the interaction was part of what she fears is going to be a growing trend. 
 
 “I feel that’s the direction we’re headed in, given who’s the president,” she said. “That’s one of the reasons I posted it on social media rather than just dealing with the restaurant.” 
 
 Berden said the waiter told him he thought the question was asked “in a joking fashion.” 
 
 Carrillo isn’t buying it. She said the waiter showed no hint of humor, just a “bad vibe.” 
 
 The restaurant contacted Carrillo and offered to donate 10 percent of this weekend’s sales to a charity of her choice and invited the four women to be VIP guests. 
 
 Carrillo said she declined the invitation but did accept the restaurant’s donation offer, asking that it go to Orange County Immigrant Youth United. The restaurant said it would comply.

 Teen who killed FHP trooper's K-9 gets 23-year sentence by judge ||||| Ivins Rosier, 17, is charged with one count of burglary of a dwelling with... (Palm Beach County Sheriff's...) 
 
 Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Robert Boody's retired police dog, Drake, was near death when Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Detective Philip DiMola questioned one of the suspects in the canine's shooting, then-16-year-old Ivins Rosier. 
 
 "If you shoot that dog and he dies, that's murder of a law enforcement officer," DiMola pressed Rosier on Nov. 21, 2012, in an interrogation recorded on video and watched by a Palm Beach County jury during its deliberations Friday. 
 
 As it turned out, the juvenile then confessed to DiMola, the 5-year-old German shepherd was euthanized two days later, and Rosier was charged as an adult and this week put on trial — but not for murdering a cop since Drake was retired and the law treats killing a dog differently than a human. 
 
 The end result: A guilty verdict on the felony counts of cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm and shooting into a building. 
 
 Circuit Judge Robin Rosenberg ordered Rosier, 17, to be held without bail at the Palm Beach County Jail, while defense attorneys Jack Fleischman and Rachel Preefer said they will seek a new trial and other legal challenges. 
 
 They plan to revisit their pre-trial argument that Rosier's indictment violates his right to be sentenced as a juvenile, which would mean far less prison time for the offenses. 
 
 Also, Fleischman says he'll return to the assertions he made during his closing arguments Thursday: There's insufficient evidence to find his client guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, regardless of the defendant's confession and GPS ankle monitor records showing Rosier was inside Boody's home on the night of the crimes. |||||

In his first public account of the shooting, Timothy Loehmann told grand jurors he thought he was facing an ‘active shooter situation’ 
 
 The officer who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Ohio has delivered his first public account of the killing, over a year after the incident occurred, arguing his actions were justified as he was engaged in an “active shooter situation” and believed Tamir was 18 years old. 
 
 
 
 Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann told grand jurors he shot because Tamir pulled a gun – which turned out to be a pellet gun – from his waistband. “The suspect had a gun, had been threatening others with the weapon and had not obeyed our command to show us his hands,” he said. 
 
 Tamir Rice family lawyers call reports into fatal shooting 'preposterous' Read more 
 
 Loehmann fatally shot Tamir, who was black, within two seconds of arriving at a local park on 22 November last year, after a 911 caller reported that there was a juvenile in the area with a weapon that was “probably fake”. The full details of the call were not passed on to the officers, according to other accounts released by the Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty. 
 
 A Cuyahoga County grand jury is currently considering whether to bring charges against Loehmann, 27, and his partner, 47-year-old Frank Garmback, both of whom are white. Garmback was the driver of the patrol car on the day of the shooting. 
 
 The officers, who had previously declined to be interviewed by county investigators, provided written testimony that was released by prosecutors after being read to grand jurors on Tuesday. 
 
 Loehmann said he told Tamir to raise his hands repeatedly as the boy was “reaching into his waistband” before the officer opened fire and had exited his patrol cruiser because he had been trained that “the cruiser is a coffin”. 
 
 “I observed the suspect pulling the gun out of waistband and his elbow coming up,” Loehmann wrote in his submission, dated 30 November 2015. 
 
 He continued: “With his hands pulling the gun out and his elbow coming up, I knew it was a gun and it was coming out ... the threat to my partner and myself was real and active.” 
 
 Lawyers for the Rice family have repeatedly dismissed claims that Loehmann and Garmback could have given the 12-year-old sufficient warnings or commands, given the fraction of time that passed between the officers arriving on the scene and opening fire. 
 
 On Tuesday, Rice family lawyers described the prosecutor’s decision to allow the officer’s unsworn statements before the grand jury as “a stunning irregularity”. 
 
 
 
 “No regular target of a criminal investigation would be afforded this opportunity,” the group said in a statement. 
 
 In Garmback’s statement, he concedes that the patrol car had slid along the ground and “did not stop where and when I intended”. 
 
 The steady release of evidence presented to the grand jury, including three expert testimonies that concluded the shooting was justified, has been staunchly criticised by Tamir’s parents and protesters in Cleveland, who argue that the drip feed of information is designed to prepare the public for a non-indictment. 
 
 Rice family lawyers have requested the grand jury also hear testimony from two experts who concluded the shooting was not justified. 
 
 Asked for a statement on the officers’ behalf, their attorney, Henry Hiler, said in an email on Tuesday: “We respect the grand jury process and have faith in our judicial system.” 
 
 The officers’ statements were read to the jurors a day after Tamir’s mother, Samaria, testified to the panel about the loss of her son. In a statement, her attorney said she had asked the jurors whether the officers’ actions “could possibly be ‘reasonable’ or ‘justifiable’”. 
 
 “She believes that the answer is plainly no,” the statement said, “and hopes and prays that the grand jury agrees that there is probable cause to indict the officers and hold them accountable for her son’s death.” ||||| A white Cleveland patrolman who shot a 12-year-old black boy carrying a pellet gun told investigators that he and his partner continuously yelled "show me your hands" before he fired the fatal shots, according to the officer's statement released by prosecutors Tuesday. 
 
 The rookie officer said that Tamir Rice didn't obey his commands and that he saw the boy pulling a weapon out of his waist band. 
 
 "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out," officer Timothy Loehmann said in the statement given to investigators. 
 
 It turned out Tamir was carrying a nonlethal, Airsoft-type gun that shoots plastic

DENVER (AP) — A man who lives near Oprah Winfrey's new property above Telluride, Colorado, is suing her for allegedly blocking access to hiking trails open to neighbors for decades. 
 
 Retired physicist Charles D. Goodman claims Winfrey's Yellow Brick Road company, the property's former owners and the town of Mountain Village made a secret deal to close access to the trails that cut across the land purchased for $10.9 million in March. 
 
 The Denver Post (http://bit.ly/1v9yiQQ ) reported Thursday that the former owners, Hoyt and Carol Barnett, asked for a correction to property records shortly before selling the land. 
 
 Goodman claims that erased easements allowing residents of nearby homes to use the trails. 
 
 Mountain Village denies the accusation. Town community development director Chirs Hawkins said the correction only cleared up ambiguities and that the town and Winfrey's team want to continue to allow trail access. 
 
 In a written statement, Yellow Brick Road spokeswoman Wendy Luckenbill said the company will continue to work with the neighbors ensure "reasonable" access for neighbors over portions of the land. 
 
 The trails were established in 1989 after negotiations between Goodman and the U.S. Forest Service, which owned the land at the time. 
 
 Winfrey plans to build a mansion and guest home on the property starting this summer. Plans for the homes haven't been submitted yet but the project will require building a bridge over a ski run and cutting down an estimated 800 to 1,000 trees to comply with the town's wildfire mitigation policies.

The U.S.'s top general in Afghanistan is under investigation for alleged inappropriate communications. The WSJ's Enda Curran tells us what this latest development could mean in a scandal that has impacted officials from the CIA, FBI and now U.S. military. 
 
 WASHINGTON—The adultery scandal that led to the downfall of David Petraeus as CIA director widened Tuesday as President Barack Obama put on hold his nomination of Marine Gen. John Allen as commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, one of the world's top military posts. 
 
 The Pentagon said a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Mr. Petraeus's communications had revealed that Gen. Allen, now the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, exchanged numerous emails with Jill Kelley, the Florida woman who triggered the investigation. Ms. Kelley had complained to the FBI about receiving harassing emails that the agency later traced to a woman involved with Mr. Petraeus. 
 
 On Tuesday, people familiar with the case said that at one point in the summer, after the investigation began pointing to larger potential national security issues, Ms. Kelley tried to get the FBI to drop the matter. The people said she made the request because she was worried about the personal information being provided to investigators.

 After the discovery of allegedly inappropriate e-mails between Marine Gen. John Allen and a Tampa woman, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta asked the Senate to put on hold the confirmation of the top commander in Afghanistan. Photo: Getty Images. 
 
 U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Gen. John Allen's nomination as commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is on hold pending an investigation linked to David Petraeus. The WSJ's Enda Curran has the details. 
 
 Ms. Kelley, a 37-year-old volunteer who organized social events for military personnel, developed misgivings after friends in her Tampa social circle urged her to drop the matter, saying the probe would only cause bigger problems, the people familiar with the case said. 
 
 Ms. Kelley's apparent regret points to one of the more unusual aspects of the case: what began as a seemingly minor case of cyberstalking mushroomed into fears that the Central Intelligence Agency director's personal email account had been hacked, which spawned concerns the CIA director might have passed sensitive information to his mistress. Each of those fears ultimately proved unfounded, U.S. officials familiar with the probe said. But the investigation eventually exposed Mr. Petraeus's relationship with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, leading to his resignation, according to U.S. officials familiar with the probe. 
 
 Into the early fall, investigators focused principally on Ms. Broadwell. They found classified documents on her computer, though they decided there was no proof she had received them from Mr. Petraeus. They also determined that the two had at times shared access to an email account to communicate. 
 
 In the course of determining that the email messages Ms. Kelley complained about had been sent by Ms. Broadwell, investigators also discovered reams of emails between Ms. Kelley and Gen. Allen, both of whom are married. 
 
 Military officials said the FBI had turned over emails between the two, dating back to 2010. Pentagon investigators haven't found any sensitive or classified material in the messages, though they are still reviewing the material. Another government official said no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or security lapses by Gen. Allen had been found. 
 
 Gen. Allen has denied that he had an affair with Ms. Kelley, or that he shared any classified information with her, according to an official familiar with his thinking. He also told officials that he never had been in a room alone with Ms. Kelley and that there had been no affair or sex, the official said. 
 
 White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Mr. Obama remains supportive of Gen. Allen. A defense official urged against prejudging, saying Gen. Allen's nomination as NATO commander may yet go forward. "We probably ought to give him the benefit of the doubt," said a senior defense official. 
 
 Ms. Kelley and Ms. Broadwell haven't commented on the scandal. Defense officials said that Gen. Allen was weighing whether to make a statement. 
 
 The official familiar with Gen. Allen's thinking described Ms. Kelley as a wealthy socialite who was friendly with many top military commanders in Tampa, home of the U.

WASHINGTON—Administration lawyers have presented the White House with four options for restructuring the National Security Agency's phone-surveillance program, from ditching the controversial collection altogether to running it through the telephone companies, according to officials familiar with the discussions.

While Obama had set a date towards the end of March to be presented with these options, according to The Wall Street Journal, the Office of Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department have completed the assignment well ahead of schedule. 
 
 Here are the four options Obama has apparently been presented with:

 This would provide another separation of power, instead of concentrating both the investigators and the data being investigated inside one organization. Candidates could include the FBI and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court A non-telecommunications and non-government agency retains the data. This one is unlikely.

 This one is unlikely. Obama on the matter last month: “Any third party maintaining a single, consolidated data-base would be carrying out what is essentially a government function with more expense, more legal ambiguity, and a doubtful impact on public confidence that their privacy is being protected.” Scrap the program. A daring proposal, but come on, this one's a pipe dream. 
 
 Obama’s own remarks last month lean heavily towards one of the first two options, but it is unclear exactly when a decision will be reached. |||||

We've been told all our lives that we can only call ourselves well-read once we've read the Great Books. We tried. We got halfway through Infinite Jest and halfway through the SparkNotes on Finnegans Wake. But a few pages into Bleak House, we realized that not all the Great Books have aged well. Some are racist and some are sexist, but most are just really, really boring. So we—and a group of un-boring writers—give you permission to strike these books from the canon. Here's what you should read instead. 1. Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry Instead: The Mountain Lion by Jean Stafford I actually love Lonesome Dove, but I'm convinced that the cowboy mythos, with its rigid masculine emotional landscape, glorification of guns and destruction, and misogynistic gender roles, is a major factor in the degradation of America. Rather than perpetuate this myth, I'd love for everyone, but particularly American men, to read The Mountain Lion by Jean Stafford. It's a wicked, brilliant, dark book set largely on a ranch in Colorado, but it acts in many ways as a strong rebuttal to all the old toxic western stereotypes we all need to explode. —Lauren Groff, 'Florida' 
 
 2. The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger Instead: Olivia: A Novel by Dorothy Strachey I have never been able to fathom why The Catcher in the Rye is such a canonical novel. I read it because everyone else in school was reading it but thought it was totally silly. Now, looking back, I find that it is without any literary merit whatsoever. Why waste adolescents' time? Alternatively, I'd suggest Olivia, the story of a British teenage girl who is sent to a boarding school in France. It is short and written in a kind of levelheaded and deceptively straightforward style. Olivia eventually falls in love with her teacher Mademoiselle Julie T, who in turn, and without reciprocating that love out loud, is equally in love with Olivia. Julie never takes a wrong step, but there are signs for those who know how to read them. I read Olivia many, many times, bought it for many of my friends, and consider it the inspiration for Call Me by Your Name. —André Aciman, 'Call Me by Your Name' 
 
 3. Goodbye to All That by Robert Graves Instead: Dispatches by Michael Herr Goodbye to All That, the autobiographical account of Graves's time in the trenches during World War I, is entertaining and enlightening. It's also incredibly racist. Graves includes samples of near unintelligible essays produced by three of his students (“Mahmoud Mohammed Mahmoud,” “Mohammed Mahmoud Mohammed,” and “Mahmoud Mahmoud Mohammed”) from his postwar stint as an English instructor in Cairo. The joke is twofold—all these silly natives have similar-sounding names, and they lack the basic intellectual capacity to grapple with the literature. A better option is Dispatches by Michael Herr. It concerns a different time, country, and war, but this is still, in my mind, the most indispensable personal account of the cruelty and violence of modern warfare. —Omar El Akkad, 'American War' 
 
 4. The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway Instead: The Summer Book by Tove Jansson My father loved The Old Man and the Sea, so I tried to love it. It left me unmoved. Mostly, I kept hoping the fish would get away without too much damage. (When my grandpa pushed me to catch a trout at a fish farm, I threw the rod into the pond.) I'd rather read Tove Jansson's The Summer Book. This series of vignettes about a grandmother and granddaughter living on a remote Finnish island is not just heartwarming: In its views of both Nature and human nature, it teaches us what it is to be in sync with the world. All of Jansson's adult fiction is deeply humane and beautiful. —Jeff VanderMeer, 'Annihilation' 
 
 5. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho Instead: Near to the Wild Heart by Clarice Lispector Somehow, even at 208 pages, The Alchemist is 207 pages too long. A dude wanders the desert, trying to uncover his Personal Legend (capitalized as such throughout the book) while meeting people who speak in the inane aphorisms of a throw pillow: “Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure.” If you're after a book of existential meandering by a Brazilian author, pick up the similarly slim Near to the Wild Heart by Clarice Lispector. Unlike the entitled desert wandering of The Alchemist, Wild Heart's contemplations are inward and complex. For Lispector, there aren't easy answers—and her universe sure as hell is not interested in your hopes and dreams. —Kevin Nguyen, GQ senior editor

 The wife and other family members of the Louisiana theater gunman asked for a temporary protective order in 2008 against the man. 
 
 Court documents seeking the order said John Houser, "exhibited extreme erratic behavior and has made ominous as well as disturbing statements." 
 
 The documents said even though he lived in Phenix City, Alabama, he had come to Carroll County, Georgia, where they lived and "perpetrated various acts of family violence." 
 
 Houser "has a history of mental health issues, i.e., manic depression and/or bi-polar disorder" the filing said. 
 
 The filing says Houser's wife, Kellie Maddox Houser, "has become so worried about the defendant's volatile mental state that she has removed all guns and/or weapons from their marital residence." 
 
 The protection order was at least temporarily granted. 
 
 She filed for divorce in March.

 Randall Mann said his daughter Emily and her friend escaped uninjured. 
 
 "She's traumatized," he said. 
 
 The gunman killed two woman and wounded nine other people before he killed himself Thursday night.

 Police and court records show the Louisiana movie theater gunman has been arrested and ticketed for several offenses in the past, ranging from arson to speeding. 
 
 Police officials said at a news conference Friday that 59-year-old John Russel Houser's arrests date 10 to 15 years ago or more. Those include charges of arson and selling alcohol to a minor. He had been married once in the past but was not currently married. 
 
 In Alabama, records show Houser had four speeding tickets and one no-seatbelt ticket between 1981 and 2003. 
 
 Alabama court records show Houser filed a small claims court lawsuit in 2004 claiming he was injured when he donated plasma at a Phenix City donation center. He asked for $1,800 to pay his emergency room bill and for a narcotics prescription. The case was settled, according to court records.

 A 19-year-old college student who was watching a movie in a theater across the hall from the shooting says he heard three loud pops before the lights came on. 
 
 Jacob Broussard said Friday that he didn't initially know there was a shooting, but as he was evacuating the theater, he saw a woman who had been shot in the leg. 
 
 Authorities say a gunman stood up about 20 minutes into the movie and started firing, killing two women and wounding nine others.

Virginia's outgoing governor has pulled a prank on his successor. 
 
 The Washington Post reported Sunday that Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam found images of Terry McAuliffe on his bed pillows at the Governor's Mansion. 
 
 McAuliffe, also a Democrat, emblazoned the pillows with one of his favorite sayings: "Sleep when you're dead." 
 
 Northam and his wife, first lady Pam Northam, spent their first night in the mansion resting their heads on the 72nd's governor's grinning mug. 
 
 The Post reports that the newly inaugurated Governor was also treated to several photos of McAuliffe around the residence and an early morning wake up call. 
 
 "There are pictures of the governor all over the mansion that he left for me," Northam told the Post. "Also, at 3 o'clock this morning, an alarm clock went off, which I have yet to find. I texted him and thanked him, and he said there was more to come. 
 
 Such pranks are common in Virginia, the only state where the governorship changes hands every four years. 
 
 During the last changeover, Republican Bob McDonnell had left a huge stuffed bear in the private bathroom for a newly sworn-in McAuliffe. It was a real bear taken from the office of McDonnell's natural resources secretary Doug Domenech. 
 
 At a chilly ceremony in Richmond surrounded by his family and, further back, a number of former governors, Northam took the oath to become the Old Dominion's 73rd chief executive on Saturday. 
 
 Northam, a Democrat, veteran and pediatrician who was previously the state's lieutenant governor, beat Republican Ed Gillespie for the seat in November. ||||| Newly inaugurated Gov. Ralph Northam and his wife found pillowcases emblazoned with former governor Terry McAuliffe’s face and a favorite saying on their bed in the governor’s mansion. (Photo by Gov. Ralph Northam/Photo by Gov. Ralph Northam) 
 
 The peaceful transfer of power in Virginia would not be complete without a prank pulled by the outgoing governor on his successor. 
 
 So it was that as newly inaugurated Gov. Ralph Northam (D) hit the sack Saturday night after his inauguration, he found something special on his pillowcase — and it was not one of those fancy hotel good-night chocolates. 
 
 An image of former governor Terry McAuliffe (D) was plastered on his pillowcase, emblazoned with one of the go-go-go ex-governor's favorite sayings: "Sleep when you're dead." 
 
 And yes, Virginia's 73rd governor spent his first night in the mansion with his head resting on the 72nd's governor's grinning mug. His wife, first lady Pam Northam, let him use her McAuliffe-covered pillow, too, opting for a plain pillowcase for herself. 
 
 "Let me show you the picture," Northam said, pulling out his cellphone after a brunch hosted by the first lady Sunday at Richmond's Jefferson Hotel. 
 
 The pillowcases are not the only reminders McAuliffe left behind.

 "There are pictures of the governor all over the mansion that he left for me," Northam said. "Also, at 3 o'clock this morning, an alarm clock went off, which I have yet to find. I texted him and thanked him, and he said there was more to come." 
 
 The alarm clock trick is not a new one, but certain pranks are bound to get recycled in the only state where the governorship changes hands every four years. Departing governor Robert F. McDonnell (R) set one to go off at 4 a.m. four years ago, giving McAuliffe a jolt on his first weekend in the Executive Mansion. 
 
 Another surprise awaited the newly sworn-in McAuliffe when he got to his office: a huge stuffed bear in the private bathroom. It was no teddy bear. It was the real, taxidermied thing, poached from the office of McDonnell's natural resources secretary Doug Domenech. 
 
 On his way out of the governorship, in 2010, now-Sen. Tim Kaine (D) hid cellphones in the mansion elevator shaft and periodically called them as a trick on McDonnell. It took a few days for McDonnell's team to locate them. 
 
 And before that, now-Sen. Mark R. Warner (D) left a life-size cutout of himself in the governor's mansion shower for Kaine. |||||

A woman is escorted by officers near the Bronx Lebanon Hospital in New York after a gunman opened fire there on Friday, June 30, 2017. The gunman, identified as Dr. Henry Bello who used to work at the... (Associated Press) 
 
 NEW YORK (AP) — A doctor who appears to have been the target of a former physician who started shooting at a hospital, killing one person and injuring six, said he has no idea why he would have been singled out. 
 
 Dr. Kamran Ahmed told the New York Post he wasn't the only one Dr. Henry Bello had a problem with. 
 
 However, "he never argued with me," Ahmed said. "I don't know why he put my name." 
 
 A law enforcement official told The Associated Press that Bello arrived at Bronx Lebanon Hospital in the Bronx on Friday with an assault rifle, which was bought in upstate New York about a week earlier, hidden under his lab coat and asked for a doctor he blamed for his having to resign, but the doctor wasn't there at the time. The law enforcement official wasn't authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 
 Ahmed, who specializes in the early detection and treatment of dementia, said Bello "had a problem with almost everybody, so I'm not the only one. That's why they fired him, because so many people complained." 
 
 Authorities said Bello went to the 16th and 17th floors and started shooting anyway, killing Dr. Tracy Sin-Yee Tam, who, like him, was a family medicine doctor. Hospital officials said that Tam normally worked in one of the hospital's satellite clinics and was covering a shift in the main hospital as a favor to someone else. 
 
 "It makes you think that anything can happen to anybody," said Tam's neighbor Alena Khaim, who saw Tam's sister outside the home Friday night overcome with grief, shaking and unable to walk. "She was such a sweet girl. You would never think something like that would happen, but it happened." 
 
 Before the shooting, Bello sent an email to the Daily News, blaming colleagues he said forced him to resign two years earlier. 
 
 "This hospital terminated my road to a licensure to practice medicine," the email said. "First, I was told it was because I always kept to myself. Then it was because of an altercation with a nurse." 
 
 Bello's former co-workers described a man who was aggressive, loud and threatening. Bello had warned his former colleagues when he was forced out in 2015 that he would return someday to kill them. 
 
 "All the time he was a problem," said Dr. David Lazala, who trained Bello. 
 
 When Bello was forced out in 2015, he sent Lazala an email blaming him for the dismissal. 
 
 Bello died from a self-inflicted gunshot. The six injured people were hospitalized. 
 
 Detectives searched the Bronx home where Bello was most recently living and found the box where the gun came from. They later determined it was bought at a gun shop in Schenectady on June 20.

 This story has been corrected to show Bello had an assault rifle, not an automatic weapon. ||||| The doctor who dodged death at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital in the Bronx — at the hands of an assault weapon-toting, crazed former colleague — was shocked to be singled out by the killer. 
 
 “I was surprised,” Kamran Ahmed told The Post. “Why me?” 
 
 Ahmed, 48, said he had worked with shooter Henry Bello, 45, but that he wasn’t the only one Bello had a problem with. 
 
 “He started working there a couple of months after I was hired,” Ahmed said at his Bath Beach apartment Saturday night. 
 
 “He is not only after me, he is after a lot of people. He had a problem with almost everybody, so I’m not the only one. That’s why they fired him, because so many people complained. 
 
 “The strange thing was that he was nice with me,” added Ahmed, who specializes in the early detection and treatment of dementia. 
 
 “He never argued with me. I don’t know why he put my name.” 
 
 Bello was forced to resign from Bronx-Lebanon Hospital in 2015 amid a sexual harassment scandal. 
 
 He had vowed to return to the facility to kill Ahmed — even leaving a series of email, text and phone threats — and tried to make good Friday on his chilling pledge. 
 
 By luck, Ahmed was not working Friday. 
 
 Instead, Bello, dressed in a white medical coat to conceal an AM-15 rifle, spotted Dr. Roger Green on the 16

Statement from the board says move is a step towards justice for victims ‘silenced by Harvey Weinstein’ 
 
 US film and TV studio The Weinstein Company, whose ex-chairman Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault, said on Monday it has filed for bankruptcy with an offer from an affiliate of private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners to acquire its assets. 
 
 
 
 Crucially, the company also said it was releasing all employees from non-disclosure agreements. 
 
 “Today, the Company also takes an important step toward justice for any victims who have been silenced by Harvey Weinstein,” read the statement. 
 
 “Since October, it has been reported that Harvey Weinstein used non-disclosure agreements as a secret weapon to silence his accusers. Effective immediately, those ‘agreements’ end.

 “No one should be afraid to speak out or coerced to stay quiet. The Company thanks the courageous individuals who have already come forward. Your voices have inspired a movement for change across the country and around the world.” 
 
 The step had long been sought by New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who filed a lawsuit against the company last month on behalf of its employees. Schneiderman called the move “a watershed moment”. 
 
 Eric Schneiderman (@AGSchneiderman) The Weinstein Company's agreement to release victims of and witnesses to sexual misconduct from NDAs will finally allow voices that have too long been muzzled to be heard—something my office has sought from the start. My statement: https://t.co/sfkzkYJ5xz pic.twitter.com/gmxGmPDX8d 
 
 The Weinstein Company, which has about 100 employees, filed for bankruptcy, listing $500m to $1bn in liabilities and $500m to $1bn in assets. 
 
 The studio’s bankruptcy comes after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor. The company inked a deal with an investor group led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, but the group terminated its offer earlier this month after seeing that the company had more liabilities than previously disclosed. 
 
 Weinstein Co said in a statement it entered into a “stalking horse” agreement with a Lantern Capital affiliate, that would purchase substantially all of the assets of the company. 
 
 The offer from Lantern will set the floor for higher and better bidders in a court-supervised auction. 
 
 Lions Gate Entertainment Corp had made an earlier offer for some of the company’s assets, as had Qatar-owned film company Miramax, which was founded by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein. Both could be among potential bidders in the auction.

 More than 70 women accused the company’s co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, who was one of Hollywood’s most influential men, of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. 
 
 Movie producer Killer Content also said bankruptcy would be the best option for the company, and that it may be interested in the studio’s assets in a bankruptcy auction. 
 
 Launched in October 2005, the studio produced and distributed critically acclaimed hits including The King’s Speech and Silver Linings Playbook, as well as TV series such as long-running fashion reality competition Project Runway. 
 
 Reuters contributed to this report ||||| The Weinstein Co. is now seeking the protection of bankruptcy court. The announcement of the filing marks the latest turn in a stunning fall for the prestigious indie studio responsible for many award-winning films, but now embroiled in a transformative controversy thanks to several dozen women who have come forward in recent months to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of rampant sexual misconduct. 
 
 The bankruptcy petition in Delaware will position Lantern Asset Management as the stalking horse bidder for Weinstein Co. assets after coming to a purchase agreement. Other companies will be able to bid at an auction after a bankruptcy judge reviews the bidding procedure and any objections. 
 
 “While we had hoped to reach a sale out of court, the Board is pleased to have a plan for maximizing the value of its assets, preserving as many jobs as possible and pursuing justice for any victims,” chairman Bob Weinstein said Monday in a statement. 
 
 Texas-based Lantern was previously part of the Ron Burkle-Maria Contreras-Sweet bid to buy the company that was scuttled last month. 
 
 “We are honored to be selected as the bidder to acquire the company’s businesses as an ongoing concern," stated Lantern co-founders Andy Mitchell and Milos Brajovic. "In the last several months, Lantern has evaluated the company and is proud to provide a solution to the board.”

These have been trying times for Siri. 
 
 Not only has she been having to work overtime answering mundane questions posed by those with nothing better to think or do, she's even been helping Santa get off his large, lazy bottom and do his job. 
 
 It is, perhaps, unsurprising that she seems to have finally lost her temper. For, as 12-year-old Charlie Le Quesne picked up a demonstration iPhone 4S in a branch of Tesco in the UK, Siri finally let her frustrations out. (Yes, I know she puts on a man's voice in the U.K., but that's just because the Brits have, well, certain issues.) 
 
 What lurks within Siri's temperamental soul? (Credit: Screenshot by Lance Whitney/CNET) 
 
 According to the Sun, the conversation went like this. 
 
 Le Quesne to Siri: "How many people are there in the world?" 
 
 Siri to Le Quesne: "Shut the f*** up, you ugly t***." 
 
 You might imagine that young Le Quesne's mom, Kim, was somewhat taken aback to hear someone in authority talk like that. 
 
 She told the Sun (I know, I know): "I thought I must be hearing things. So we asked again and the same four-letter stuff blared out." 
 
 I am in at least two minds to reveal how it was that Siri might have suddenly turned Smutti. However, the staff at Tesco reportedly said that some amusing individual had entered this rather inelegant phrase as the user's name in the set-up instructions. 
 
 Oh, what have we started here? 
 
 Tesco, somewhat unused to this level of controversy in its pristine stores, told the Sun that the company had launched an investigation and had sent the phone back to Apple to be diagnosed. 
 
 Which leaves just one question dangling about one's lips: Where might the phone have been tampered with? Might it have been in the store itself? 
 
 Or might someone, somewhere along the manufacturing and delivery process, have decided that this was the way to make for a fun Christmas? ||||| When it comes to the iPhone 4S's voice-controlled personal assistant Siri, you'd better be careful what you ask for. 
 
 "I thought I must be hearing things," Le Quesne's mother told the Sun. But when they asked again "the same four-letter stuff blared out." 
 
 CNET's Chris Matyszczyk offered a tongue-in-cheek explanation for the outburst: that Siri had lost patience answering mundane questions and had "finally lost her temper." 
 
 According to the store's managers, however, Siri may have been tricked by a group of pranksters into thinking the rude phrase was in fact the name of its owner. Apparently, this can be done in the set-up instructions. Why Siri would answer the question of how many people are in the world with the phone owner's name, however, is another question. 
 
 Of course we already knew that Siri has a somewhat dark sense of humor. S*** That Siri Says is a whole blog devoted to the A.I.'s amusing answers to straight-forward questions and straight answers to strange questions. When one iPhone owner told Siri, "I need to bury a body," she responded with a list of possibilities that included reservoirs, metal foundries, mines, dumps and swamps. While Siri's answers might verge on snarky at times (try asking it to marry you), they stay clear of R-rated territory. Ask it to "talk dirty to me," and Siri replies, "Humus. Compost. Pumice. Silt. Gravel." 
 
 In addition, it was discovered that Siri showed an apparent preference for pro-life pregnancy centers over clinics that provided abortions. Although at the time an Apple spokesperson told The New York Times, "These are not intentional omissions meant to offend anyone. It simply means that as we bring Siri from beta to a final product, we find places where we can do better, and we will in the coming weeks."

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - (This October 3 story has been refiled to Corrects detention period to four weeks, not four months, in seventh paragraph.)

 A Danish inventor charged with murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall in his home-made submarine had video footage on his computer showing women being violently killed, a court heard on Tuesday. 
 
 A police prosecutor said officers found images “which we presume to be real” of women being strangled and decapitated on the hard drive on Peter Madsen’s computer in a laboratory he ran. 
 
 That, together with new post-mortem evidence showing Wall was stabbed in her ribcage and genitals “around or shortly after her death,” was adding to the case against Madsen, the prosecutor, Jakob Buch-Jepsen, told the Copenhagen court. 
 
 DNA tests from Madsen’s nails, face and neck showed a clear match with Wall’s, Buch-Jepsen said, though the exact cause of death remained unknown. “Our suspicion hasn’t changed, it has been strengthened since (the last hearing on) September 5,” he added. 
 
 Madsen, who denies murdering Wall and another charge of mutilating her body, appeared in court via video link dressed in a green boilersuit. 
 
 He said the computer searched by police was not his. “They are the space laboratory’s tools which have been used by everyone in the laboratory,” he said. The court heard he had been working on building a space rocket in the lab. 
 
 He remained calm during the pre-trial session, sitting with his hands folded most of the time. The court ordered him detained for another four weeks as investigations continued. 
 
 Wall, a 30-year-old freelance journalist who was researching a story on Madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in the 17-metre (56-foot) craft in August. 
 
 Madsen has told the court in past hearings Wall died accidentally, saying she was hit by a heavy hatch cover on his UC3 Nautilus submarine. 
 
 On August 23, police identified a headless female torso washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall’s. 
 
 Madsen has also denied amputating her limbs, saying he tried to bury her whole body at sea. ||||| Cause of journalist’s death yet to be established, court hears, as murder suspect Peter Madsen’s custody is extended 
 
 The suspected killer of Swedish journalist Kim Wall will be detained for four more weeks after a Copenhagen court heard that 15 stab wounds had been found on her body. 
 
 Peter Madsen, 46, faces a murder charge over the death of the 30-year-old journalist, whose headless, dismembered torso was found floating off Denmark’s capital city 10 days after she boarded the inventor’s self-built submarine for an interview. 
 
 
 
 Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen told the court that cause of death had not yet been formally established, but that the multiple knife wounds had been inflicted “at the time of death or shortly afterwards”. 
 
 Traces of Madsen’s DNA had also been also recovered from Wall’s body, as well as traces of a saw blade consistent with the removal of her head and limbs after her death, Buch-Jepsen said. An examination of Madsen’s computer had also uncovered material featuring women being tortured and killed. 
 
 Madsen, who denies killing Wall, took part in the half-hour custody hearing with his lawyer via a video link from Copenhagen’s Vestre prison. He said he was “not the only person” with access to the computer in his workshop, and the extreme content did not belong to him. 
 
 His defence lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, said the court had heard “nothing that supports Kim Wall being killed by my client”. No investigations had been carried out to substantiate Madsen’s claim that the journalist died in an accident and that her body was still intact when he disposed of it at sea, she said. 
 
 Madsen told a hearing last month that the journalist died when a 70kg hatch cover fell on her head while she was climbing on to the deck of the surfaced submarine. “It was a terrible accident, a disaster,” he said. 
 
 Feeling “suicidal”, he attached a metal weight around her waist so her body would sink, and planned to sink his submarine, taking his own life, he said. “In my shock I thought it was the right thing to do,” he told the court.

 Thune, who beat Democratic Majority Leader Tom Daschle to win his Senate seat in 2004, has been thinking about a presidential bid for months — but his inquiries were tepid compared to other more organized candidates. Earlier this month, he was tapped to serve on the powerful Finance Committee — and with Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) set to retire next year, there is space for Thune to move up the ranks of the Senate leadership. 
 
 The South Dakotan had made clear in recent weeks that he lacked any burning desire to get on the campaign trail. “I like where I am," Thune said in an interview with POLITICO earlier this month. "I like what I do. These committee assignments are obviously going to give me a full portfolio for the foreseeable future. ... I’m in a place where I think I can make a difference. 
 
 He told confidantes there are three main reasons for his decision: his role in the Senate, his family and the timing. 
 
 "In 2012, there are a slew of Democratic seats that are up, and you could see the Senate flip. I think he wants to help his Senate colleagues win back the majority," top Republican fundraiser Gregory Slayton told POLITICO. Slayton, now based at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business in New Hampshire, has been speaking with Thune regularly for weeks. 
 
 Thune told Slayton he had to consider his family's role in a grueling presidential campaign — a sentiment that Thune expressed in his POLITICO interview when he said his wife had read "Game Change," an account of the 2008 campaign. 
 
 "It was not helpful,” he joked, calling the book a “downer.” 
 
 The third problem: timing. "Is this the right time in John's political career? With Kyl retiring, there are further opportunities for him in the Senate — and not just general Senate responsibilities but the overall role he might play," Slayton said. ||||| News

 Statement from John and Kimberley Thune Posted: February 22nd 2011 For months now, my wife Kimberley and I have received encouragement from family, friends, colleagues, and supporters from across South Dakota and the country to run for the presidency of the United States. We have appreciated hearing their concerns about where the country is headed and their hopes for a new direction. 
 
 
 
 During this time, Kimberley and I and our two daughters have given a great deal of thought to how we might best serve South Dakota and our nation. That process has involved lots of prayer. 
 
 
 
 Along the way, we have been reminded of the importance of being in the arena, of being in the fight. And make no mistake that during this period of fiscal crisis and economic uncertainty there is a fight for the future direction of America. There is a battle to be waged over what kind of country we are going to leave our children and grandchildren and that battle is happening now in Washington, not two years from now. So at this time, I feel that I am best positioned to fight for America’s future here in the trenches of the United States Senate. 
 
 
 
 I want to thank those who have encouraged us and prayed for us during the past several months. We are forever grateful for all the support.

If you can't attend, please say a little prayer for her family and wear something purple for her. #TeamJahi #FlyHighJahi ||||| OAKLAND, CA (FOX NEWS) - In her first public update in over three months, Jahi’s mother, Nailah Winkfield, released a photo on Facebook informing her followers of Jahi’s status, stating that she sees changes in her daughter that “Jahi as healthy and beautiful as ever, proving the naysayers wrong. A fighter, A warrior, A blessed child, Gods got your back little girl, keep fighting.” 
 
 In the letter, Winkfield also thanked everyone who had supported her as she fought to move her daughter to another medical facility. 
 
 “Your testimony will be a great one. Prayers going up from many, all the prayers, good wishes combined with your mothers love for you which is pure and soothing will definitely keep you going. Stay blessed everyone and thank you for your prayers and love.” 
 
 In January 2014, Jahi was at the center of an intense legal battle between her family and Children’s Hospital Oakland in California. Although experts at the hospital had declared Jahi brain dead, her family refused to have her removed from life support and fought to have her transferred to another hospital. After raising nearly $50,000 in private donations, the family eventually had Jahi moved to an unidentified long-term care facility. 
 
 Winkfield said that the intense media response surrounding her family’s legal struggle ultimately helped to raise awareness of Jahi’s condition. 
 
 “I also want to thank those who felt the need to go public with their opinions about me and my daughter, positive and even negative,” Winkfield wrote in previous Facebook update. “It is because of you that my daughter's experience is so relevant and that people all over the world know who Jahi Mcmath is. What you may not know is that her name, Jahi, means one who is known by many. Hopefully my daughter can change some of the ways brain death is viewed in today's society. Honestly, I think she already has.” 
 
 
 
 Many medical experts have argued that being brain dead essentially means being dead, and it may be just a matter of time before Jahi’s body functions shut down completely. 
 
 According to Dr. Paul Vespa, director of neurocritical care at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has no role in Jahi's care, brain-dead people may look like they're sleeping, but it's "an illusion based on advanced medical techniques." 
 
 The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| FRANKLIN TWP. -- A California girl being cared for in New Jersey after being declared brain dead more than two years ago is "as healthy and beautiful as ever, proving the naysayers wrong," her family said last week in a Facebook post. 
 
 The post, which included a picture of 15-year-old Jahi McMath and her mother, Nailah Winkfield, was published on March 15 on the "Keep Jahi McMath on life support" Facebook page. 
 
 "Jahi as healthy and beautiful as ever, proving the naysayers wrong," the post reads. "A fighter, A warrior, A blessed child, Gods got your back little girl, keep fighting. Your testimony will be a great one. 
 
 "Prayers going up from many, all the prayers, good wishes combined with your mothers love for you which is pure and soothing will definitely keep you going. Stay blessed everyone and thank you for your prayers and love." 
 
 After entering UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland in December 2013 for a routine tonsillectomy to correct her sleep apnea, McMath went into cardiac arrest and sustained massive, irreversible brain injuries. 
 
 Doctors later declared her brain dead and sought to turn off her life-support, but McMath's family ultimately obtained a restraining order preventing the hospital from terminating her life support. 
 
 Her family transported McMath in 2014 to New Jersey, because the state has a religious exemption for those who object to terminating medical support based on a brain death diagnosis. The family has been living in Franklin Township, Somerset County. 
 
 McMath's family is suing the hospital over the allegedly botched surgery and accusing officials of pressuring them to donate Jahi's organs. Winkfield, her mother, also has filed a federal lawsuit to get her daughter's death certificate declared void.

 WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump has returned to his West Palm Beach golf course on another sunny Florida day. 
 
 Trump began his Friday on Twitter, saying Democrats and Republicans "MUST come together, finally, with a major Border Security package, which will include funding for the Wall." 
 
 He says it's "time for action," even though the idea is opposed by many Democrats, who recently won control of the House. 
 
 Trump also calls on Congress to pass criminal justice reform legislation. He says Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer "have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country." 
 
 But Trump tweeted at the wrong account, tagging a Schumer fan instead of the senator. 
 
 For Thanksgiving, Trump called troops, answered reporters' questions, visited a Coast Guard station and had dinner at his Mar-a-Lago club. ||||| President Trump Donald John TrumpAmazon's European workers go on strike for Black Friday GOP makes inroads with Hispanics in Florida Romney to host PAC fundraiser: report MORE in an early-morning tweet the day after Thanksgiving demanded funding for a wall at the southern border as part of a "major Border Security package."

 Trump has kept the door open to a potential government shutdown if an upcoming deal to fund parts of the government does not include funding for a border wall. Congress has until Dec. 7 to fund the rest of the government after lawmakers punted on seven of the 12 individual funding bills before the end-of-the-fiscal-year deadline. 
 
 Trump over the summer had struck a less bipartisan tone as he told Republican lawmakers to "stop wasting their time" trying to work with Democrats on immigration until they took back more seats in the House and Senate. 
 
 But the GOP lost the House in this month's midterm elections, and liberal lawmakers are vehemently opposed to funding Trump's long-promised border wall. 
 
 Trump in another tweet touted "bipartisan" possibilities for his other legislative priority, criminal justice reform. 
 
 The criminal justice reform bill that Trump has been touting has caused divisions within the GOP. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told the president last week that he did not believe there would be enough floor time to pass the measure in the lame-duck session. |||||

The brunette suspect — described as white, in her 20s or 30s, 5-foot-8 and 130 pounds — is believed to have knocked over six stores in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and North Carolina since April. 
 
 The most recent heist was Monday at a Jared Vault in Mebane, North Carolina, the FBI said. She forced two workers into a back room at gunpoint, zip-tied their hands and then piled jewelry from the cases into a shopping bag. 
 
 A male suspect — black, in his 30s or 40s, 6 feet and 250 pounds — was caught on surveillance cameras in three of the robberies. 
 
 "Both suspects are considered armed and dangerous," the FBI said. 
 
 Anyone with information about the suspects is asked to call 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324). ||||| MEBANE, N.C. (WXII/WNCN) — A woman authorities believe has robbed jewelry stores across the Southeast, including one in North Carolina Monday, may be working with an accomplice. 
 
 The FBI on Tuesday released several photographs of the woman and of a man believed to be working with her. 
 
 A woman may be the same one who hit five jewelry store robberies in the South — netting more than $450,000 worth of goods — and then robbed a jewelry store Monday at Tanger Outlets in Mebane. 
 
 The incident was reported around 10:30 a.m. at the Jared Vault at 4000 Arrowhead Boulevard. No one was injured. 
 
 She may be working with a man caught on camera during robberies in Panama City Beach, Florida, and Dawsonville, Georgia. 
 
 Mebane police said the woman showed a handgun and ordered the employees to a back room before tying them up with zip-ties. In previous robberies of jewelry stores, the woman also showed a gun and tied up workers at the stores with zip-ties. 
 
 The woman fled with an undisclosed amount of merchandise, but so far has stolen more than $450,000 worth of jewelry in the six total robberies, officials say. 
 
 Police released a surveillance image of the suspect. She stands about 5 feet 8, weighs about 120 pounds and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said. 
 
 The same woman may be involved in similar robberies in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, police said. 
 
 Before Monday, the last jewelry store she robbed was in mid-October in Tennessee. 
 
 Officials are also investigating similar robberies of jewelry stores in Florida, South Carolina and two in Georgia. 
 
 In October, authorities say the woman went into Reeds Jewelers in Panama City Beach, Florida with a gun. In this case, she told two store employees to go to the store’s restroom where she zip-tied their hands, just like in Sevierville, before getting away with more than $400,000 worth of jewels. 
 
 Police say she pulls out a gun and forces employees into the back where she then ties them up before stealing the jewelry. 
 
 The first robbery was a Jared in Woodstock, Georgia. The next robbery was at a Zales in Dawsonville, Georgia. There she stole jewelry worth $13,000. 
 
 A week later a woman robbed a Reeds in Panama City Beach. She hit that one for $40,000. 
 
 The next store hit was a Jared Vault in Tanger Outlet Two in Bluffton, South Carolina. The thief was described as wearing a blue or purple striped skirt, a lavender and black brimmed hat according to WJCL. 
 
 Police are trying to figure out if the robberies were committed by the same woman. 
 
 The methods are similar and all the stores that were robbed were chain stores at large retail shopping/ entertainment plazas. 
 
 If you can identify the woman, know her whereabouts or have any other information that can help investigators, you’re asked to call Mebane police at 919-563-9031 or Alamance County Crime Stoppers at 336-229-7100.

Story highlights O'Grady on Tuesday declined to comment to CNN on the postings 
 
 Secret Service personnel on multiple occasions have rushed to protect Trump 
 
 Washington (CNN) The Secret Service said Tuesday it is taking "appropriate action" after one of its agents suggested on Facebook that she would not defend President Donald Trump should someone try to shoot him. 
 
 Kerry O'Grady, a senior agent in the Denver field office, made a series of now-deleted postings on Facebook during the campaign saying that she supported Democrat Hillary Clinton and that she would not honor a federal law that prevents agents like her from airing their political beliefs publicly. O'Grady deleted the posts shortly after The Washington Examiner reported them on Tuesday. 
 
 "As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act. So I keep quiet and skirt the median," she wrote in one Facebook post, as reported by the Examiner. "To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides." 
 
 "But this world has changed and I have changed. And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her," she wrote. 
 
 The Secret Service said in a statement Tuesday that it could not comment on a specific personnel matter but that it was "aware of the postings and the agency is taking quick and appropriate action."

 Despite her senior security role, she has made her disdain for Trump and his incoming administration clear to her Facebook followers, who included current and former Secret Service agents and other people who were employees at the time of the posts. O'Grady's posts triggered at least one complaint to the office that oversees investigations into Secret Service misbehavior, two knowledgeable sources told the Washington Examiner. 
 
 In one Facebook post O'Grady wrote at 11:07 p.m. on a Sunday in October, she endorsed Hillary Clinton and said she would endure "jail time" rather than "taking a bullet" for what she regarded as a "disaster" for America. 
 
 The post didn't mention Trump by name but clearly referred to him. 
 
 In the same post, she mentioned the Hatch Act, which bars executive branch staff, except the president, vice president and some other senior executive officials, from engaging in certain political activities. 
 
 "As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act. So I keep quiet and skirt the median," she wrote. "To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides. 
 
 "But this world has changed and I have changed. And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her." 
 
 Secret Service employees are among those federal employees subject to enhanced Hatch Act restrictions, including these two rules: 
 
 May not post a comment to a blog or a social media site that advocates for or against a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group. 
 
 May not use any email account or social media to distribute, send or forward content that advocates for or against a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group. 
 
 Asked for comment, the U.S. Secret Service responded: "The USSS is aware of the postings and we are looking into the matter." 
 
 In a lengthy interview with the Washington Examiner Monday, O'Grady said she took down the post after two to three days of greater reflection and

 Mountain View, CA 94043 
 
 Document Number: GEN1300666 
 
 Re: Personal Genome Service (PGS) 
 
 WARNING LETTER 
 
 Dear Ms. Wojcicki, 
 
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is sending you this letter because you are marketing the 23andMe Saliva Collection Kit and Personal Genome Service (PGS) without marketing clearance or approval in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act). 
 
 This product is a device within the meaning of section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(h), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or function of the body. For example, your company’s website at www.23andme.com/health (most recently viewed on November 6, 2013) markets the PGS for providing “health reports on 254 diseases and conditions,” including categories such as “carrier status,” “health risks,” and “drug response,” and specifically as a “first step in prevention” that enables users to “take steps toward mitigating serious diseases” such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer. Most of the intended uses for PGS listed on your website, a list that has grown over time, are medical device uses under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act. Most of these uses have not been classified and thus require premarket approval or de novo classification, as FDA has explained to you on numerous occasions. 
 
 Some of the uses for which PGS is intended are particularly concerning, such as assessments for BRCA-related genetic risk and drug responses (e.g., warfarin sensitivity, clopidogrel response, and 5-fluorouracil toxicity) because of the potential health consequences that could result from false positive or false negative assessments for high-risk indications such as these. For instance, if the BRCA-related risk assessment for breast or ovarian cancer reports a false positive, it could lead a patient to undergo prophylactic surgery, chemoprevention, intensive screening, or other morbidity-inducing actions, while a false negative could result in a failure to recognize an actual risk that may exist. Assessments for drug responses carry the risks that patients relying on such tests may begin to self-manage their treatments through dose changes or even abandon certain therapies depending on the outcome of the assessment. For example, false genotype results for your warfarin drug response test could have significant unreasonable risk of illness, injury, or death to the patient due to thrombosis or bleeding events that occur from treatment with a drug at a dose that does not provide the appropriately calibrated anticoagulant effect. These risks are typically mitigated by International Normalized Ratio (INR) management under a physician’s care. The risk of serious injury or death is known to be high when patients are either non-compliant or not properly dosed; combined with the risk that a direct-to-consumer test result may be used by a patient to self-manage, serious concerns are raised if test results are not adequately understood by patients or if incorrect test results are reported. 
 
 Your company submitted 510(k)s for PGS on July 2, 2012 and September 4, 2012, for several of these indications for use. However, to date, your company has failed to address the issues described during previous interactions with the Agency or provide the additional information identified in our September 13, 2012 letter for (b)(4) and in our November 20, 2012 letter for (b)(4), as required under 21 CFR 807.87(1). Consequently, the 510(k)s are considered withdrawn, see 21 C.F.R. 807.87(1), as we explained in our letters to you on March 12, 2013 and May 21, 2013. To date, 23andMe has failed to provide adequate information to support a determination that the PGS is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate for any of the uses for which you are marketing it; no other submission for the PGS device that you are marketing has been provided under section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C.  ⁇  360(k). 
 
 The Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health (OIR) has a long history of working with companies to help them come into compliance with the FD&C Act. Since July of 2009, we have been diligently working to help you comply with regulatory requirements regarding safety and effectiveness and obtain marketing authorization for your PGS device. FDA has spent significant time evaluating the intended uses of the PGS to determine whether certain uses might be appropriately classified into class II, thus requiring only 510(k) clearance or de novo classification and not PM

 OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — The Golden State Warriors somehow withstood LeBron James' latest brilliance on the NBA Finals stage. 
 
 A costly blunder by J.R. Smith and a disputed foul call involving James himself sure helped. 
 
 Stephen Curry scored 29 points and the Warriors capitalized on Smith's mistake that sent the game into overtime, overcoming a 51-point performance by James to beat Cleveland 124-114 in Game 1 on Thursday night. 
 
 The game nearly over, James jawed with both Curry and Klay Thompson, then Tristan Thompson and Draymond Green tangled moments later and made contact. After replay review, Tristan Thompson received a Flagrant 2 foul and ejection with 2.6 seconds left. 
 
 James was in utter disbelief as regulation ended stunningly: George Hill made the first of two free throws with 4.7 seconds left after being fouled by Klay Thompson, but when Smith secured the rebound of the second, he dribbled back toward halfcourt instead of shooting, apparently thinking the Cavs had a lead. 
 
 "He thought it was over. He thought we were up one," coach Tyronn Lue said. 
 
 Yet Smith insisted he knew the score. Green figured Smith was simply looking for James, saying, "I would have looked for LeBron, too." 
 
 "I just thought we were going to call a timeout. Because I got the rebound, I'm pretty sure I couldn't shoot it over KD," Smith said of Kevin Durant. "If I thought we were ahead, I would have just held on to the ball so they could foul me. Clearly that wasn't the case." 
 
 Instead, OT. 
 
 And why not? Both these teams were pushed to their limits in seven-game conference finals they each had to win on the road. 
 
 "I can't talk about a situation that way because I do some dumb stuff on the court," Durant said of how the fourth quarter finished. "I don't know what was going through J.R.'s head. He made a great rebound and gave them an opportunity

Artificial sweeteners, such as those contained in diet drinks, don’t actually help people lose weight, a new Canadian study suggests. In fact, they appear to be linked to weight gain and an increased risk of diabetes. 
 
 Dr. Meghan Azad and a team of researchers of the University of Manitoba conducted a meta-review of 37 previously published studies that looked at the diet habits of more than 400,000 people. 
 
 The team found no good evidence that regularly consuming artificial sweeteners led to weight loss. In fact, the longer observational studies showed a link between the sweeteners and higher risks of weight gain and obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other health issues. 
 
 The full results appear in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ). 
 
 Azad said what her team was most struck by was the lack of good, rigorous studies on artificial sweeteners. 
 
 “Surprisingly, given how common these products are, not many studies have looked at the long-term impact of their consumption,” Azad told CTV News Channel from Lisbon, Portugal. 
 
 She noted that only seven of the 37 studies they reviewed were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and all were relatively short, following participants for a median period of only six months. 
 
 The other 30 studies were longer and followed the participants for an average of 10 years, but they were observational studies – a form of research that is not as precise as a controlled trial. 
 
 “A lot of the studies we found were observational, meaning they could show a link but they can’t prove a cause-and-effect relationship,” she said. 
 
 Among the seven RCT’s, regular consumption of sweeteners had no significant effect on weight loss. From the other studies, the team found that regular use of sweeteners was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, and modest increases in weight and waist circumferences. 
 
 “What we found was that at the end of the day, from all of this research, there really wasn’t firm evidence of a long-term benefit of artificial sweeteners. And there was some evidence of long-term harm from long-term consumption,” Azad said. 
 
 As for why artificial sweeteners seem to be linked to weight gain, not weight loss, Azad says no one knows for sure but there are lots of theories. 
 
 One theory is that the sweeteners somehow disrupt healthy gut bacteria. Another theory is that the sweeteners confuse our metabolisms, causing them to overreact to sugary tastes. 
 
 It could be that those who regularly use artificial sweeteners over-compensate for the missed calories from sugar, or they could have otherwise unhealthy diets in conjunction with sweetener use. 
 
 Azad would like to see a lot more research on the long-term use of sweeteners, in particular studies that could compare the different sweeteners, to see if one is any better than another. 
 
 In the meantime, for those trying to cut down on their sugar consumption, Azad says it’s important not to switch from one harmful food item to another. 
 
 “I think the takeaway for Canadians at this point is to maybe think twice about whether you really want to be consuming these artificial sweeteners, particularly on an everyday basis,” Azad said, “because really we don’t have evidence to say for sure whether these are truly harmless alternatives to sugar.” ||||| Consumers may want to think twice about relying on artificial sweeteners, says a Manitoba researcher who found no evidence the sweeteners help with weight loss and some potential health harm beyond the waistline. 
 
 People are increasingly consuming artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and sucralose as well as the non-nutritive sweetener stevioside, derived from the stevia plant. The sweeteners are widespread in food and drinks including diet soda, yogurt, sauces and dressings and baked goods. 
 
 Health sciences Prof. Meghan Azad was one of them, reaching for the low-calorie choices until she started researching them in detail. 
 
 "Over 40 per cent of adults are reporting using artificial sweeteners on a regular basis," said Azad. "We know a lot of people are consuming them in foods and not realizing it." 
 
 In Monday's issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Azad and her co-authors scrutinize 30 observational studies that followed more than 400,000 people in the general population for about a decade, as well as seven randomized trials of about 1,000 people with obesity who were followed for an average of six months. 
 
 While those who are obese were trying to use the artificial or non-nutritive sweeteners as part of weight-loss program, Azad found no consistent benefits in helping the needle go down on the scale or slimming the waist. 
 
 No clear benefit, potential for harm 
 
 What's more, studies on those consuming artificial sweeteners routinely suggest the intake may be associated with cardiovascular disease events such as

FAIRFIELD, Texas (AP) — A man suspected of killing a Texas state trooper during a traffic stop was taken into custody more than 100 miles away, authorities said Thursday night. 
 
 The Harris County Sheriff's Office announced on Twitter that the suspect was apprehended in neighboring Waller County. The Texas Department of Public Safety and other law enforcement agencies had identified the suspect as Dabrett Black, 32, of Linsdale, Texas. 
 
 DPS said the trooper was shot and killed before 4 p.m. Thursday during a traffic stop on Interstate 45 near Fairfield, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Dallas. The trooper was shot with a rifle and died at the scene, the agency said. The suspect then fled. 
 
 The trooper has not been identified. 
 
 Hours after the shooting, the Waller County Sheriff's Office said the suspect's vehicle was spotted in Hempstead, about 110 miles (177 kilometers) south of Fairfield. The sheriff's office said on its Facebook page that shots were fired, but did not indicate who opened fire. 
 
 The suspect was apprehended a short time later. 
 
 KYTX-TV reported in July that Black was charged with evading arrest, reckless driving and aggravated assault against a public servant following a police chase in Smith County. 
 
 Several Texas officials reacted to the trooper's death. In a tweet, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz offered "prayers for the family and loved ones" of the trooper. 
 
 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the trooper's killing a "heinous crime" in a statement Thursday. Abbott also expressed his "most sincere condolences" to the trooper's family. ||||| Tweet with a location

- A local college graduate is gaining popularity all over social media. 
 
 Daivon Reeder's photo has gone viral, but, it's his caption - that's catching everyone's attention. 
 
 "I was just sitting around and thinking about the things I went through to get here and to graduate," said Reeder. "That one thing stood out to me." 
 
 Daivon Reeder is getting ready to graduate from Eastern Michigan University with a major in Criminal Justice and a minor in Military Science, but if he listened to his stepfather he may not be here today. 
 
 "I kind of heard that and I was like ok, I'll show you," Reeder said. 
 
 As graduation day neared, Reeder tweeted - "My stepdad told me it was pointless to go to orientation I wasn't going to graduate anyway. 4 years later he is in jail and I am well..." 
 
 "I looked at the picture and the emoji of me laughing I thought that was an ironic situation - we are in two different situations in our lives," Reeder said. "Look what you said and look where you are at." 
 
 
 
 IN PHOTOS: Click here for a photo gallery. of Daivon Reeder. 
 
 His tweet has now gone viral - retweeted and shared thousands of times - with people congratulating Reeder for proving his stepdad wrong. 
 
 "I literally tweeted, I went to sleep, my phone was dead," he said. "I charged it and my phone went boom boom boom. I was like, Oh my gosh, what's going on. It's exciting, it really is." 
 
 But the 22-year-old from Detroit who is the first in his family to go to college, faced plenty of obstacles along the way. 
 
 "I came here on a scholarship," he said. "I ended up losing it, and then I had to go to basic training for the Army and I came back to work hard to get my scholarship back. 
 
 "I had family problems, I'm the oldest of all my brothers and sisters so I had to take care of my brothers and sisters back home. And I am a black male student in a predominately white university so that's a struggle in itself." 
 
 Reeder, who works two jobs to support his family, says he didn't have a father figure growing up. Instead of being angry, he and nine students formed an organization to mentor young boys, teach them what he had to learn the hard way. 
 
 "Living our values - live, learn, teach, knowing I was living life making mistakes," he said. "But I was learning from them able to teach someone else." 
 
 Reeder says he beat the statistics. 
 
 On Saturday, donning his cap and gown Reeder will walk with his entire EMU class and officially accept his diploma. 
 
 Reeder may be making headlines now - but it's clear his story is far from over. 
 
 "Just because somebody says you can't do something seems hard or it's not the norm, or it’s something your family is not used to doing, you can be the change," he said. "You can be the difference." ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

 Experimental findings show that people with desirable or attractive names are treated more favorably by others than are those with undesirable or unattractive names. Also, persons with undesirable or unattractive names tend to be handicapped in their personal, social, and work-related activities. Accordingly, it behooves parents to discover the impressions that will be generated by the names they select for their children. 
 
 Our large-scale surveys conducted for more than a decade identified desirable, attractive and beneficial names versus undesirable, unattractive, and harmful ones. Positive-negative impressions created by various types of names (e.g., given names vs. nicknames) are reported in the publications referenced below. In addition, "Baby Name Report Card" provides summary descriptions of impressions created by most commonly used names. In effect, the volume provides scientifically-based information for choosing baby names. It supplies guidelines for selecting names that will impart positive and beneficial, rather than negative and harmful, impressions to others; that is, names that will be assets rather than liabilities throughout a lifetime. It also includes useful information for adults who are dissatisfied with their first or last names and would like to assume new names. 
 
 Ethical-Caring (e.g., trustworthy, loyal, sincere, kind, generous, respectful, warm, patient, responsible) 
 
 Popular-Fun (e.g., playful, humorous, cheerful, outgoing, good-looking, adventurous, athletic, healthy) 
 
 Successful (e.g., ambitious, intelligent, independent, confident, assertive, creative) 
 
 Masculine-Feminine 
 
 Overall Attractiveness (a statistical combination of the first three dimensions) 
 
 Average ratings from all respondents who rated a given name are summarized using scores that range from zero to 100, with 50 being an average score. For example, "John" received an average Success score of 98 (extremely high) whereas "Knut" received a Success score of 11 (extremely low). These two names differ substantially in terms of the impression of Success (which includes connotations of intelligence, creativity, ambition) they impart.

Getty Al Gore not planning to run against Hillary, advisers say 
 
 Despite some hopeful speculation among Democrats that Al Gore might jump into the 2016 presidential race in the face of Hillary Clinton’s troubles, people close to the former vice president and Democratic nominee say he’s not considering it. 
 
 “There’s no truth to it. He’s laser-focused on solving the climate crisis," Gore spokeswoman Betsy McManus told POLITICO Thursday evening. 
 
 Story Continued Below 
 
 Earlier Thursday, Buzzfeed News posted a story saying that “supporters” of Gore “have begun a round of conversations among themselves and with the former vice president about his running for president in 2016, the latest sign that top Democrats have serious doubts that Hillary Clinton is a sure thing.” The story quoted a “senior Democrat” as saying “they’re getting the old gang together” and “figuring out if there’s a path financially and politically,” and the article cited “a member of Gore’s inner circle” who “asked to be quoted ‘pouring lukewarm water’ — not, note, cold water — on the chatter.” 
 
 But Mike Feldman, who was Gore’s traveling chief of staff during the 2000 presidential election campaign and speaks to him regularly, says the speculation is probably just “Democrats talking to other Democrats. ... I’m not saying there’s nobody out there fantasizing about it, but I haven’t heard anything and I’d be pretty insulted if there were a group of Gore advisers meeting and I wasn’t invited. I just don’t think this is on his mind.” 
 
 In recent days other close Gore advisers have also told POLITICO that they have not heard of any interest from the 2000 Democratic nominee in another run. 
 
 One likely reason for the current speculation about Gore is that Clinton is facing new iterations of email-gate, flagging poll numbers and still-surging Bernie Sanders-mania, despite a conviction among many Democratic strategists that Sanders is not electable. And strategists know that if Clinton falters, there are probably only two tried-and-true Democratic candidates who can be considered experienced enough to step in: Vice President Joe Biden is one (and is said to be actively considering a run), and the other is Gore, Biden’s Democratic predecessor as veep. (A possible third might be 2004 loser John Kerry, with the current secretary of state now riding high over his diplomatic coup in Geneva to curtail Iran’s nuclear program.) 
 
 Gore has stayed entirely out of presidential politics since he won the popular vote but lost the White House 15 years ago. In a phone interview, Democratic strategist James Carville said while he also “hasn’t heard” anything from the Gore camp, he wouldn’t be surprised if Gore weren’t at least considering the possibilities. “Running for president is like having sex. No one did it once and forgot about it. If you can do it, you want to do it again, it’s something you don’t get out of your system.” He also noted this was a “very fluid cycle, and it’s still early in the process.” ||||| China Stringer Network / Reuters ID: 6604407 
 
 Supporters of Al Gore have begun a round of conversations among themselves and with the former vice president about his running for president in 2016, the latest sign that top Democrats have serious doubts that Hillary Clinton is a sure thing. 
 
 
 
 Gore, 67, won the popular vote in the 2000 election and has been mentioned as a possible candidate in every contested Democratic primary since then. He instead spent much of the 2000s focused on environmental campaigning and business ventures. He has largely slipped out of public view in more recent years. 
 
 But in recent days, “they’re getting the old gang together,” a senior Democrat told BuzzFeed News. 
 
 “They’re figuring out if there’s a path financially and politically,” the Democrat said. “It feels more real than it has in the past months.” 
 
 The senior Democrat and other sources cautioned not to overstate Gore’s interest. He has not made any formal or informal moves toward running, or even met with his political advisers about a potential run. 
 
 A member of Gore’s inner circle asked to be quoted “pouring lukewarm water” — not, note, cold water — on the chatter. 
 
 “This is people talking to people, some of whom may or may not have talked to him,” the Gore adviser said. 
 
 Roy Neel, a former top adviser to Gore, said Thursday he hadn’t spoken to Gore about it and dismissed the idea of a bid. “It’s extremely unlikely,” he said. 
 
 Gore himself didn’t immediately reply to an inquiry emailed to his personal account.

A report published on Right-wing news website WND on Friday, quoting a defected Iranian intelligence officer, claimed that a massive blast had ripped through the nuclear facility, buried deep within the guts of a large mountain. 
 
 The alleged blast was said to have erupted at 11.30am last Monday – on the eve of the Israeli election – partially destroyed the nuclear site and trapped 240 people underground. Tehran held Israel responsible, the report said. 
 
 More than a week later, the report is yet to be verified by a single independent source. If true, it would be the most significant attack on Iranian nuclear capabilities to date and could spark a fierce reaction from the Islamic State. 
 
 And yet on Sunday evening, Shamseddin Barbroudi, deputy head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation, assured Iranian reporters there had been no explosion at the nuclear facility whatsoever. 
 
 Earlier the same day, Avi Dichter, Israel's home defence minister, had been unable to confirm the unsubstantiated reports but nonetheless, welcomed them. "Any explosion in Iran that doesn't hurt people but hurts its assets is welcome," he said. 
 
 Speaking privately, officials in Israel's foreign ministry – known to have an extensive surveillance network monitoring Iran's key nuclear sites – claimed they had no reliable intelligence of an explosion at Fordow. 
 
 One theory put forward by Shlomo Aronson, an expert in Israeli foreign security policy at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, is that Tehran had deliberately leaked false reports about a blast to prevent international inspectors from entering the site. 
 
 "They [Tehran] are more than capable of inventing such a story – although if it's true, a damaged Fordow would definitely benefit Israel," Mr Aronson conceded. 
 
 "Israel would do anything within its power to stop the Iranian nuclear programme. This includes tactics that fall just short of, or substitute, a direct attack, such as the cyber war that has been raging for the past few years or acts of sabotage on Iran's nuclear facilities." 
 
 Buried 300 feet underground, the nuclear fortress at Fordow is immune to air strikes or bunker bombs. It contains more than 2,700 centrifuges enriching uranium to more than 20 per cent. 
 
 Tehran has repeatedly blamed Israel for a string of explosive disasters that have hit Iranian nuclear targets, including the death of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, one of Natanz's top nuclear scientists, killed when his car exploded in January last year. 
 
 Whilst pleading ignorance of last Monday's alleged blast, a senior Israeli official conceded that penetrating a fortified facility such as Fordow would be neither impossible nor without precedent for Israeli's intelligence services. 
 
 "Anything man-made, we can penetrate," one Israeli official told The Daily Telegraph. ||||| DUBAI | 
 
 DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran has denied media reports of a major explosion at one of its most sensitive uranium enrichment sites, describing them as Western propaganda designed to influence upcoming nuclear negotiations. 
 
 Reuters has been unable to verify reports since Friday of an explosion early last week at the underground Fordow bunker, near the religious city of Qom, that some Israeli and Western media have said caused significant damage. 
 
 "The false news of an explosion at Fordow is Western propaganda ahead of nuclear negotiations to influence their process and outcome," state news agency IRNA quoted the deputy head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, Saeed Shamseddin Bar Broudi, as saying late on Sunday. 
 
 Iran's ISNA news agency quoted military commander Massoud Jazayeri as saying: "I deny an explosion at the Fordow site." 
 
 In late 2011 the plant at Fordow began producing uranium enriched to 20 percent fissile purity, compared with the 3.5 percent level needed for nuclear energy plants. Several U.N. Security Council resolutions have ordered Iran to suspend all uranium enrichment. 
 
 Speculation of an explosion at Fordow followed an Iranian news agency report that global powers and Tehran could resume talks on Iran's disputed nuclear program on Monday and Tuesday. The European Union, the lead negotiator on the nuclear talks, said there was no such agreement. 
 
 Diplomats in Vienna, where the United Nations' nuclear agency is based, said on Monday they had no knowledge of any incident at Fordow but were looking into the reports. One Western diplomat said he did not believe them to be correct. 
 
 The U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which regularly inspects Iranian nuclear sites including Fordow, had no immediate comment. 
 
 Iran has accused Israel and the United States of trying to sabotage its nuclear program, which the West suspects hides an attempt to develop atom bomb capability. The Islamic republic says its atomic program is entirely peaceful.

 On Feb. 4, 2004, in his Harvard dorm room, Mark Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a website where college students could post information about themselves, trade messages, and become virtual “friends” with one another. It was entering an already-crowded field of social networks. Friendster was the world’s most popular at the time, but it was about to be overtaken by a one-year-old upstart called MySpace. Google had launched Orkut just weeks earlier. 
 
 Will Oremus Will Oremus is Slate’s senior technology writer. Email him at will.oremus@slate.com or follow him on Twitter. 
 
 Facebook was different because it was only for college students, featured a clean layout devoid of spam, and had no immediate plans to make money. It was an instant hit. “I assume I’ll eventually make something profitable,” Zuckerberg shrugged in a June 2004 interview with the Harvard student newspaper. (It took him a while, but Facebook turned its first profit in 2009, and last year it reported a profit of some $1.5 billion on nearly $8 billion in revenues.) 
 
 By December the site had 1 million users, and it hadn’t even added its photo-upload feature yet. Here’s what thefacebook.com looked like in 2005, a year after it launched:

 Over the years it piled on the features. Some, like News Feed and the like button, changed the Internet forever. Others, like Facebook Gifts, not so much. For its 10th birthday, Facebook has put together a timeline of significant events in its own history. It reflects a bit of a selective memory—you won’t find Gifts, Beacon, or the site’s short-lived experiment with democracy on this timeline. But then, that’s part of what made Facebook so appealing in the first place: the ability to edit your own image to your liking.

 The timeline is one of several features that Facebook released Monday night, on the eve of its anniversary. On Tuedsay it will unveil a product called “A Look Back” that lets users make a personal movie or slideshow of their favorite moments in their lives since they joined Facebook. The company also launched a slick new iPhone app, Paper, in the App Store on Monday. 
 
 
 
 Here’s Zuckerberg’s statement on the eve of his brainchild’s 10th birthday: 
 
 It's been an incredible journey so far, and I'm so grateful to be a part of it. It's been amazing to see how people have used Facebook to build a real community and help each other in so many ways. In the next decade, we have the opportunity and responsibility to connect everyone and to keep serving the community as best we can.

 ||||| When Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06 grew impatient with the creation of an official universal Harvard facebook, he decided to take matters into his own hands. 
 
 After about a week of coding, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com last Wednesday afternoon. The website combines elements of a standard House face book with extensive profile features that allow students to search for others in their courses, social organizations and Houses. 
 
 “Everyone’s been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard,” Zuckerberg said. “I think it’s kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week.” 
 
 As of yesterday afternoon, Zuckerberg said over 650 students had registered use thefacebook.com. He said that he anticipated that 900 students would have joined the site by this morning. 
 
 “I’m pretty happy with the amount of people that have been to it so far,” he said. “The nature of the site is that each user’s experience improves if they can get their friends to join it.” 
 
 But Director of Residential Computing Kevin S. Davis ’98 said that the creation of a Harvard facebook was not as far off as Zuckerberg predicted.

 “There is a project internally with computer services to create a facebook,” Davis said. “We’ve been in touch with the Undergraduate Council, and this is a very high priority for the College. We have every intention of completing the facebook by the end of the spring semester.” 
 
 Davis said that the principle complication with the creation of an official facebook was figuring out how to design an interface so that directory information could not easily be compiled without authorization.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A trade deal fight led by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday failed to fully materialize as rival and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton announced a compromise to expand mandatory healthcare funding over the next decade.

 At a meeting of the Democratic Party draft platform committee in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday, supporters of Sanders were unable to influence the committee to adopt strong language opposing the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, marking a powerful blow to the efforts by the U.S. senator from Vermont to push the party further to the left. 
 
 “We did everything we could to win that vote,” said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels. “It was very disappointing.” 
 
 Instead of a condemnation specific to the TPP, the committee reached language saying they would oppose “trade agreements that do not support good American jobs.” 
 
 Sanders has headed the effort on the U.S. left to oppose the TPP and trade deals like it, which he says are unfair to American workers. Clinton has also come out as opposed to the agreement. 
 
 Despite Clinton having already secured the requisite delegates to clinch the party’s nomination at the July 25-28 convention, Sanders remains in the race to be the party’s nominee. 
 
 He has indicated that he would hold off on endorsing Clinton for the Nov. 8 general election fight against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump until she adopted policies and campaign language that more closely resembled his own more liberal tone. 
 
 “I would like to say that while this vote was disappointing, we have won some tremendous victories,” Gunnels said, including securing language in the draft supporting a federal $15 minimum wage, another trademark issue for Sanders. 
 
 On the same day, the Clinton campaign announced changes to its healthcare policy proposal, including increasing mandatory healthcare funding under the Affordable Care Act by $40 billion over the next 10 years, highlighting the significant influence Sanders still yields over the party. 
 
 “We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable healthcare to everyone in America,” Clinton said in a statement that included her intention to give Americans the choice of a public-option insurance plan and allow for individuals below Medicare age, beginning at 55, to opt in to the U.S. federal program that pays elderly Americans’ hospital bills. 
 
 Sanders has made combating healthcare costs a rallying cry of his campaign and often battled with Clinton during the primary race on how best to reach their shared goal of universal healthcare. 
 
 On Saturday, Sanders praised the updates to Clinton’s proposal as a step in the right direction to “save lives and ease suffering,” indicating, along with the more liberal tone in several parts of the 2016 platform draft, a growing compromise between the two camps. 
 
 For Clinton, an endorsement from Sanders - seen as a champion of the progressive left - could open the door to many of his supporters who have been reluctant to support the more moderate Clinton. 
 
 “The proposal brought forth today by Secretary Clinton, working with our campaign, is an important step forward in expanding healthcare in America - and expanding health insurance and healthcare access to tens of millions of Americans,” he said in a statement.

 “I congratulate Secretary Clinton for this extremely important initiative.” 
 
 The New York Times reported on Thursday that an endorsement is imminent, and Sanders is expected to officially throw his support behind Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire early next week.

 WASHINGTON — Hillary Clinton on Saturday announced her plan to expand investments in community health care centers, the second of two proposals in a week apparently aimed at courting supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders ahead of his possible endorsement. 
 
 The presumptive Democratic nominee's proposal would double funding for primary care services at Federally Qualified Health Centers, which serve populations with limited access to health care. Community health care centers have been a key priority for Sanders, I-Vt., who successfully fought for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for such centers in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. 
 
 Clinton also affirmed her commitment to giving Americans in every state the choice of a "public-option" insurance plan

 DETROIT (CBS Detroit) Volunteers in Detroit and across the nation spent the night counting the homeless, and one of those men who lives in the cold is dealing with it in a, shall we say, unusual way. 
 
 He calls himself “Honest Abe” and he panhandles not just for pocket change, but also for the donor’s credit and debit cards. He accepts cards with a reader attached to his cell phone. 
 
 His real name is Abe Hagenston and he’s been homeless in Detroit for seven years or so. The 8 Mile overpass on I-75 is home. 
 
 Looking at that bleak, gray freeway facade with the wind whipping through, one could imagine he’s happy about the relatively mild winter metro Detroit has experienced so far this year. 
 
 Not so fast. 
 
 “It’s not really that easy, what we’re lacking is snow,” Abe told WWJ’s Mike Campbell. “Of course, there’s no snow removal. I used to look forward to that, doing some shoveling.” 
 
 Without the extra cash, he hasn’t made enough money this winter to buy new eyeglasses, he said, and he could use a new prescription. 
 
 But as a bonus, with the extra time Abe says he and a group of fellow homeless have organized themselves “like a union” to panhandle in shifts. He also used the extra time to figure out a way to make donations more efficient. Don’t have any change in your pocket? No problem. 
 
 “I take VISA, MasterCard, American Express,” Abe told Campbell. “I’m the only homeless guy in America who can take a credit card. It’s all done safely and securely through square.com.” 
 
 Square readers attach to credit cards and basically turn a smartphone into a card reader. They cost about $10 and square providers charge vendors a fee per transaction. In the case of itunes, the charge is 2.75 percent per transaction. 
 
 It’s unknown how many homeless occupy Detroit — or how many people have trusted Abe with their credit card information — but last year’s count of people who live on the streets of Detroit included a rough estimate of 2,700. 
 
 This year’s count isn’t ready yet, but people like Stacy Brackins, a case manager with mental health agency Detroit Central City spent the night cruising around town with gloves, hats, sleeping bags to count homeless men and women and try to encourage them to seek shelter. 
 
 Hundreds of volunteers were involved in the count. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the number of homeless in Michigan had declined 6 percent in the most recent report. There were an estimated 578,424 people experiencing homelessness across the country in 2014. 
 
 How many homeless were ready to accept offers of warmth and shelter in Detroit Wednesday night? Some were, others were not. 
 
 “Some, they just don’t want to come inside — they want their freedom,” Brackins told the Detroit Free Press. ||||| (CNN) Forget the old "I don't have change" excuse you give panhandlers. Abe Hagenston has an app for that. 
 
 Well, more like a card reader. He takes credit cards through Square as he works the corner of Woodward Avenue and 8 Mile Road in Detroit. 
 
 Oh, and he has a website too. 
 
 "Being homeless is my business now," Hagenston told CNN affiliate WDIV . "My business is being homeless." 
 
 On the web 
 
 Through his website, people can make contributions to a collection of homeless people, hire them for odd jobs or even report fake panhandlers who drive from the suburbs. 
 
 "I'm trying to turn this situation into something that will not only help me but help others," he said. 
 
 Hagenston's been on the streets for 10 years and goes by the name "Honest Abe." 
 
 "I've rebuilt my life a few times but this time I'm not getting it," he said. "People don't realize how tough it is to come from nothing when you don't have any family or any friends." ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Kanye West Checks Out of Hospital Back at Home 
 
 Kanye West Checks Out of Hospital 
 
 Exclusive Details 
 
 Kanye West is out of UCLA Medical Center after more than a week of treatment for his mental breakdown. 
 
 TMZ has confirmed Kanye is at home with Kim Kardashian and their kids. We're told he left the hospital under the care of Kim, and his personal physician, Dr. Michael Farzam ... who called 911 the day Kanye was admitted. 
 
 As we reported ... Kanye suffered what people close to him say was a "nervous breakdown," triggered in large part by the anniversary of his mother's funeral. 
 
 Our sources say Kanye is not out of the woods ... he needs ongoing psychological and medical treatment. 
 
 X17 first reported Kanye getting out. ||||| Kanye West and Kim Kardashian were struggling to keep up even before his November 21 hospitalization for extreme exhaustion. In the aftermath of the October 3 Paris robbery, during which Kardashian, 36, was tied up and held at gunpoint while thieves stole $10 million in jewelry, “it’s just been hell for them,” a source says in the new issue of Us Weekly. Find out more in the video above, and detailed below. 
 
 While the reality star struggled to feel safe again, West, 39, returned to his 63-date Saint Pablo tour. But Kardashian, normally a backstage fixture, was too anxious to tag along. “The trauma of the incident made her more hesitant to do things,” explains the source. “Of course it strained their relationship, because she hadn’t seen him.” 
 
 When he was home at their 11,000-square-foot Bel Air spread with kids North, 3, and Saint, 12 months, West’s workaholic tendencies got the best of him. “He would be up all night ranting about things,” says a source close to the 21-time Grammy winner. “They were fighting because he was impossible to live with.” 
 
 Kardashian’s Paris ordeal left West paranoid and “completely freaked out,” says an insider. The fact that it happened near the nine-year anniversary of the loss of his mother, Donda, only deepened his distress. “The mere thought of his wife being taken from him was too much — it was like his mother’s death,” says a source close to West. “Seeing Kim close to death did a major number on him. It sent him into a tailspin.” 
 
 Kardashian, meanwhile, was enduring her own nightmares and flashbacks, say sources. But when she tried to lean on her husband of two years, she was disappointed. “She felt like now she needed him to be stable and her rock instead of the other way around,” explains the Kim confidant. “Kanye’s so used to getting Kim’s constant support and coding, but it’s always about Kanye.” 
 
 But then — as she was preparing to attend the November 21 Angel Ball in New York — she got that fateful call. West, who hadn’t slept “in about a week,” according to a source — was at the L.A.-area home of his trainer Harley Pasternak acting paranoid and psychotic. “He was having difficulty identifying what was real,” explains the source. 
 
 Despite the recent rocky patch, Kim sprang into action, setting up camp in West’s private hospital room at UCLA Medical Center. And though the incident was scary for the reality star, a source close to the couple says she thinks it will heal their relationship. “Kanye’s behavior took a huge toll on their marriage,” says the source. “But Kim feels relieved he is getting the help he needs. She thinks this is what it will take to save him — and help their marriage.”

SAN ANTONIO -- In a viral Facebook post, a woman claims a man became angry at her teenage son and his friends because one of them was wearing what appears to be a "Make America Great Again" slogan hat. 
 
 The San Antonio Police Department announced late Thursday that 30-year-old Kino Jimenez has been arrested and charged with theft. SAPD says that Jimenez was arrested at his home in Universal City without incident. 
 
 The altercation reportedly happened at a Whataburger location near Thousand Oaks and Nacogdoches Road, according to the post. 
 
 In her post Wednesday, Patricia Spittler asks Facebook users to help identify the "scum bag of the year." 
 
 The man in the video is shown throwing his drink at the table and shouting a racial slur. 
 
 Her video was since removed or changed to a private setting. However, the video has also been posted on other social media accounts. 
 
 WARNING: The video contains graphic language.

 "His friend was wearing a patriotic hat, and this happened! It would be nice to know who he is for someone to let him know his actions are not okay! Real tough guy... approaches a group of teenagers minding their own business just having a burger! He kept his hat, too," she wrote in the original post. 
 
 Whataburger released the following statement Thursday morning: 
 
 “We were shocked to see this video and certainly don’t condone this type of customer behavior in our restaurants. To be clear, no Whataburger employees were involved or witnessed the incident, and we ask that questions be directed to San Antonio PD as we continue supporting their efforts.” 
 
 The man in the video has reportedly been fired from his job and the San Antonio Police Department is investigating the incident. 
 
 Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign manager commented on the incident Thursday afternoon on Twitter: 
 
 I would love to send this teenager a signed @realDonaldTrump hat and stand with him in #SanAntonio. There are hundreds of thousands that will stand with you there.

South Africa's president asked the world to pray for his predecessor, Nelson Mandela, and to keep him in their thoughts. NBC's Rohit Kachroo reports. 
 
 Former South African President Nelson Mandela is "responding positively" to treatment for a recurring lung infection after he was taken to a hospital late Wednesday, the presidency said on Thursday. 
 
 "The doctors advise that former President Nelson Mandela is responding positively to the treatment he is undergoing for a recurring lung infection," the presidency said in a statement. "He remains under treatment and observation in hospital." 
 
 In a statement, the current South African President Jacob Zuma said, “We appeal to the people of South Africa and the world to pray for our beloved Madiba [a nickname for Mandela] and his family and to keep them in their thoughts.” 
 
 “We have full confidence in the medical team and know that they will do everything possible to ensure recovery,” he added. “The Presidency appeals once again for understanding and privacy in order to allow space to the doctors to do their work.” 
 
 Mandela, 94, was taken to a hospital just before midnight local time (6 p.m. ET). 
 
 The statement said that Mandela had the “best possible expert in medical treatment and comfort.” 
 
 Mandela has a history of lung problems dating back to when he contracted tuberculosis as a political prisoner in the notorious Robben Island jail under the apartheid regime.

 'Be strong' 
 
 Jackson Mthembu, a spokesman for the African National Congress, said in a statement that the party once led by Mandela “calls on all South Africans and the world to keep Nelson Mandela in their prayers.” 
 
 “We are confident that the treatment will be successful as he is in professional and competent hands,” he said. 
 
 “During these trying times we wish President Mandela well and for his family to be strong," he added. 
 
 Mandela spent nearly three weeks in a hospital in December for treatment of a lung infection and gallstone surgery. 
 
 This was the longest time he had been hospitalized since being released from captivity as a political prisoner in 1990. 
 
 He was also hospitalized earlier this month for what was described as a "scheduled medical checkup." 
 
 Mandela was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999, the first president of the country to be elected following the fall of the apartheid system. 
 
 President Barack Obama sent his best wishes to the former leader on Thursday. 
 
 "He is as strong physically as he's been in character and in leadership over so many decades, and hopefully he will ... come out of this latest challenge," Obama told reporters at the White House. 
 
 "When you think of a single individual that embodies the kind of leadership qualities that I think we all aspire to, the first name that comes up is Nelson Mandela. And so we wish him all the very best," Obama said. 
 
 NBC News' Matthew DeLuca and Rohit Kachroo, and Reuters contributed to this report.

 Former South African President Nelson Mandela is "responding positively" to treatment after he was readmitted to a hospital overnight for a recurring lung infection. 
 
 President Jacob Zuma's office passed along the doctors' assessment of Mandela, the 94-year-old anti-apartheid icon and nation's first black president. 
 
 "He remains under treatment and observation in hospital," Zuma said Thursday. 
 
 Mandela was conscious when he was taken to the hospital just before midnight Wednesday, Zuma's office said. 
 
 It's the second time this month he has been hospitalized. More than two weeks ago, he was taken to a hospital for what officials described as a routine checkup. 
 
 Mandela has become increasingly frail over the years, and has not appeared in public since South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010.

A sheriff in Missouri said a tourist boat has apparently capsized on the lake, leaving... (Associated Press) 
 
 BRANSON, Mo. (AP) — At least 13 people, including children, died after a boat carrying tourists capsized and sank on a lake during a thunderstorm in a country music mecca in southwest Missouri, authorities said Friday. 
 
 Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Jason Pace said four people remain missing Friday after the Ride the Ducks boat sank on Table Rock Lake in Branson Thursday evening. He said 14 people survived, and that seven of them were injured. 
 
 Patrol divers found two more bodies early Friday, raising the death toll from 11 to 13, Pace said. 
 
 A spokeswoman for the Cox Medical Center Branson said four adults and three children arrived at the hospital shortly after the incident. Two adults are in critical condition and the others were treated for minor injuries, Brandei Clifton said. 
 
 Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader said Thursday that stormy weather likely made the boat capsize. Another duck boat on the lake made it safely back to shore. 
 
 Steve Lindenberg, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Springfield, Missouri, said the agency issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the Branson area Thursday evening. Lindenberg said winds reached speeds of more than 60 mph (100 kph). 
 
 "It's a warning telling people to take shelter," he said. 
 
 Rader said an off-duty sheriff's deputy working security for the boat company helped rescue people after the boat capsized. Dive teams from several law enforcement agencies assisted in the effort. 
 
 The National Transportation Safety Board said investigators will arrive on the scene Friday morning. 
 
 Suzanne Smagala with Ripley Entertainment, which owns Ride the Ducks in Branson, said the company was assisting authorities with the rescue effort. Smagala added this was the Branson tour's only accident in more than 40 years of operation. 
 
 Branson is about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Kansas City and is a popular vacation spot for families and other tourists looking for entertainment ranging from theme parks to live music. An EF2 tornado that bounced through downtown Branson in 2012 destroyed dozens of buildings and injured about three dozen people, but killed no one. 
 
 Duck boats, which can travel on land and in water, have been involved in other deadly incidents in the past. Five college students were killed in 2015 in Seattle when a duck boat collided with a bus, and 13 people died in 1999 when a duck boat sank near Hot Springs, Arkansas. 
 
 Safety advocates have sought improvements since the Arkansas deaths. Critics argued that part of the problem is that too many agencies regulate the boats with varying safety requirements. 
 
 Duck boats were originally used by the U.S. military in World War II to transport troops and supplies, and later were modified for use as sightseeing vehicles. ||||| Emergency responders work at Table Rock Lake after a deadly boat accident in Branson, Mo., Thursday, July 19, 2018.

 Port St. Lucie police officers nabbed the 12-foot, 120-pound Burmese python Friday after responding to reports of an extremely large snake on a block with homes. Police said the python killed one neighborhood cat and may be responsible for the recent disappearance of several others.

The primary goal of President Obama’s presser, which just wrapped up, was obvious: He was clearly out to pick a major public fight with Republicans over tax cuts for the rich. Obama mounted a surprisingly aggressive moral case for ending high end tax cuts, casting it as a test of our society’s priorities, and argued — crucially — that anyone who fails to support ending them is fundamentally unserious about the deficit. 
 
 He also went out of his way to highlight GOP opposition to raising revenues by ending a perk for corporate jet owners. This proposal would raise only $3 billion, which means it’s trivial in the larger scheme of things, and Obama’s mention of it seemed deliberately designed to provoke howls of outrage and cries of “class warfare” from Republicans — with the obvious goal of maneuvering Republicans into the role of arch defenders of the interests of the wealthy. 
 
 Obama is picking this fight in order to reframe the deficit and debt ceiling debate as a battle not over government spending — losing turf for Dems — but over who has the most balanced priorities and who is really working in the interests of the whole country. 
 
 Here’s the key quote, which mentions the corporate jet tax break no less than three times: 
 
 If we choose to keep those tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, if we keep the tax break for corporate jet owners, if we choose to keep tax breaks for oil and gas companies that are making hundreds of billions of dollars, then that means we’ve got to cut some kids off from getting a college scholarship. That means we have to stop funding certain grants for medical research. That means that food safety may be compromised. That means that Medicare has to bear a greater part of the burden. These are the choices we have to make... 
 
 The Republicans say they want to reduce the deficit. Every single observer who’s not an elected official or politican says we can’t reduce our deficit in the scale and scope we need to without having a balanced approach that looks at everything. Democrats have to accept some painful spending cuts that hurt some of our consituencies that we may not like. And we’ve shown a willingness to do that for the greater good... 
 
 If you are a wealthy CEO or hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they’ve ver been. They’re lower than they’ve been since the 1950s. And you can afford it. You’ll still be able to ride on your corporate jet. You’ll just have to pay a little more...My believe is that the Republican leadership in Congress will hopefully sooner rather than later come to the conclusion that they need to make the right decisions for the country, that everybody else has been willing to move off their maximalist position. They need to do the same. My expectation is that they’ll do the responsible thing. 
 
 In another key moment, Obama seemed to draw a line against cost-shifting to seniors to solve the Medicare problem. He said: 
 
 We’re gonna have to look at entitlements. And that’s always difficult politically. But I’ve been willing to say we need to see where we can reduce the cost of health care spending and Medicare and Medicaid in the out years. Not by shifting costs on to seniors, as some have proposed, but rather by actually reducing those costs. 
 
 While there’s good reason for skepticism that the final deal won’t contain some kind of cost shifting, it was good to hear Obama lay down that marker in those terms. 
 
 More broadly, Obama stopped just short of saying he would not accept a final deficit deal without a high end tax hike. But his presser made it clear that he will will relitigate this fight and make it central to the campaign. And while we should keep in mind that Obama did ultimately cut a deal on the high-end tax cuts last time around, those who are hoping he will continue to make a strong moral argument in favor of ending them should be pleased by what they heard. ||||| As I wrote yesterday, Democrats are obsessed with repealing the Bush tax cuts, especially the upper-end. They could use a 12-Step program and a Higher Power. 
 
 President Obama, after signing an extension of the Bush tax cuts last December, relapsed once again at his news conference today. It was the usual bashing of millionaires and billionaires, oil companies, corporate jets (made by Cessna and Hawker-Beechcraft), and investment funds. 
 
 Plus, the president says there’s only about $1 trillion of spending cuts over ten years. Pardon me for being cynical for thinking much of that is phony baloney. 
 
 So the whole debt-ceiling business is going nowhere. Republicans correctly reject tax hikes and the president isn’t yet digging in on spending. There’s no majority in the House for a $600 billion tax hike,

 So...how’s the hangover? 
 
 That’s the question on the world’s lips after news of Middlesbrough lads Phillip Boyle and Jamie Blyth’s last-minute trip to Thailand made headlines across the globe. 
 
 But - perhaps surprisingly - the pair are feeling pretty dapper. 
 
 “I’m feeling okay now,” says Phillip, speaking to The Gazette after their booze-fuelled jaunt to Thailand. 
 
 “I was worse when we came!” 
 
 Jamie and Phillip with his upgraded bag 
 
 “It’s been crazy,” says 33-year-old company director Phillip from Nunthorpe. 
 
 The Gazette first broke news of the story on Monday after learning that the pair - who started their Friday night at The Southern Cross in Marton for a ‘quiet pint’ - had ended up jetting out to Thailand in a drunken haze. 
 
 But the boozy plan paid off and - despite a few moments of hesitation as the drink wore off - they’ve had the time of their lives. 
 
 “It was around the bend there,” says Phillip of the holiday resort of Pattaya. 
 
 “It’s been non-stop as we were only there for a couple of days. 
 
 “We went out for meals and to bars and didn’t really sleep that much. 
 
 “If we were there for a week or so we might have travelled around a bit. 
 
 “I have fallen behind with a few things at work though,” admits Phillip. 
 
 Phillip had initially jetted out with just a carrier bag stuffed with a few T-Shirts and pairs of boxer shorts. 
 
 But he did manage to upgrade - buying a new backpack and a pair of trainers whilst out there, that were unfortunately swiped. 
 
 Phillip forced to wear work shoes after trainers were pinched 
 
 Pal Jamie, 33, a rigger from Marton and instigator of the trip, said: “On the way out there we sobered up on the flight and thought ‘what have we done!’ 
 
 “We were a bit confused in Abu Dhabi at the stop over but just thought ‘We’re here now so we should just make the most of it'. 
 
 “The guys that we knew from school were shocked to see that we’d turned up! 
 
 “It’s been great.” 
 
 Jamie, who has a new girlfriend, said: “She was a bit annoyed, but it was only two days - a short break. 
 
 “She’s just been laughing about it and thought we were daft.” 
 
 And Phillip has some advice for others wanting to follow in their footsteps. 
 
 “I would recommend it - it’s been brilliant fun.” ||||| Anyone who sat through the mess that was The Hangover Part II remembers that Bradley Cooper and his brohams woke up in Bangkok, with one shaved head, one facial tattoo and one chain-smoking capuchin monkey. Phillip Boyle and his friends managed to avoid the worst aspects of that movie, but the part about going out drinking and waking up in Thailand? Yeah, they did that. 
 
 Boyle and several friends went out on Friday night for a few drinks, picked up a few more drinks at a gas station and then stayed up all night throwing back the finest alcoholic beverages that Northern England has to offer. At 11 the next morning, Boyle’s friend Jamie Blyth started asking if he had his passport, then called a cab to take the whole hungover group to the Manchester Airport. Boyle told GazetteLive

With just hours to go before The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story debuts on Netflix, Sean Penn has come up empty in trying to get changes made to the self-described documentary series. 
 
 Despite claims by other outlets that the Oscar winner is trying to block the three-episode series by the Mexican actress, Deadline has learned that Penn’s sole aim was to see his part in the infamous October 2015 meeting with drug lord Joaqu ⁇ n Guzm ⁇ n Loera depicted accurately. An aim augmented by concerns for his safety that has met with silence from both the streaming service and producers at 25/7 Productions, we hear. 
 
 The 25/7 Production series alleges that the Oscar winner gave the Department of Justice a heads-up on the get-together with the runaway and ruthless El Chapo. 
 
 “This is nothing but a cheap, National Enquirer-esque tale spun be a delusional person whose hunger for fame is both tawdry and transparent,” a spokesperson for Penn told Deadline today of the series that premieres early Friday on Netflix. 
 
 Penn later wrote about the meeting in a much criticized and widely read Rolling Stone article that came out just after the hiding Guzman was captured by Mexican authorities in early 2016. At the time, anonymous Mexican law enforcement officials claimed that Penn and del Castillo’s meeting with Guzm ⁇ n led them to the drug lord. Claims that Penn disputed and have since faded. 
 
 “It is reprehensible that, in their ongoing, relentless efforts to gain additional attention and publicity, Ms. del Castillo and her team (who have zero firsthand knowledge) have sought to create this profoundly false, foolish, and reckless narrative,” a spokesperson for Penn added Thursday of the El Chapo series that Netflix is distributing. “The notion that Mr. Penn or anyone on his behalf alerted DOJ to the trip is a complete fabrication and bald-faced lie,” the statement adds. “It never happened, nor would there have been any reason for it to have happened.” 
 
 Neither Netflix nor the El Chapo producers responded to request for comment on Penn’s concerns. “Sean Penn was not trying to kill this or stop this, he just wanted to see it and then thought it need a re-edit,” a source tells Deadline of the actor’s original desire when he was made aware of the project. 
 
 In fact, a move by Penn’s CAA agent Bryan Lourd to get the actor a viewing of the finished product also hit a wall initially. When Penn did finally see the El Chapo series just over a month ago, he asked for it to be edited to more closely reflect what he said was the truth. Lawyers for Penn also informed Netflix in correspondence that the Mystic River star was worried associates of El Chapo would potentially seek revenge against the actor. 
 
 As can been seen from the trailer below, the El Chapo series mainly focuses on del Castillo, who’s political thriller Ingobernable series was renewed in April for a second season with Netflix. 
 
 Having escaped from a Mexican prison in July 2015, the recaptured Guzman was extradited to the U.S. by our southern neighbor’s government in January to face American justice over criminal activity from his role as the head of the Sinaloa cartel. ||||| Disclosure: Some names have had to be changed, locations not named, and an understanding was brokered with the subject that this piece would be submitted for the subject’s approval before publication.

 ESPN has admitted that commentator Rob Parker crossed the line when he questioned whether Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III is not really black because he has a white fiancee. But Parker doesn’t seem to think he did anything wrong. 
 
 After making those comments on Thursday morning, Parker was inundated with criticism on Twitter, and in his responses on Thursday afternoon, he generally acted as though he was the one who was owed an apology for anyone daring to question what he’d said. Parker called his critics, among other things, “uneducated” and “silly.” 
 
 But Parker suddenly stopped tweeting on Thursday, presumably because his bosses at ESPN told him to knock it off. After all, if the critics who were going after Parker on Twitter are uneducated and silly, doesn’t that mean the bosses at ESPN who said Parker’s comments were inappropriate are also uneducated and silly? 
 
 Before he went silent on Twitter, Parker also told critics to tune in to Friday’s First Take for more discussion of the matter. That’s right out of the First Take playbook: The show thrives on provoking controversy. But Friday’s First Take didn’t open with Parker or with any discussion of Griffin. Instead, the show simply ignored Parker’s comments and launched into an argument between panelists Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith about Sunday’s Steelers-Cowboys game. ||||| At a time when starting quarterbacks of color are hardly a rarity in the NFL, racial issues haven’t gone away. 
 
 On Thursday, ESPN’s Rob Parker questioned Robert Griffin III’s blackness on “First Take,” prompting DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFL Players Association to tell the Post in an email: 
 
 “Robert can certainly take care of himself. Nonetheless, I hope that our men and for that matter, my own kids, will never beg for authenticity from someone who can only talk about the things that other people have the courage to do. People need to be held accountable for the offensive things that they say.” 
 
 It’s been that kind of a season, though. Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers was ripped when, suddenly, a columnist noticed that his arms are covered with tattoos. Former NFL quarterback Warren Moon suggested earlier this season that questions about the attitude of the Carolina Panthers’ Cam Newton were racially motivated. Newton disagreed, saying, “When it comes to [racism], I don’t think there is any at all. 
 
 But the topic still keeps coming up. David Whitley began a Sporting News column this way: 
 
 San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick is going to be a big-time NFL quarterback. That must make the guys in San Quentin happy. Approximately 98.7 percent of the inmates at California’s state prison have tattoos. I don’t know that as fact, but I’ve watched enough “Lockup” to know it’s close to accurate. 
 
 Kaepernick’s mom, Teresa, told USA Today that it “annoyed” her. 
 
 “You are categorizing this kid on something like tattoos? Really? Saying other guys are role models because they don’t have them? Really?” Teresa Kaepernick said. “Some of these other guys don’t have crystal-clear reputations. That’s how you’re going to define this kid? It’s pretty irritating, but it is what it is.” 
 
 It’s also generalizing in a way that really isn’t helpful and makes it seem as if the days of Doug Williams being asked about being a black quarterback really aren’t so far behind us.

Jerusalem (CNN) A Jewish teenager was arrested Thursday in connection with a series of bomb threats that have rattled Jewish institutions and community centers across the United States and other countries, Israeli police said. 
 
 A months-long international investigation led to the 19-year-old suspect, who used "advanced camouflage technologies" to cover his tracks, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. 
 
 The suspect holds dual American-Israeli citizenship, an Israeli security official told CNN. He was arrested in southern Israel after an undercover investigation with the FBI. 
 
 The threats were made against sites in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. In one case, an airline had to make an emergency landing, Rosenfeld said. 
 
 Law enforcement officials have told CNN they believed many of the threatening calls to Jewish community centers originated overseas. 
 
 Israeli police are still trying to determine the teen suspect's motive. The FBI confirmed the arrest and said in a statement it could not provide further information. 
 
 'Relieved' reaction 
 
 JCC Association of North America President and CEO Doron Krakow said he was "gratified" by the arrest but added that he was "troubled" by the suspect's background. 
 
 "We are troubled to learn that the individual suspected of making these threats against Jewish Community Centers, which play a central role in the Jewish community, as well as serve as inclusive and welcoming places for all, is reportedly Jewish," Krakow said. 
 
 Other leaders of Jewish institutions, including the Anti-Defamation League, said they were "relieved" by the arrest. 
 
 "While the details of this crime remain unclear, the impact of this individual's actions is crystal clear: These were acts of anti-Semitism," ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. "These threats targeted Jewish institutions, were calculated to sow fear and anxiety and put the entire Jewish community on high alert." 
 
 "We're very relieved that the person was caught," Rick Zakalik, executive director of the JCC of Greater Buffalo, told CNN. "It's obviously a very disturbed young man, and I pity his parents." 
 
 US Attorney General Jeff Sessions commended the FBI and Israeli National Police for their work on the case. 
 
 "Today's arrest in Israel is the culmination of a large-scale investigation spanning multiple continents for hate crimes against Jewish communities across our country," Sessions said in a statement. "The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs." 
 
 The suspect 
 
 The teenager has a history of behavioral issues and was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor when he was 14, his attorney, Galit Besh, told CNN. 
 
 The suspect's father was detained and questioned in connection to the investigation, Besh said. 
 
 Shiraz Biton, a neighbor in the southern Israel city of Ashkelon, said that she has seen the suspect and his family a lot. The suspect was "quiet" and "introverted" and seemed a "little strange," she said. 
 
 "He was always alone," Biton said. "Him and his laptop." 
 
 Rampant threats in US 
 
 In the US alone, more than 100 bomb threats have been made this year against Jewish community centers and schools. The threats were spread across 33 states and most came as part of five waves. 
 
 The incidents reached such a critical mass that President Donald Trump addressed the matter several weeks ago in his first speech to Congress 
 
 "Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries ... remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms," Trump said. 
 
 The calls were "unprecedented" for their methodical approach and sophistication, said Paul Goldenberg, who advises Jewish organizations on security as national director of the Secure Community Network. 
 
 "These masking technologies are very effective," he previously told CNN.

A conservative federal judge in Texas on Friday, Dec. 14, 2018, ruled the Affordable Care Act “invalid” on the eve of the sign-up deadline for next year. But with appeals... (Associated Press) 
 
 WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge's ruling that the Obama health law is unconstitutional has landed like a stink bomb among Republicans, who've seen the politics of health care flip as Americans increasingly value the overhaul's core parts, including protections for pre-existing medical conditions and Medicaid for more low-income people. 
 
 While the decision by the Republican-appointed judge in Texas was sweeping, it has little immediate practical impact because the Affordable Care Act remains in place while the legal battle continues, possibly to the Supreme Court. 
 
 HealthCare.gov , the government's site for signing up, was taking applications Saturday, the deadline in most states for enrolling for coverage next year, and those benefits will take effect as scheduled Jan. 1. Medicaid expansion will proceed in Virginia, one of the latest states to accept that option. Employers will still be required to cover the young adult children of workers, and Medicare recipients will still get discounted prescription drugs. 
 
 But Republicans, still stinging from their loss of the House in the midterm elections, are facing a fresh political quandary after U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor said the entire 2010 health law was invalid. 
 
 Warnings about the Texas lawsuit were part of the political narrative behind Democrats' electoral gains. Health care was the top issue for about one-fourth of voters in the November election, ahead of immigration and jobs and the economy, according to VoteCast, a nationwide survey for The Associated Press. Those most concerned with health care supported Democrats overwhelmingly. 
 
 In his ruling, O'Connor reasoned that the body of the law could not be surgically separated from its now-meaningless requirement for people to have health insurance. 
 
 "On the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we will get great, great health care for our people," President Donald Trump told reporters during a visit Saturday to Arlington National Cemetery. "We'll have to sit down with the Democrats to do it, but I'm sure they want to do it also." 
 
 Economist Gail Wilensky, who oversaw the Medicare program for President George H.W. Bush, said the state attorneys general from GOP strongholds who filed the lawsuit really weren't very considerate of their fellow Republicans. 
 
 "The fact that they could cause their fellow Republicans harm did not seem to bother them," said Wilensky, a critic of President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. 
 
 "The people who raised it are a bunch of guys who don't have serious election issues, mostly from states where saber-rattling against the ACA is fine," she added. "How many elections do you have to get battered before you find another issue?" 
 
 Douglas Holtz-Eakin, top policy adviser to Republican John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, said he was struck by the relative silence from top Republicans after the ruling issued. 
 
 A prominent example: "The House was not party to this suit, and we are reviewing the ruling and its impact," said AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. 
 
 Republicans are "going to have to figure out what to do," Holtz-Eakin said. "If it's invalidated by the courts, it's not ... 'We're going to do it our way.' They're going to have to get together with the Democrats in the House." 
 
 The GOP's failed effort last year to repeal the law showed there's no consensus within the party itself. 
 
 Trump tweeted Friday night that "Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions." 
 
 "Get it done!" he told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to be speaker in January. But Trump had no plan of his own to offer in the 2017 "repeal and replace" debate. 
 
 Two top House Republicans issued diverging statements. 
 
 Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said "Obamacare is a broken law," but added, "I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure America's healthcare system works for all Americans."

Irish parliamentarians passed a groundbreaking law early on Thursday allowing limited abortion rights in the republic. 
 
 Enda Kenny and his coalition government pushed through the protection of life in pregnancy bill, which will allow for abortions only when a woman's life is under threat if her pregnancy continues or if she is suicidal. 
 
 Despite threats of excommunication from cardinals and bishops, the privately devout Catholic prime minister eventually won the vote after a marathon two-day debate in the D ⁇ il. 
 
 Members voted by 127 to 31 to legalise abortion in cases of medical emergencies as well as the risk of suicide. 
 
 However, pro-choice and anti-abortion groups have already threatened court cases to challenge the new law. 
 
 The legislation which passed through the D ⁇ il after 24 hours of tortuous debate will not stop the annual abortion trail from Ireland to Britain. 
 
 According to Irish department of health figures released on Thursday, about 4,000 Irish women travelled to British hospitals and clinics to terminate their pregnancies last year. They included 124 who were under 18. 
 
 The new law also does not include women who were raped, meaning grim traffic across the Irish Sea for abortions will continue. 
 
 Mara Clarke, director of the London-based Abortion Support Network, a charity that raises money to help women afford the £400-£2,000 it costs to travel and pay privately for an abortion in England, condemned the restriction on an Irish woman's right to choose. She said: "Given that the Irish government has now had more than 22 years to legislate on the X case, I'm not sure what the hold up is but then I'm not an expert on Irish abortion law. 
 
 "I am an expert in what happens to women when access to abortion is restricted. Even if this law is enacted, only a very, very small percentage of women who need abortions will be able to access them in Ireland. 
 
 "Women pregnant as result of rape, women with fatal foetal anomalies, couples who simply can't afford to care for a (or in most cases, another) child, will still be left behind. 
 
 "This week alone, Abortion Support Network has heard from a woman whose abusive husband hid her passport so she couldn't travel for an abortion, a woman who considered crashing her car to induce a miscarriage, and a couple whose very wanted pregnancy had catastrophic foetal anomalies – and these were only three of the 10 women who contacted us last week." 
 
 Sinn Féin TD (MP) Caoimhgh ⁇ n  ⁇  Caol ⁇ in predicted that it was only a matter of time before a case emerged through the courts challenging that aspect of the new bill that criminalises abortion. 
 
 Anyone procuring or seeking an abortion could face up to 14 years in prison. He said a case might result from a young woman taking abortion pills who might seek to challenge the penalty. 
 
 Independent leftwing TD Catherine Murphy said the criminalisation of women seeking abortions could open up Ireland to fresh challenges in the European court of human rights. 
 
 Terminations For Medical Reasons – the campaign group for women who seek abortions because their babies will die if their pregnancies continue – accused the government of lacking courage to include their cases in the legislation. 
 
 "We are enormously saddened that their decision means that it could now be years before this is changed in legislation. With each week that passes, more grieving women and couples will have to leave Ireland to receive medical care," a TMFR spokesperson said. 
 
 During the debate, the Europe minister Lucinda Creighton was expelled from the Fine Gael parliamentary party. Creighton voted against the abortion law reform and is now expected to lose her ministerial job as well. On her way out of the D ⁇ il, Creighton shook Kenny's hand saying: "I'm very sad, but I genuinely wish Enda Kenny and all the government the very best." 
 
 After leaving, she reminded Fine Gael that they had made an electoral promise in 2011 not to introduce abortion into Ireland. ||||| Lawmakers overwhelmingly voted Friday to back Ireland's first bill on abortion, legalizing the practice in exceptional cases where doctors deem the woman's life at risk from her pregnancy, as the predominantly Catholic country took its first legislative step away from an outright ban.

 From the balcony of the U.S. Capitol, Pope Francis asked a crowd of tens of thousands to pray for him. 
 
 It's a plea he traditionally makes. But this time, speaking in Spanish, he added a line to acknowledge that not everyone in the crowd was Christian, much less a believer. 
 
 Through a translator, the pontiff said: "If among you there are some who don't believe or who cannot pray, I ask that you send good wishes my way." 
 
 After his speech to Congress, the pope walked onto a balcony of the Capitol and greeted the throngs with "Buenos Dias." 
 
 He expressed gratitude for their presence and asked God to bless "the most important ones here — children." 
 
 Francis ended his remarks in English, saying "Thank you very much and God bless America." The crowd cheered boisterously.

 Pope Francis has taken his call for action on climate change to Congress. In his address to lawmakers, Francis urged a "courageous and responsible effort" to avert the most serious effects of what he called the "environmental deterioration caused by human activity." 
 
 Francis says he's convinced that working together, nations can make a difference to slow global warming. He says the U.S. and "this Congress" have an important role to play. Now, he says, is the time for a "culture of care."

 Pope Francis is lamenting that the very basis of marriage and family life today is being put into question — an allusion to gay marriage in a country that recently legalized same-sex marriage across the land. 
 
 Speaking before Congress in the first-ever papal address, Francis said the family today is "threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without." 
 
 While Francis has shown great openness to gays as individuals, he has staunchly upheld the church teaching that marriage is a union between man and woman. 
 
 Sitting in front of Francis for his speech was John Roberts, chief justice of the Supreme Court, which legalized gay marriage across the country. 
 
 Francis is expected to speak in greater depth about the threats to families at a big church rally in Philadelphia later this week.

 Pope Francis is demanding an end to the arms trade, delivering a tough message to a country that is the world's largest exporter of weapons.

 Francis has in the past denounced weapons makers and dealers as "the root of evil" and questioned how weapons manufacturers can call themselves Christian. 
 
 Francis has, however, said that it is legitimate to use military force against an "unjust aggression," such as the attacks by Islamic extremists against Christian and other religious minorities in Syria and Iraq.

 Following a Mediterranean diet might be a recipe for a long life because it appears to keep people genetically younger, say US researchers. 
 
 Its mix of vegetables, olive oil, fresh fish and fruits may stop our DNA code from scrambling as we age, according to a study in the British Medical Journal. 
 
 Nurses who adhered to the diet had fewer signs of ageing in their cells. 
 
 The researchers from Boston followed the health of nearly 5,000 nurses over more than a decade. 
 
 The Mediterranean diet has been repeatedly linked to health gains, such as cutting the risk of heart disease. 
 
 These results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing heart disease Dr Mike Knapton of the British Heart Foundation 
 
 Although it's not clear exactly what makes it so good, its key components - an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables as well as poultry and fish, rather than lots of red meat, butter and animal fats - all have well documented beneficial effects on the body. 
 
 Foods rich in vitamins appear to provide a buffer against stress and damage of tissues and cells. And it appears from this latest study that a Mediterranean diet helps protect our DNA. 
 
 Telomeres 
 
 The researchers looked at tiny structures called telomeres that safeguard the ends of our chromosomes, which store our DNA code. 
 
 These protective caps prevent the loss of genetic information during cell division. 
 
 Image copyright SPL Image caption Telomeres cap the end of our chromosomes 
 
 As we age and our cells divide, our telomeres get shorter - their structural integrity weakens, which can tell cells to stop dividing and die. 
 
 Experts believe telomere length offers a window on cellular ageing. 
 
 Shorter telomeres have been linked with a broad range of age-related diseases, including heart disease, and a variety of cancers. 
 
 In the study, nurses who largely stuck to eating a Mediterranean diet had longer, healthier telomeres. 
 
 No individual dietary component shone out as best, which the researchers say highlights the importance of having a well-rounded diet. 
 
 Independent experts said the findings were interesting but by no means conclusive. 
 
 Dr David Llewellyn, senior research fellow in clinical epidemiology at the University of Exeter, said: "All observational studies have the potential to produce misleading estimates, and we should not assume that the association with telomere length is necessarily causal. 
 
 "That said, this large well-conducted study is consistent with the hypothesis that dietary interventions may lead to substantial improvements in health." 
 
 The British Heart Foundation said: "These results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing heart disease." ||||| Conclusion In this large study, greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with longer telomeres. These results further support the benefits of adherence to the Mediterranean diet for promoting health and longevity. 
 
 Results Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with longer telomeres after adjustment for potential confounders. Least squares mean telomere length z scores were  ⁇ 0.038 (SE 0.035) for the lowest Mediterranean diet score groups and 0.072 (0.030) for the highest group (P for trend=0.004). 
 
 Given that fruits, vegetables, and nuts, key components of the Mediterranean diet, have well known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and that telomere length is affected by both of these processes, we hypothesized that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet would be associated with longer telomere length. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to examine the association between greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and leukocyte telomere length in US women within the Nurses’ Health Study cohort. For comparison, we also evaluated the association between other existing dietary patters (prudent pattern, Western pattern, and Alternative Healthy Eating Index) and leukocyte telomere length. 
 
 Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that undergo attrition each time a somatic cell divides. 7 Telomeres prevent the loss of genomic DNA at the ends of linear chromosomes and in turn protect their physical integrity. 8 9 Telomere attrition has been shown to be accelerated by oxidative stress and inflammation. 10 11 Telomere length is considered to be a biomarker of aging; shorter telomeres are associated with a decreased life expectancy and increased rates of developing age related chronic diseases. 12 13 14 Telomere length decreases with age and varies considerably among individuals. 15 Studies suggest that telomere attrition is modifiable, as substantial variability exists in the rate of telomere shortening that is independent of chronological age. 16 17 18 Therefore, variability of telomere length may be partially explained by lifestyle practices, including dietary patterns. 19 As accelerated telomere attrition may underlie many chronic diseases, identifying modifiable factors that affect telomere dynamics is important.

 "No one can say how long she will live," Morena Herrera of the Feminist Collective for Local Development told The Associated Press. "It was painful to see the little creature. That's what the grandmother told us, and the doctors confirmed it." 
 
 The country's Supreme Court last week prohibited an abortion for Beatriz, who suffers from lupus and kidney failure and whose lawyers said the pregnancy was threatening her life. Her plight drew international attention and a ruling from the Inter-American Court on Human Rights that El Salvador should protect her life and help her end the pregnancy. 
 
 The Health Ministry stepped in late last week after the ruling and said it would allow the C-section because the pregnancy was already at 26 weeks and the country's strict abortion laws were no longer at play. Ultrasound images had indicated her fetus was developing with only a brain stem. 
 
 The Health Ministry can determine what is most medically sound for a mother versus the unborn baby and was lauded internationally for working to save the woman's life. 
 
 Doctors at the Maternity Hospital had been preparing to perform the C-section at the slightest danger signs to save Beatriz's life, said Maria Isabel Rodriguez of the health ministry. 
 
 The woman was recovering under the close watch of doctors late Monday. 
 
 El Salvador's laws prohibit all abortions, even when a woman's health is at risk. Beatriz and any doctor who terminated her pregnancy would have faced arrest and criminal charges. 
 
 A majority of judges on the high court rejected the appeal by Beatriz's lawyers, saying physical and psychological exams by the government-run Institute of Legal Medicine found that her diseases were under control and that she could continue the pregnancy. 
 
 Just as the Health Ministry was resolving the case, the Inter-American Court issued its ruling, but it no longer applied in the case. 
 
 Abortion opponents said the case was being used to press for legalized abortion in El Salvador, which has some of the toughest abortion laws in Latin America, along with Chile, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua and Suriname. ||||| SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - The pregnant woman at the centre of an abortion controversy in El Salvador had her malformed foetus delivered on Monday by Caesarean section to save her life and avoid breaking the law, although the baby did not survive. 
 
 El Salvador's Health Ministry said doctors attending the woman, who uses the name "Beatriz" to protect her identity, performed a Caesarean to remove the foetus, thereby avoiding an abortion, which is illegal in the country. 
 
 The Central American country banned all types of abortion in 1999, but Beatriz's foetus had a serious condition known as anencephaly, which results in only partial brain development. Such a foetus has little or no chance of surviving after birth. 
 
 Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez said the operation took place about 2 p.m. (2000 GMT) and that Beatriz, who had been 27 weeks pregnant, was in stable condition. 
 
 "She's in good hands, being looked after well," she told Reuters. "I expect things to go well over the next few hours." 
 
 Shortly afterward, Rodriguez said that Beatriz's baby daughter died about five hours after the operation. 
 
 Beatriz, 22, suffers from lupus and kidney problems, which posed a serious threat to her own health. 
 
 The operation followed a non-binding resolution on Thursday by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that called on El Salvador to take action to save Beatriz's life after the country's courts had denied her an abortion. 
 
 El Salvador's Supreme Court rejected Beatriz's request for an abortion on the grounds it breached the constitution, which it said protects life from the moment of conception. 
 
 The Caesarean delivery provided El Salvador with a way out of the legal wrangle. 
 
 Morena Herrera, a spokeswoman for the abortion rights group Colectivo Feminista, said that although Beatriz could have been spared unnecessary suffering, her life had been saved. 
 
 Claudia Handal, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion group Red Familia, said the rights of all had been respected. 
 
 "We're very happy because as we said from the beginning, it wasn't necessary to perform an abortion, the point was to respect the baby's life and to give Beatriz the

Tens of thousands march to the presidential palace in Cairo, undeterred by riot police and tear gas. 
 
 CAIRO — Anger between Egypt’s rival political camps erupted into street battles Wednesday after Islamist supporters of President Mohamed Morsi tore down tents of anti-government demonstrators, raising the possibility of widening violence over the nation’s proposed constitution. 
 
 Pro-Morsi factions overran about 200 protesters camped outside the presidential palace in north Cairo. The clashes came after the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party called thousands of its members into the streets in a counter-demonstration to drive opposition movements from the presidential palace. 
 
 Shoving and punching spilled down a boulevard as hurled stones, swinging sticks and firebombs filled the dusk in one of the capital’s wealthiest neighborhoods. Pro-Morsi contingents, including Brotherhood followers and ultraconservative Salafis, chased opposition activists shouting: “God is great. The people support the president’s decision.” 
 
 More than 125 people were injured on a cityscape that had the charged air of a flourescent-lit battlefield with competing banners, bandaged men and dinner trays used as shields to block barrages of rocks. 
 
 Police were slow to react but eventually arrived and attempted to separate the two sides even as the skirmishes raised fears that animosity between Islamists and the mainly secular opposition were a dangerous foreshadowing. Both camps threatened to march against each other and there appeared little compromise in a battle over the nation’s future that symbolizes the larger struggle over political Islam rising from the Arab Spring. 
 
 “Vicious attack vs. peaceful protesters in front of presidential palace,” tweeted Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and opposition leader. “Regime leading Egypt into violence and bloodshed.” 
 
 The clashes revealed new cracks in Morsi’s government from officials disturbed by the power and meddling of the Brotherhood. Three presidential advisors resigned, including Seif Abdel-Fattah, who told the Egyptian media: “Egypt is bigger than a narrow-minded elite .... We can no longer stay silent because they [the Brotherhood] have harmed the nation and the revolution.” 
 
 Tensions began two weeks ago when Morsi, a former Brotherhood leader, issued a decree that expanded his powers and protected the Islamist-dominated constitutional assembly from judicial oversight. The country’s highest court was expected to dissolve the assembly but delegates quickly finished a draft constitution that Morsi ordered be put to a national referendum Dec. 15. 
 
 Opposition factions marched on the presidential palace Tuesday to protest Morsi’s authority and the charter, which they say would open the country to Islamic law and a scaling back of civil rights. The demonstration angered the Brotherhood, which on Saturday avoided confrontation with the opposition by holding a massive rally miles away from Tahrir Square, where anti-Morsi movements have made their base. 
 
 But the Brotherhood on Wednesday was more aggressive: “The president will not retreat, and if the state apparatus is weakened by the wounds of the previous period, then the people can impose their will and protect legitimacy,” said Essam Erian, deputy head of the Freedom and Justice Party.

 Special correspondent Gaser El Safty contributed to this report. ||||| CAIRO—Tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of Egypt's president clashed Wednesday, hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails and brawling in Cairo's streets, in the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the country's revolution early last year. 
 
 The confrontation started in the evening after Islamist protesters marching in support of President Mohammed Morsi, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, moved to break up a demonstration by the president's non-Islamist opponents outside the presidential palace in Cairo, where Mr. Morsi has his offices. 
 
 Supporters of the rival camps, spurred by public defiance by influential figures on each side, waged back-and-forth battles in side streets outside the palace walls as night fell, shutting down major thoroughfares. Around midnight, police formed a barrier between the camps, with thousands of demonstrators on each side, as gunshots rang out and each side accused the other of firing live rounds. 
 
 Those allegations couldn't be confirmed. More than 120 people were wounded, Egyptian medics said late Wednesday. The Muslim Brotherhood said at least one of its supporters had been killed, while opposition officials said two of their supporters had died. A local television channel, ONTV, showed images of two people it said were killed in the clashes, and said violence was spreading elsewhere in Cairo. 
 
 The Obama administration exhorted the sides to respect each other and refrain from bloodshed. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking in Brussels, called for a two-way dialogue. She also expressed

Scientists have learned that upwards of 25 percent of all people who become infected with Ebola show none of the typical symptoms. The finding suggests the recent West African Ebola Epidemic was more widespread than previously thought, and that new methods need to be developed to diagnose and contain the dreaded virus during an outbreak. 
 
 
 
 Typically, Ebola produces a panoply of symptoms, including fever, unexplained bleeding, headache, muscle pain, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing problems, and difficulty swallowing. As is well documented, this virus is particularly deadly, killing between 10 to 80 percent of people who exhibit these symptoms (the statistical spread reflects the divide between those who have access to intensive care and those who don’t). 
 
 But as a new study published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases shows, a significant portion of people who contract Ebola don’t show any of the typical signs, meaning they’re asymptomatic, or their symptoms are relatively mild and not wholly reflective of how the virus affects most people. In other words, they have “minimally symptomatic infections.” 
 
 Prior to the new study, scientists suspected that Ebola, like many other viruses, might not always manifest in the same predictable way. The new study, led by Gene Richardson, a PhD candidate in anthropology at Stanford University and a former fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, now confirms this suspicion, while providing an actual estimate for the rate of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic infections in Ebola patients. 
 
 Following the recent West African Ebola Epidemic, Richardson and his colleagues went back to the rural village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone, a major hotspot for the outbreak. The village, which is home to 900 residents, recorded 34 cases of Ebola during the epidemic, including 28 deaths. Working with a local physician, Richardson’s team tested 187 men, women, and children from Sukudu who had likely been exposed to Ebola, either because they lived in the same household or shared a public toilet with a person known to have had the disease.

 Of these, 14 were found to carry an antibody to Ebola—a sure sign that they were infected at some point. A dozen of these villagers said they had no symptoms of the disease, while two recalled having a fever at the time of the outbreak. 
 
 It’s now certainly possible that some of these villagers had full-blown symptoms but were fearful of admitting the truth to doctors. Consequently, more research with a larger sample pool will have to be performed. However, Richardson and his colleagues think they’re onto something, and that the villagers were probably telling the truth. 
 
 Importantly, the researchers aren’t sure if an asymptomatic person with Ebola can transmit the virus. “They were not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhea,” noted Richardson in a statement. “It’s unclear if they can pass it along it sexually.”

 More research is needed to determine if Ebola can be spread by a person who shows no or very few symptoms, but it’s a very distinct possibility. A person with an infection still has Ebola particles in their body, which could find a way to “jump” to another person. But without the typical symptoms, it’s certainly much more difficult. As Richardson noted, the virus might be transmitted sexually, though that still needs to be proven in an asymptomatic individual. 
 
 Richardson and his colleagues are now working in other villages in Sierra Leone to get a better handle on the true number of people affected during the crisis. But if the figure of 25 percent is correct—and if Ebola can spread via asymptomatic people (that’s still a big if)—that presents a massive headache for health officials.

 Adding insult to injury, the Ebola virus mutated into a deadlier form during the last outbreak, showing an ability to quickly adapt to human biology and become even more virulent. Taken together, these new findings show that Ebola spreads more rapidly and more broadly through a population, highlighting the need for new detection and containment techniques for when the next outbreak hits. 
 
 
 
 [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases] ||||| By using ELISA to measure Zaire Ebola virus antibody concentrations, we identified a significant number of individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection in a ‘hotspot’ village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak. The findings provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. These data also suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the outbreak. Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clinical sequelae in individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection. 
 
 We conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey in Sukudu, Kono District, Sierra Leone, from October 2015 to January 2016. A blood sample was collected from 187 study participants,

The House and Senate adjourned for the year on Wednesday evening, closing a two-year term that holds the odd distinction of being both historically busy and epically unpopular. 
 
 A Congress that was dominated by Democrats passed more landmark legislation than any since the era of Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society." 
 
 Congress approved an $814 billion economic stimulus, a massive health-care overhaul, and new regulations on Wall Street trading and consumer credit cards. The list grew longer during this month's frenetic lame-duck session: tax cuts, a nuclear arms treaty and a repeal of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy on gays in the military. 
 
 But the 111th Congress will also be remembered for endless filibuster threats, volcanic town hall meetings, and the rise of the tea party. All were symbols of a dissatisfaction that peaked on Nov. 2, with a Republican rout in the midterm elections. 
 
 "This is the most dysfunctional political environment that I have ever seen. But then you have to juxtapose that with [this Congress being] one of, at least, the three most productive Congresses" since 1900, said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. 
 
 "Making sense of all of that can make your head burst," he added. 
 
 The key to understanding this period, scholars say, is that the two parties were using radically different strategies. 
 
 Both thought they were playing the "long game" - the Republicans, by propelling themselves back into power; the Democrats, by writing their agenda into law. 
 
 On Wednesday, President Obama added another piece of that agenda into law, signing the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell." A few blocks away, Congress was using its last hours to approve two others: the New START nuclear arms pact with Russia, and a bill to extend health benefits to workers who responded to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 
 
 The day had the feel of a victory lap, with Democrats rejuvenated only a few weeks after a historic electoral beating. 
 
 "This has been a season of progress for the American people," Obama said in a news conference. "This has been the most productive post-election period we've had in decades, and it comes on the heels of the most productive two years that we've had in generations." 
 
 Sen. Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) was equally ebullient. "This was by far the most productive Congress in American history, and the lame-duck session we're finishing was the most productive of its kind," he said. ||||| However history judges the 535 men and women in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate the past two years, one thing is certain: The 111th Congress made more law affecting more Americans since the “Great Society” legislation of the 1960s. 
 
 For the first time since President Theodore Roosevelt began the quest for a national health-care system more than 100 years ago, the Democrat-led House and Senate took the biggest step toward achieving that goal by giving 32 million Americans access to insurance. Congress rewrote the rules for Wall Street in the most comprehensive way since the Great Depression. It spent more than $1.67 trillion to revive an economy on the verge of a depression, including tax cuts for most Americans, jobs for more than 3 million, construction of roads and bridges and investment in alternative energy; ended an almost two-decade ban against openly gay men and women serving in the military, and today ratified a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia. 
 
 Before adjournment today, Congress approved legislation to help rescuers and clean-up crews suffering from illnesses linked to the wreckage caused by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York City. The Senate approved it on a voice vote, the House by a vote of 206-60. New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, in a statement, called it a “Christmas miracle.” 
 
 For all of its ambitious achievement, the 111th Congress, which may adjourn this week, also witnessed a voter-backlash driven by a 9.6 percent unemployment rate that cost Democrats control of the House and diminished their Senate majority. 
 
 “This is probably the most productive session of Congress since at least the ‘60s,” said Alan Brinkley, a historian at New York’s Columbia University. “It’s all the more impressive given how polarized the Congress has been.” 
 
 Revenue Gains 
 
 As lawmakers wrap up the session, Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are positioned to complete their best two years in revenue, General Motors Co. has emerged from bankruptcy with more than $23 billion repaid to the U.S. Treasury, and American International Group Inc. was able to sell $2 billion of bonds in

The crowd gathered at the Conservative Political Action Conference rose to its feet as Chris Christie exited stage left. 
 
 The New Jersey governor, who has been dogged by a scandal stemming from revelations that members of his administration conspired to shut down traffic lanes leading on to the George Washington Bridge, came to CPAC on Thursday in need of a reception like that, and the party faithful delivered. 
 
 Christie’s remarks were highly anticipated, not only because of the lingering scandal but also because CPAC brass dinged him last year by leaving him off of the guest list. Today, the governor was greeted with murmurs and some quiet cheers; he drew more excitement from the audience as he proceeded. 
 
 Currently the chairman of the National Governors Association, Christie used his remarks to praise the work of his colleagues across the country. 
 
 “Republican governors in this country have stood up and done things, not just talked about them,” he said. Praise for Republican governors like Wisconsin’s Scott Walker, Ohio’s John Kasich, and Michigan’s Rick Snyder drew cheers from the crowd. 
 
 Christie returned to a familiar theme, contrasting the labor of the GOP’s governors with the fecklessness of politicians in Washington. “The most dangerous ten feet in Washington, D.C., is between anybody who wants to talk about something and a camera,” he said. 
 
 As Republicans across the country campaign against Obamacare in advance of November’s midterm elections, the governor urged them to hit some positive notes, too. The GOP, he said, is for entrepreneurship and innovation and against the “cold, hard hand of government.” The party supports a strong national defense rather than “one that allows other countries to run us over all over the world.” 
 
 Speaking to an audience that stands to his right, Christie concluded on a cautionary note, tacitly suggesting that the GOP has hurt itself by nominating candidates that are too conservative. 
 
 “We don’t get to govern if we don’t win,” he said. “Let’s come out of this conference resolved to win elections again.” ||||| 
 
 
 
 Humbled by a scandal that has hampered his rise on the national stage, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sought to reconnect with the Republican base on Thursday, delivering an uncharacteristically low-key speech to GOP activists that sounded traditional conservative themes. 
 
 “You know I’m shy and retiring, and I don’t like to speak my mind,” Christie joked during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual confab held at a convention center on the banks of the Potomac River outside Washington. 
 
 But the reference to his swaggering image seemed to invoke a figure who wasn’t there. Christie’s remarks were neither brusque nor stirring. He courted the crowd by ticking off familiar tropes, reminding skeptical conservatives of his anti-abortion bona fides and his record of taking on public-sector unions and instituting budget reforms. The Garden State governor assailed the media for bias, cast Democrats as “the party of intolerance,” and urged the GOP to define itself as the party of ideas. 
 
 “Our ideas are better than their ideas,” Christie told the packed ballroom. “We have to stop letting the media define who we are and what we stand for.” 
 
 Christie framed himself as a conservative who has secured a governing majority in a reliably blue state. If the GOP can win in New Jersey, he said, it can borrow the blueprint to expand the political map in coming elections. 
 
 “Governors are about getting things done,” Christie said, lumping himself in with a passel of conservative executives leading blue and purple states, while distancing himself from Washington lawmakers. “Republican governors in this country have stood up and done things — not just talked about them.” 
 
 Christie’s remarks, which lasted about 15 minutes, were a far cry from the all-about-me message he delivered at the 2012 Republican National Convention. His speech Thursday earned a polite reception from the crowd and was punctuated by several rounds of applause. He spoke off the cuff, using notes instead of a teleprompter. 
 
 But his very attendance is a sign that the frost between Christie and his party’s base has thawed. Christie addressed the group in 2012 but did not receive an invitation to CPAC last year. The snub came just months after his public embrace of President Barack Obama in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Many Republicans believed Christie’s effusive praise of the President in the final days of Obama’s re-election campaign helped lift the President over GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Christie spent much of 2013 focused on appealing to his state’s Democrats in order to run up the score of his re-election in preparation for a 2016 presidential campaign. 
 
 The reception may have reflected the media onslaught buffeting Christie, who has

Black pastors demand apology from Donald Trump 
 
 Instead of endorsements, many black pastors issued Donald Trump demands for an apology for his treatment of racial minorities at a closed-door meeting at Trump Tower in New York on Monday. 
 
 The demands, part of an hours-long meeting with dozens of black faith leaders that has been mired in controversy since it was announced on Wednesday, come after many leaders came under fire for meeting with Trump and after his campaign canceled the public portion of the event. But Trump, rarely one to avoid news cameras, held an impromptu press conference anyways and described the meeting as full of “love.” 
 
 Story Continued Below 
 
 “It went longer only because of the love. It didn't go longer for other reasons,” Trump said of the two-and-a-half hour session. “There were unbelievable solutions, I think, to problems that we will solve that other people won’t be able to solve.” 
 
 But there were also disagreements. During the meeting, pastors demanded Trump apologize not only to the black community, but also to Mexicans for his inflammatory rhetoric, according to Bishop Orrin Pullings, a Richmond, Virginia-based pastor. 
 
 “Our community really wants him to be sensitive with the way he handles people and they feel he’s insensitive,” said Pullings. “We told him that you are insensitive in appearance to our community and that’s not a good position. He listened to us and you know, I think Donald Trump is a very good listener.” 
 
 But others advised Trump against backing down, according to Pullings. “Another crowd said, ‘No you should never apologize. You’re ahead in the polls now because of your big mouth ... You start apologizing, you’ve got to keep apologizing.’” 
 
 Pullings said Trump remained noncommittal, which he took as a sign that the mogul will not be issuing an apology any time soon. “It’s probably out of the question.” 
 
 In Trump’s account of the meeting, pastors did not ask him to tone down his rhetoric. “The tone has taken me to first position in every single poll,” he told reporters afterward. “The beautiful thing about the meeting is they didn’t ask me to change the tone.” 
 
 The back-and-forth echoes a similar debate that emerged among evangelical leaders at a similar meeting at Trump Tower in September. At that meeting, which included evangelical leaders of all races, several attendees challenged Trump on his habit of personally attacking critics and rivals and asked him to tone down his rhetoric while others defended Trump’s bombast. The September meeting concluded with those gathered laying hands on Trump and praying over him. 
 
 Monday’s meeting was held under more contentious circumstances, and while it opened and closed with prayer, there was no laying on of hands. 
 
 Trump has come under fire in the past week for condoning the rough treatment of a Black Lives Matter protester by his white supporters at a campaign rally in Alabama and for tweeting a chart with made-up statistics overstating the percentage of white murder victims killed by blacks. 
 
 On Wednesday, Trump’s campaign initially announced the meeting with 100 black pastors and a press conference at which the pastors were to endorse the mogul. But backlash built quickly as other black faith leaders condemned Trump — including in an open letter published by Ebony Magazine. 
 
 And on Sunday, Trump’s campaign canceled the open-press portion of the event, writing instead that it expected some pastors to issue endorsements after Monday’s closed-door meeting. 
 
 Trump said Monday morning on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that he believed the Black Lives Matter movement had pressured black clergy to withhold their endorsements of him. "It gets publicity — unfortunately, as everything I do gets publicity — and probably some of the Black Lives Matter folks called them up and said: 'You shouldn't be meeting with Trump because he believes that all lives matter,'" he said. 
 
 According to Pullings, when Trump began to defend the treatment of the Black Lives Matter protester by explaining that there were 10,000 people at the rally and he did not know the race of the man, he was interrupted by Maryland-based Bishop Michael Freeman, who told him, “I have 10,00 members. If someone yells out in my crowd I don’t have them thrown out.” 
 
 Pastors also criticized Trump’s mocking impression of a New York Times reporter’s physical handicap. Though Trump and the reporter

 First baby in 12 years born on remote island where births are banned 
 
 A remote Brazilian island has welcomed its first baby in 12 years after a local woman broke the rule against giving birth there. 
 
 The baby girl born on the Atlantic outpost of Fernando de Noronha on Saturday came as a surprise to everyone – including the parents.

 “The mother, who does not want to be identified, went into labor at home,” the island’s administration said in a statement carried by O Globo newspaper. “The family says it wasn’t aware of the pregnancy.” 
 
 Tiny Fernando de Noronha – an archipelago famous for its wildlife preserve and with a population of just over 3,000 – doesn’t authorize births because there’s no maternity ward, O Globo reported. 
 
 Expectant mothers are told to travel to the mainland, where the nearest big city is Natal, 227 miles (365km) across the ocean. 
 
 The unidentified mother has another child who was born on the mainland, but told O Globo that this time she “didn’t feel anything” during her pregnancy. 
 
 “On Friday night I had pains and when I went to the bathroom I saw something coming down between my legs. That’s when the child’s father came and picked it up. It was a baby, a girl. I was dumbstruck.” ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Fernando de Noronha has one of the world's best beaches 
 
 A remote Brazilian island with a ban on childbirth is nonetheless celebrating the first baby born there in 12 years. 
 
 Fernando de Noronha island, 370km (230 miles) from the city of Natal, has about 3,000 residents but no maternity wards. 
 
 Expectant mothers are requested to travel to the mainland. 
 
 A woman who does not want to be named had a baby girl on Saturday on the island - she says she was unaware she was pregnant and is "dumbstruck". 
 
 Surprise birth 
 
 The woman is believed to be aged 22. 
 
 "On Friday night I had pains and when I went to the bathroom I saw something coming down between my legs," she was quoted as saying by O Globo website. 
 
 "That's when the child's father came and picked it up. It was a baby, a girl. I was dumbstruck." 
 
 The baby was later taken to the local hospital. 
 
 In a statement, the local administration confirmed the birth. 
 
 "The mother, who does not wish to be identified, went into labour at her home," the statement says, according to O Globo. 
 
 "The family says they were not aware of the pregnancy." 
 
 To celebrate the rare birth, local residents are now helping the family, with some donating clothes for the baby girl, reports say. 
 
 Fernando de Noronha boasts some of the world's best beaches and is famous for its wildlife reserve in Brazil's national maritime park. Sea turtles, dolphins, whales and rare birds are frequently observed there. 
 
 Because of the reserve's vulnerability, strict population controls are in place on the island. |||||

 How To Control Giant Hogweed 
 
 The information on this page is available in a more extensive PDF format. View complete Giant hogweed Control Methods (PDF, 500 KB) document. 
 
 Giant hogweed can be controlled manually, mechanically, and with herbicides. In some cases, a giant hogweed infestation is best controlled using several different methods in combination or in succession - in other words, a two, three, or even four-pronged attack plan. The final part to any control method is to plant grasses or other vegetation to provide competition for giant hogweed and decrease soil erosion. 
 
 In order for your control effort to be successful, you will have to ensure that no additional seeds are being introduced to the area. With no influx of seed and a few years of persistent control efforts, giant hogweed plants can be eradicated. 
 
 Before beginning or performing giant hogweed control, be sure to carefully read and follow the Health Hazards & Safety Instructions (this page contains graphic photos)! 
 
 Overall Giant Hogweed Control 
 
 Prevent introduction into new areas Do not move soil contaminated with seed. If removal of contaminated soil is necessary, seedling emergence can be prevented by burying the soil to a minimum depth of 20 inches (50 cm) and covering it with clean soil Sowing and planting giant hogweed is PROHIBITED Since the dispersal of giant hogweed is almost entirely by seeds, it is very important to prevent the plant from setting seed Control new, smaller infestations first before the seed bank has a chance to establish 
 
 
 
 Field technician root-cutting hogweed plants. Field technician root-cutting hogweed plants. 
 
 Manual & Mechanical Control 
 
 Methods include root cutting, flower head/seed head removal, cutting and mowing, and cut and cover. Except for root cutting, manual control will not cause immediate death of the plant. All other methods will need two to three treatments per year for several years to deplete the root reserves and kill the plants. All methods will need to occur for multiple years until no new plants grow from the seed bank. Monitor the site for at least three more years to make sure no new seedlings appear. 
 
 a. Root cutting 
 
 This method is ideal for a single plant or small infestations. We have found 400 plants to be a manageable amount for two people to control manually. 
 
 Cut the taproot approximately six inches below ground level using a spade, shovel, or anything with a large sharp edge. In areas with erosion or on steep inclines (where additional soil may be covering the plant base), plants may need to be cut up to ten inches below the soil. 
 
 
 
 If possible (for your safety), cut the plants before the leaves are very large. 
 
 The cut part of the plants should be removed from the soil and left out to dry (safest for control person) or bagged and disposed of. 
 
 If the plants do not die, cut them again when they regrow. 
 
 When using the root-cutting method, another attack strategy is to apply herbicide to the cut root remaining in the soil to help ensure no part of the root grows back the following year. 
 
 b. Hogweed flower head/seed head removal & safe disposal 
 
 Cut off the flower heads after the seeds have formed but before they mature. This will prevent the plants from shedding the seeds and from forming new flowers on lower branches. 
 
 
 
 Clear trash bags are the best for solarization (a method of using the heat from the sun to destroy the seed viability) but dark bags are suitable as well. 
 
 Seal trash bags tightly. 
 
 If sap has gotten on the outside of the bag, put it inside another trash bag so the outside is safe to handle. 
 
 Place in a secure location where they will be exposed to direct sunlight to give flowers and seeds solarization for at least two weeks. 
 
 Dispose of trash bags in the garbage. 
 
 c. Cutting & mowing 
 
 Start when plants are small and continue mowing throughout season. DO NOT mow if the plants are larger than your mower and NEVER mow if there is a flower or seed head. 
 
 If you choose to use this method, the plants must be cut at least three times during a growing season for several years. 
 
 Repeated mowing is often used for large infested areas and if done consistently and on a regular basis can destroy most of the plants. 
 
 Be careful not to spread the seeds - all flower heads should be removed and carefully disposed of prior to mowing. 
 
 Mowing equipment should be cleaned before using in another area to avoid spreading hogweed seeds.

 A Texas prison escapee on the run for almost 16 years has been captured by authorities in Mexico and awaits extradition to the U.S. to finish serving his sentence on charges of attempted capital murder of a police officer, state Department of Criminal Justice officials said Wednesday. 
 
 Juan Salaz was apprehended last week. The 37-year-old American citizen had been sought for years by authorities on both sides of the border. 
 
 Salaz escaped the night of March 22, 1997, from the Garza East prison in Beeville in South Texas by climbing over three 16-foot fences all topped with razor wire. 
 
 At the time, he was serving three concurrent 35-year sentences for aggravated kidnapping with a deadly weapon and two counts of attempted capital murder of a police officer for a 1995 incident involving two Houston officers. 
 
 He now also faces a felony escape charge besides serving the remainder of his sentence. 
 
 Prison records show on April 2, 1995, Salaz and another man, Geronimo Soto Alvarado, abducted a man at gunpoint and demanded a ransom. Houston police undercover officers involved in the case arranged for the exchange. After the abducted man was freed, they identified themselves as police and Salaz and Alvarado opened fire on them. A police sergeant avoided serious injury when he was saved by his body armor. Another officer suffered a hand wound. 
 
 Salaz was seriously wounded when police returned fire. He recovered from his injuries and subsequently pleaded guilty. 
 
 Alvarado, now 45, also was arrested and is serving a life sentence for two convictions of aggravated assault and another for aggravated kidnapping. 
 
 Prison officials said sources for years had told them Salaz was hiding out in Mexico but he managed to evade police. The hunt for him involved the U.S. Marshals Service, the Texas prison system's Office of Inspector General and Mexican law enforcement agencies. 
 
 "Salaz thought that he had eluded authorities by starting a new life in Mexico," Department of Criminal Justice Inspector General Bruce Toney said Wednesday. "He was wrong." 
 
 Salaz is to be returned to Texas custody once the Mexican government approves his extradition. 
 
 Salaz's capture leaves Jose Fernando Bustos-Diaz, 24, as the lone Texas prison fugitive. He fled in April 2010 from the Brisco Unit in Dilley, near San Antonio. The prison houses medium- and minimum-security inmates. He also is believed to have fled to Mexico. 
 
 Bustos-Diaz was serving 35 years for a 2005 murder in Harris County. ||||| Page 1 of 1

 Jose Salaz is the only prisoner to escape from the Texas prison system and still remain at large. 
 
 A man who escaped from a Texas prison 16 years ago has been captured in Mexico, authorities said Wednesday. 
 
 Juan Salaz, an American citizen, was captured last week and remains in Mexico awaiting extradition, authorities said. 
 
 Salaz escaped on March 22, 1997 from the Garza East Unit in Beeville, southeast of San Antonio. He was serving three concurrent 35 years sentences for two counts of attempted capital murder of a police officer and aggravated kidnapping with a deadly weapon. 
 
 He climbed over three 16-foot razor wire topped security fences. 
 
 As recently as three years ago, investigators suspected Salaz was is in the vicinity of Monterrey, Mexico. At that time, investigators said they suspected Salaz has crossed back and forth between Mexico and Texas with help from family in Houston. |||||

P.S. You’ve had a son for 61 years. 
 
 A man in Grand Rapids, Mich. last year learned about a son he never met after finding a letter his wife hid for decades. 
 
 The two finally met on Monday and are catching up on their better-late-than-never bond. 
 
 Tony Trapani, 81, told WXMI he found the letter when he was cleaning out his wife’s filing cabinets after her death. 
 
 The life-changing letter was sent to him more than 50 years ago from the mother of Tony’s then-unknown son, Samuel Childress. 
 
 “I have a little boy. He is five years old now. What I’m trying to say Tony is he is your son,” the long-lost lover wrote in the 1959 letter. 
 
 Childress, now 61, said his mother told him she sent the letter but she figured Trapani just ignored it. He grew up in Pennsylvania thinking his father never wanted to meet him. 
 
 The unexpected new dad now says his wife must have intercepted it and stashed it in the filing cabinet. The two of them, meanwhile, were unable to have their own children. 
 
 “He’s my full son that I’ve had my whole life,” Trapani tearfully told WMXI. “But why my wife hid that letter is beyond me.” 
 
 The letter remained hidden for more than 50 years after Tony Trapani's late wife hid it in a filing cabinet. (WXMI)

 GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- An elderly Grand Rapids man has finally met his son. 
 
 The man had tried having kids all his life, but thought it was a life goal he never accomplished. 
 
 "He's my full son that I've had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me." 
 
 A letter was sent by the child's mother more than 50 years ago that told him of his then 5-year-old son. That man is now 61-years-old. 
 
 It was a message believed to have been hidden by his wife for decades. 
 
 Tony Trapani, 81, said that after his wife passed away, he was cleaning out one of her old filing cabinets when he came across the letter. 
 
 Father and son only met for the first time Sunday, and Trapani said he feels like a new dad. 
 
 Samuel Childress was finally able to meet his father for the first time. 
 
 "I always asked my mom, I said, 'Well what does he look like?' She said, 'Well, go look in the mirror.'" 
 
 The letter sent by Samuel's mother back in 1959 is postage stamped on that date. 
 
 "I have a little boy," it reads. "He is five years old now. What I'm trying to say Tony is he is your son. He was born November 13th, 1953." 
 
 Childress said that his mother told him that she had sent the letter, but figured his father was ignoring him. 
 
 Trapani claims that his wife at the time intercepted the letter and hid it in a filing cabinet for decades while the couple couldn't conceive a child on their own. 
 
 "Why my wife didn't tell me," said Trapani. "I don't know. She wanted children. She couldn't have any. She tried and tried." 
 
 "He's my full son that I've had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me." 
 
 Childress said that while growing up, it was his understanding that his father got the letter, but didn't want anything to do with him. He grew up in Pennsylvania, and meeting his father was just a distant thought. 
 
 "Just to know him now is so important to me. It's going to fill that void," he said. 
 
 Father and son are now catching up on a lifetime of memories, making the most out of the time they have left, knowing they can't go back in time or dwell on the secret that kept them apart for so long. 
 
 The family is also planning to have a paternity test done just to be 100 percent sure. |||||

Facebook Inc. on Wednesday disavowed comments by company director and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen that appeared to support the colonization of India—sentiments which also received a ringing denunciation from the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. 
 
 Mr. Andreessen also apologized for the remarks, made late Tuesday on Twitter, after Indian regulators banned a Facebook program offering free access to a limited set of Internet sites. 
 
 ... ||||| Splash News/Corbis 
 
 Marc Andreessen needs to tweet a billion apologies. 
 
 The prominent Silicon Valley investor and Facebook board member on Wednesday took to Twitter to apologize for a series of offensive tweets he posted the night before. 
 
 The short missives touched a nerve because they appeared to reference India's colonial history. The world's second-most populous country, with more than a billion people, was a British colony until 1947. 
 
 Here's the backstory: On Monday, India's Telecom Regulatory Authority blocked Facebook's Free Basics, which seeks to bring a limited number of Internet sites and services for free to areas of the world where online access is unavailable. 
 
 The decision was part of a ruling on Net neutrality, the principle of equal access to all types of content and services on the Internet. Facebook, the country concluded, was violating those ideals by picking which services were accessible for free. 
 
 Andreessen, well known for his fiery Twitter personality, called the decision "morally wrong" because India was denying poor people at least partial Internet connectivity. Afterward, he responded to a tweet that suggested he supports "Internet colonialism." 
 
 "Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?" Andreessen wrote in a now-deleted tweet captured by Quartz and Business Insider. 
 
 Andreessen's venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, had no further comment. Andreessen said he withdrew his comments "in full and without reservation." 
 
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday tried to distance himself from his board member. "I want to respond to Marc Andreessen's comments about India yesterday," wrote Zuckerberg on his Facebook page. "I found the comments deeply upsetting, and they do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all." 
 
 A Facebook spokeswoman also reiterated the sentiment in a statement. "We strongly reject the sentiments expressed by Marc Andreessen last night regarding India." 
 
 Andreessen's faux pas comes as Silicon Valley companies increasingly try to woo India and other developing countries to their services. Google and SpaceX are also trying to beam down Internet access to rural regions via balloons and satellites, for example. 
 
 All of this comes as the technology sector becomes a bigger player on the world's stage. When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the US in September, he met with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook. |||||

 As he declared quasi-victory in Iowa following a third-place finish, Ron Paul puzzled cable news watchers across the country by proudly proclaiming, “We are all Austrians now.” The average Republican presidential candidate would sooner officiate a gay marriage than praise Europe, yet here was Paul pledging allegiance to Vienna. What did he mean? Why would we all be Austrians? 
 
 Paul’s statement was crystal clear to those familiar with the internecine controversies of the libertarian movement. He was referring to so-called “Austrian economics,” an idiosyncratic passion of his and a set of beliefs that put him at odds with the vast majority of well-known economists of all ideological inclinations. 
 
 For starters, it’s important to note that the term has something of a double meaning. The Austrian school originally referred to a set of classical liberal thinkers with diverse interests who came out of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Many of these thinkers are obscure today, but the most distinguished member of the group, Friedrich Hayek, is anything but. By the same token, an appreciation for Hayek’s work by no means makes you an “Austrian.” Hayek, who died in 1992, won the Nobel Prize, and mainstream economists thoroughly embraced his important work explicating the role of the price system in conveying information. His ideas undergird everything from carbon taxes to wireless spectrum auctions and thoroughly permeate policy throughout the Western world.

 But “Austrians” in Paul’s sense refers to something narrower, specifically the thought of Ludwig Von Mises and his student Murray Rothbard. It is a form of capitalism that is even more libertarian and anarchic than that espoused by many libertarians. Rothbard‘s followers, most prominently longtime Paul associate and founder of the Mises Institute Lew Rockwell, have been waging a decades-long war against the Koch brothers and the more mainstream form of libertarianism the Kochs represent. 
 
 “Austrian economics,” in this sense, goes beyond standard-issue free market thinking in a number of ways. Most notably, it seeks to build a strong ethical case for strict libertarianism without admitting that this would lead to any practical problems whatsoever. Therefore, along with rejecting the legitimacy of any intervention to protect the poor or regulate anything (a position much more extreme than even the Hayek of Road to Serfdom), Austrians reject the idea that there is anything at all the government can do to stabilize macroeconomic fluctuations. This, to be clear, is different from the mainstream Republican view that the stimulus bill enacted by Congress in 2009 and signed into law by President Obama was wasteful or ineffective. Austrians also believe that cutting taxes to boost economic activity doesn’t work either. And they disagree with Milton Friedman that appropriate monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve could have prevented the Great Depression. Indeed, they disagree with even the least controversial of all stabilization measures, the ordinary tweaking of short-term interest rates that all modern central banks use to try to prevent either inflation or deflation. In the view of the Austrians, practically every economic policy pursued by the federal government and Federal Reserve is a mistake that distorts markets. Rather than curing recessions, claim Austrians, stimulative policies cause them by producing unsustainable bubbles. 
 
 The way this works, according to the Austrians, is that artificially low interest rates spur “malinvestment” in unworkable enterprises that inevitably crash when the stimulus is withdrawn. This is an emotionally appealing idea, positing that the suffering of a bust is a kind of cosmic payback for the boom. But it doesn’t make much logical sense. For one thing, as George Mason University economist Bryan Caplan, who’s ideologically sympathetic to the Austrians, points out, it’s hard to understand why businesspeople would be so easily duped in this way. If Ron Paul and Ludwig von Mises know that cheap money can’t last forever, why don’t private investors? Why wouldn’t firms avoid making the supposedly dumb investments? Ironically, the Austrians have replicated an error from the crudest forms of postwar Keynesianism—the failure to consider the role of expectations feedback in macroeconomic policy. 
 
 More broadly, the Austrian story of investment booms and busts doesn’t actually explain recessions and unemployment. Spending patterns shift all the time without sparking a recession. People stop buying BlackBerrys and they buy iPhones instead. Or people stop buying boot-cut jeans and buy skinny jeans instead. Across sectors, maybe people go see fewer movies and with the money they save they eat out at nicer restaurants. A business that curtails its investment spending should have extra money to pay out as dividends. Or if they want to horde the cash, it sits in a bank for someone else to lend out.

 It may seem “obvious” that the decline in housing activity caused the current recession, in line with the Austrian view, but

In recent days, Democratic strategists have all but begged President Barack Obama to take control of a deepening public relations disaster that threatens to derail his second-term agenda. 
 
 On Wednesday evening, Obama began to do just that. The White House released 100 pages of emails and documents showing the evolution of the administration’s talking points about the Benghazi attack. Just over an hour later, Obama himself came to the podium to announce that he’d directed his treasury secretary to request the resignation of the acting IRS commissioner — and had gotten it.

 reset POLITICO Junkies: Obama damage control continues Obama IRS latest: ‘Inexcusable’ 
 
 The president also plans to appoint a new acting IRS commissioner this week, a senior administration official told POLITICO Thursday. 
 
 So has a string of decisive actions in the space of less than a day stopped the bleeding? 
 
 For Republicans, the answer is clearly no. They’re going to remain on the attack — and they’re upping their demands. Moments after Obama spoke, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called on Obama to apologize to the American people. “Simply allowing the acting head of the IRS to resign is not enough,” he said in a statement. 
 
 (PHOTOS: 10 slams on the IRS) 
 
 And Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said on CNN that while Obama “set exactly the right tone” on Wednesday night, the president must cooperate with Congress in the days ahead. 
 
 But after days of anxiety, Democratic operatives said the White House has found its footing. Still, happy as they were to see Obama win a news cycle, they insisted he’s far from being in the clear — Republican adversaries feel that they’re only just beginning, and they’ll have another chance to lay into the administration at Friday’s hearing on the IRS. 
 
 Obama’s top staff spent much of early Wednesday locked behind closed doors figuring out the best way to move ahead — without causing any new headaches — on all three fronts. The main problem, Obama aides say, was getting a fast decision on declassifying many of the Benghazi emails. 
 
 (PHOTOS: 10 slams on Obama and Benghazi) 
 
 Though the White House didn’t buy all of the advice that came from the outside — one Obama aide called the push for an external review a “half-assed” idea — there wasn’t much doubt that they needed to respond strongly, and they needed to get rid of IRS acting Commissioner Steven Miller. 
 
 “We needed to make sure we got it all right and could respond with as much force as possible on as many fronts as possible,” an Obama aide said. 
 
 (Also on POLITICO: State fretted over Benghazi talking points) 
 
 “Everyone says be fast, but fast is deadly if you are wrong. Always better to suffer through some news cycles to do it right, which is what the president did [Wednesday],” the aide added. “Our goal since Monday night when the AP revelation poured accelerant on the fire has been to tackle each of the three issues separately but forcefully and get back on offense as soon as possible. That wasn’t possible on Tuesday because we didn’t have the IG report and would not have been able to take decisive action at the IRS and we needed to get the emails declassified, which took time and pushed us into Wednesday.” 
 
 The president instructed Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to request and receive the resignation of acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller on Wednesday in the wake of the scandal over extra tax scrutiny given to conservative political groups. 
 
 The administration official said there is no timeline yet to appoint a permanent commissioner — which would require Senate confirmation. ||||| It says something about the kind of fortnight the president has been having that the controversies facing his administration can be divided into tiers. 
 
 The Benghazi debacle and the IRS’s targeting of conservative groups are, as it were, “tier one” scandals: the former because it involves obfuscation and cynical political calculation in the matter of the murder of four Americans by jihadists, the latter because it comprises systematic governmental discrimination against conservatives for exercising the core right to political speech. 
 
 The Justice Department’s seizure of phone records from the Associated Press, by contrast, is at least for now a second-tier concern. The confiscation is sure to chill the AP’s relationship with its sources, and normalizing such a practice would certainly chill the exercise of a free press. And there are questions to ask about the wisdom of the Justice Department’s specific actions, and about Attorney General Eric Holder’s odd recusal from the proceedings — a decision about which he admits making no formal record, and that he says prevents him from testifying to specifics.

MEXICO CITY—President Enrique Pe ⁇ a Nieto, facing the biggest crisis in his first two years in office, proposed a series of measures to confront lawlessness, starting with a cleanup of local police by putting them under the control of state governments. 
 
 The initiative to improve Mexico’s law enforcement and rampant corruption comes in response to public outrage over the abduction and suspected massacre of 43 college students who were detained by municipal police in the southern town of Iguala two months ago. Authorities said... ||||| MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico's president announced a nationwide anti-crime plan Thursday that would allow Congress to dissolve local governments infiltrated by drug gangs and give state authorities control over often-corrupt municipal police.

 The plan announced by President Enrique Pena Nieto came two months after 43 teachers college students disappeared in the Guerrero city of Iguala, allegedly killed and incinerated by a drug gang working with local police. Huge marches have been held to protest their disappearance. 
 
 Pena Nieto suggested his plan was influenced by the Iguala tragedy, noting its "cruelty and barbarity have shocked Mexico." 
 
 "Mexico cannot go on like this," he said. "After Iguala, Mexico must change." 
 
 As if to underscore the problem, authorities said Thursday that they had found the decapitated, partly burned bodies of 11 men dumped on the side of a road near another Guerrero city. 
 
 The president's plan would also relax the complex divisions between which offenses are dealt with at federal, state and local levels. At present, some local police refuse to act to prevent federal crimes like drug trafficking. It would also seek to establish a national identity number or document, though it was unclear what form that would take. 
 
 The plan would focus first on four of Mexico's most troubled states — Guerrero, Michoacan, Jalisco and Tamaulipas. More federal police and other security forces would be sent to the "hot land" region overlapping the first two states, where the government has already sent significant contingents of federal police and soldiers. 
 
 "My response to the police operation in the 'hot lands' is: 'What? Another one?'" said Mexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope, alluding to a string of previous anti-crime initiatives in the area. "The same as the others, for a limited time and without the right conditions?" 
 
 The reforms, some of which would require constitutional changes, will be formally presented next week. They would include a single, nationwide emergency telephone number, which the president said could be "911," as in the United States. But Pena Nieto was vague in describing some of the proposals. 
 
 The focus on corrupt local governments reflects the shocking accusations made about the mayor of Iguala, Jose Luis Abarca. Prosecutors say he collaborated with a local drug gang and ordered the detention of the students by local police, who turned them over to gang gunmen. 
 
 Municipal governments currently enjoy high levels of autonomy and control their own police forces, something the president is now seeking to weaken. But it is not clear whether the plan proposes to eliminate local police forces, or simply change their command structure. 
 
 Similar broad, federal anti-crime plans announced in 2004 and 2008 brought some improvements in areas such as vetting of police officers, but failed to prevent some entire municipal police forces from being coopted by crime gangs. As a result, Mexicans have become skeptical of such announcements. 
 
 "More than announcements, the public needs to see concrete actions that make this rhetoric seem believable," said Pedro Torres, a law professor at the Tecnologico de Monterrey university's school of government. "There is definitely nothing new here that they haven't tried to implement before." 
 
 Pena Nieto began his administration in 2012 hoping to concentrate on economic and legal reforms and avoid the focus on drug-gang violence that dominated the term of his predecessor

Boston’s New England Holocaust Memorial was targeted by a rock-throwing vandal for the second time in two months last night, when a teen shattered a glass panel etched with the numbers that Nazis tattooed on concentration camp victims, police said. 
 
 Police were called about 6:40 p.m. to the downtown landmark and said witnesses helped them identify a 17-year-old suspect. 
 
 The suspect’s name was not released because he is a juvenile. He is due to be arraigned today in Boston Municipal Court. Police were investigating the motive. ||||| The New England Holocaust Memorial in Boston was vandalized on Monday. 
 
 For the second time this summer, the New England Holocaust Memorial in Boston was vandalized when a 17-year-old allegedly threw a rock Monday evening through one of the glass panels, shattering it. 
 
 The male teenager, who is from Malden, was quickly tackled by two bystanders and held until police arrived. He is charged with willful destruction of property, and police are investigating whether the incident was a hate crime. 
 
 The vandalism, which happened just before 7 p.m., came just two days after a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. turned violent, and less than two months after a 21-year-old with a history of mental illness shattered a glass panel at the Boston memorial.

 The glass towers of the memorial, which was installed in 1995, had never been vandalized before the June incident.

 “It’s a reminder that we as a community need to be united, both in our opposition to all forms of hate but also in the important role that memorials play in our community,” said Robert Trestan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League. 
 
 Trestan said it was important to let the investigation unfold before jumping to conclusions, but said the destruction was jarring, no matter what the suspect’s motive was. 
 
 “It’s a second blow to the community, and it comes at a time when most of Boston is standing in solidarity [against] the hatred that we saw in Charlottesville over the weekend,” he said. 
 
 On Twitter, Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston wrote: “Today and every day Boston stands up against hate. I’m saddened to see such a despicable action in this great city.”

 In a statement, Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said “Clearly, this type of behavior will not be tolerated in our city. And, in light of the recent events and unrest in Charlottesville, it’s sad to see a young person choose to engage in such senseless and shameful behavior.” 
 
 At the memorial, police tape cordoned off two of the glass towers, and public works crews scooped up the glass with shovels. 
 
 Jeremy Burton, the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council, noted that the memorial in Boston stood for two decades before it was vandalized. 
 
 “It’s shocking and it’s particularly shocking for us in the Jewish community, coming as it does in a week in which so many of us spent our weekend watching Nazis marching in Virginia.” 
 
 Keith Bedford/Globe Staff Investigators looked at glass sitting on the ground after it was vandalized. 
 
 Burton said the panels on the memorial are made from a “very resilient” glass.

 “I can only say from what I know of the June attack, it takes a very, very conscious effort to break this glass,” he said. 
 
 Austin Giles was passing through the memorial and reading the panels, which bear numbers representing victims of the Holocaust, when he heard glass shatter on the opposite end. He saw police take the suspect into custody. 
 
 “I was just walking through and observing,” said Giles, who lives in Marshfield. “My first instinct was, what the hell? Did a rock hit it or something? I couldn’t fathom somebody would possibly do this.” 
 
 Scott Strauss and his family, who are visiting from Miami, said his grandparents on both sides of his family were Auschwitz survivors, and he wanted to show the memorial to his children. 
 
 Walking past the scene, Strauss explained to his 6-year-old that the memorial was for “grandpa.” 
 
 “It’s just awful,” he said. 
 
 “This right here doesn’t represent the city of Boston,” Strauss said. “It represents hate and evil.”

WASHINGTON — In July 2014, after Jonathan J. Pollard had served 29 years of a life sentence for spying on behalf of Israel, his hopes for freedom were thwarted when a federal panel denied his request for parole. 
 
 But that hearing set in motion an intense scramble by lawyers for Mr. Pollard to ensure a different result a year later, when he would be eligible for parole after serving 30 years. They wrote letters, cited statistics and introduced evidence that their client met two legal standards for parole: that he had behaved well in prison, and that he posed no threat of returning to a life of espionage. 
 
 On Tuesday, the effort finally succeeded, as the United States Parole Commission announced that Mr. Pollard, 60, met the legal standards and would be released just before Thanksgiving. 
 
 Mr. Pollard, one of the country’s most notorious spies, will walk out of federal prison in Butner, N.C., on Nov. 20. Eliot Lauer, one of the two lawyers who have been working pro bono for the past 15 years to free Mr. Pollard, called his client on Tuesday with the news. ||||| (CNN) Convicted spy for Israel Jonathan Pollard has been granted parole and will be released from an American jail on Nov. 21, his lawyer announced Tuesday. 
 
 Pollard's release -- exactly 30 years after his arrest -- could help ease the tensions between the United States and Israel that have grown over the Iran nuclear deal, which President Barack Obama supports and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vehemently opposes. Netanyahu has long sought Pollard's release, and the prospect has surfaced many times in discussions between the U.S. and Israel. 
 
 The White House has said it won't challenge the granting of parole for Pollard but denied his release was in any way connected to the Iran deal.

 "Mr. Pollard's status was determined by the United States Parole Commission according to standard procedures, and the Parole Commission's decision was in no way linked to foreign policy considerations," said National Security spokesman Alistair Baskey. "Mr. Pollard will serve his sentence as mandated by statute for the very serious crimes he committed The President has no intention of altering the terms of Mr. Pollard's parole." 
 
 Both the Justice Department and Pollard's pro bono attorneys, Eliot Lauer and Jacques Semmelman, confirmed his release date Tuesday.

Scott Weiland Will Filed ... Ex-Wife Wants to Call the Shots 
 
 Scott Weiland Will Filed ... Ex-Wife Wants to Call the Shots 
 
 EXCLUSIVE 
 
 The woman Scott Weiland divorced nearly 9 years ago, and often battled over his drug use, is asking the courts to name her the executor of his will ... TMZ has learned. 
 
 Mary Forsberg filed docs in L.A. saying Scott himself named her as executor, and she's filed a will with his signature as proof. Here's the catch ... the will was written in April 2007. That's right around the time Scott and Mary's marriage was falling apart, and when he was in the throes of addiction. 
 
 Mary wrote a memoir called 'Fall to Pieces' about life with Scott and his battles with drugs. 
 
 The docs say Scott had about $2 million in assets as part of his estate. He also created a trust during his lifetime that has undisclosed assets. 
 
 Scott's widow Jamie Wachtel was with him for 2 years before his death, and could still contest Forsberg's filing. ||||| Scott Weiland's Second Wife Mary Forsberg Takes Legal Action to be Named Executor of Late Rocker's Will 
 
 The battle over Scott Weiland 's assets has just intensified.The former Stone Temple Pilots singer's ex-wife Mary Forsberg filed court documents on Dec. 30 asking to be named the executor of Weiland's will (Weiland was married to his third wife Jamie Wachtel at the time of his death). Forsberg also filed a copy of the will, written in April 2007, with his signature as proof, according to papers obtained by PEOPLE.Weiland had about $2 million to his estate, and also created a trust that has undisclosed assets.Forsberg, who was his second wife, is the mother of Weiland's two children Noah, 15, and Lucy, 13. The mother of two penned her memories of Weiland and their marriage as well as his drug abuse in her memoir called Fall to Pieces. She also wrote an emotional letter in Rolling Stone days following Weiland's death. "The truth is, like so many other kids, they lost their father years ago. What they truly lost on December 3rd was hope," she wrote with contributions from her kids.The former Velvet Revolver band member married his third wife Jamie Wachtel in 2013. Weiland's first wife is Janina Castenada, whom he was married to from 1994 - 2000.Weiland died at the age of 48 on Dec. 3 while on tour with his band The Wildabouts in Bloomington, Minnesota. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office in Minnesota said a mix of cocaine, ethanol (alcohol), and MDA (a relative of ecstasy) led to the rock star's death. The press release, obtained by PEOPLE , also mentioned Weiland's history of cardiovascular disease, asthma, and multi-substance dependence as "significant conditions".A hearing date has been set for Feb. 5. |||||

Done for good. Marc Anthony and Shannon de Lima confirmed that they're divorcing in a joint statement to Us Weekly on Sunday, December 18. 
 
 “After much consideration, we have mutually and amicably decided to end our two-year marriage,” the couple said in the statement. “We ask for privacy during this difficult process, and no further comments will be made from either one of us about this personal matter.” 
 
 
 
 A source previously told Us that the couple had decided to end their union earlier this year. “It just was not working and they didn’t have enough in common,” the insider said of the 48-year-old singer and the 28-year-old Venezuelan model.

 The pair first began dating in 2012, just months after the Latin crooner and ex-wife Jennifer Lopez called it quits on their seven-year marriage. Anthony and de Lima wed in a romantic wedding ceremony in the Dominican Republic on November 11, 2014, after a brief break in 2013. 
 
 In November, Anthony and Lopez, 47, surprised fans when they shared a smooch on stage at the 17th annual Latin Grammy Awards. And a second insider revealed that the kiss may have been for more than show, telling Us that Anthony is “still in love” with his ex and “is trying to get back together with her.” 
 
 
 
 “As soon as he heard Jennifer split with Casper [Smart], he wanted out [of his marriage],” the source said. Lopez and Smart, 29, called off their relationship this past August after more than four years of dating. 
 
 Still, the path to a possible reconciliation may not be so easy. In April, Lopez got candid with W magazine when she revealed that she knew her marriage to Anthony was doomed from the start. 
 
 
 
 “When my marriage ended, it was not easy to find forgiveness,” the Shades of Blue actress said. “It wasn’t the dream that I had hoped for, and it would have been easier to fan the flames of resentment, disappointment and anger. But Marc is the father of my children, and that’s never going away. So I have to make things right. And that is, by far, the hardest work I do.” 
 
 
 
 The former couple share 8-year-old twins Emme and Max.

A government shutdown has become increasingly likely as conservatives ramp up pressure on House Republicans to reject a Senate bill restoring funding for ObamaCare. 
 
 
 
 Conservative activists say Speaker John Boehner’s (R-Ohio) credibility is on the line, and warn he will not serve another term as House GOP leader if he agrees to fund the Affordable Care Act along with the rest of government. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ADVERTISEMENT 
 
 Senate Democrats, however, say Boehner will be responsible for shutting down the government if he makes any changes to the stopgap bill that the Senate passed on Friday."I want everyone to listen and to hear: The United States Senate has acted," Reid said on the Senate floor. "This is the only legislation that can avert a government shutdown, and that time is ticking as we speak."Reid adjourned the Senate until 2 pm Monday, leaving the House to work out the government funding stalemate on its own. Reid’s staff said there are not any talks with Boehner on finding a compromise before the Oct. 1 deadline.Brent Bozell, the chairman of ForAmerica and a prominent conservative activist, said Boehner would face calls to step down if he accepts a stopgap spending measure that does not defund or delay ObamaCare.“He’s going to be threatened. If he chooses to side with Barack Obama and with the Democrats in order to fund ObamaCare, then he owns ObamaCare and he can’t get out of that.“He’ll be as responsible for ObamaCare as Harry Reid,” he said.Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, said conservative groups around the country on Friday began focusing a national grassroots lobbying campaign on House Republicans.She said Tea Party Patriots directed 10,000 calls a day to Senate offices while the upper chamber debated a resolution linking the stopgap with a measure defunding ObamaCare.Martin said there would be growing calls from conservatives around the country for Boehner to resign if he allows the Senate-passed stopgap to receive a vote on the House floor.“I think if he does that we’ll probably see people across this country in the grassroots calling for a new Speaker,” she said.The Senate stopgap bill does not include language defunding ObamaCare or prioritizing debt payments in the event that Congress fails to raise the debt limit. Both elements were in the original House bill.Threats from conservative activists are nothing new for Boehner. In March, Bozell blasted Boehner and other House GOP leaders for failing to deliver on the promises of the 2010 midterm election.Boehner’s spokesman on Friday said the House would not approve a government funding bill that fails to address the Affordable Care Act.“The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want the train wreck that is ObamaCare,” said Brendan Buck.House Republicans will meet at around noon on Saturday in the Capitol to plot their legislative strategy.“We are reviewing our options and will discuss them with members tomorrow,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner.Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) announced Friday afternoon that he would offer an amendment to the stopgap bill delaying ObamaCare until 2015. The proposal has 61 supporters.The mounting pressure from Tea Party groups and the tough rhetoric from House Republicans has alarmed senators who say a government shutdown appears more likely.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said the situation is more unpredictable now than in 2011, when Congress teetered on the brink of a government shutdown and then a possible national default.“Reading the tea leaves is more difficult. I think it is going to be difficult on the [funding bill] and it may be even more difficult on the debt ceiling,” Corker said. “I think it’s going to be tough for them.”Even if congressional leaders avoid a shutdown, they will face another showdown in mid-October over the debt limit. The administration says the nation’s borrowing authority must be increased by Oct. 17.President Obama on Friday said negotiating with Republicans on the government funding bill would only give them incentive to use the debt-ceiling and any future expiration of government funding as bargaining chips.“The bill that's designed to avert a government shutdown basically just funds the government for another couple months, so we could be doing this all over again,” he said. “I'm sure the American people are thrilled about that. And that's why we've got to break this cycle.”Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, said a shutdown is possible despite Senate passage of the stopgap.“Some of the Democrats think they can provoke a shutdown and they can blame the Republicans for it,” he said.House Republican leaders might focus now on trying to buy time, possibly by passing a weeklong stopgap.A senior Senate GOP aide discounted that possibility, however.“Passing a weeklong CR isn’t going to get you anywhere. Anything that can’t pass now won’t pass in a week or two weeks,” said

The text on the video above was edited on June 1, 2018 to make it clear that it is impossible to know why the polar bear pictured was starving. An earlier version of the video went too far in suggesting that climate change was responsible ( read more ). This story was updated on January 19, 2018 to reflect the more specific location of where the photographs were taken. 
 
 When photographer Paul Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Island—near the larger Baffin Island—in the Canadian Arctic in late summer, they came across a heartbreaking sight: a starving polar bear on its deathbed. 
 
 Nicklen is no stranger to bears. From the time he was a child growing up in Canada's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild. But the emaciated polar bear, featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5, was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he's ever seen. 
 
 "We stood there crying—filming with tears rolling down our cheeks," he said. 
 
 Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear's back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground. 
 
 In the days since Nicklen posted the footage, he's been asked why he didn’t intervene. 
 
 "Of course, that crossed my mind," said Nicklen. "But it's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat." 
 
 And even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear's misery. Plus, feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada. 
 
 The wildlife photographer says he filmed the bear's slow, beleaguered death because he didn't want it to die in vain. 
 
 "When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like. Bears are going to starve to death," said Nicklen. "This is what a starving bear looks like." 
 
 The Climate Change Link? 
 
 By telling the story of one polar bear, Nicklen hopes to convey a larger message about how a warming climate has deadly consequences. 
 
 Polar bears have long been unwitting mascots for the effects of climate change. As animals that live only in Arctic regions, they're often the first to feel the impacts of warming temperatures and rising seas. 
 
 The large, half-ton bears find concentrations of seals on sea ice. During summer months, it's not uncommon for polar bears to go months without eating while they wait for Arctic ice to solidify. 
 
 In 2002, a World Wildlife Fund report predicted that climate change could eventually lead to polar bear endangerment or extinction. Even then, the report found that polar bears were moving from ice to land earlier and staying on land longer, unhealthily extending the bears' fasting season. By the end of summer, most bears studied by the World Wildlife Fund showed signs of starvation. 
 
 Fifteen years later, polar bears' icy hunting grounds are in even worse shape. The National Snow and Ice Data Center, which tracks sea ice cover annually, has regularly noted record lows in sea ice coverage—a decline that is expected to only get worse. (Read more about drastic predictions for dwindling sea ice.) 
 
 A study recently published in the journal Biosciences looked at how climate science is often falsely discredited. The study found climate deniers are able to downplay the threat of climate change by discrediting the threat facing polar bears. ||||| The world’s tragedies often have images that end up defining them: A five-year old screaming in Iraq after her parents were killed by U.S. soldiers. A starving child being stalked by a vulture during a ruthless famine in Sudan. 
 
 A video released this week of an extremely emaciated polar bear has served as a similar purpose: as a rallying cry and stand-in for a largely unmitigated environmental disaster. 
 
 The video was shot by Paul Nicklen, a nature photographer and contributor to the National Geographic magazine for the last 17 years. He is also a biologist by training and the co-founder of Sea Legacy, a nonprofit that uses storytelling and images to advocate for the environment. 
 
 Nicklen’s video, which he shot on a trip for Sea Legacy, depicts an emaciated polar bear, its coat patchy, seemingly near death on an island in a Canadian territory inside the Arctic Circle. It searches for food in a rusted garbage can and chews what Nicklen said was an old snowmobile seat.

Mr. Holder has said little publicly about the investigation. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, asked by reporters in December why it was taking so long, said: “I can’t say. I mean, I guess I could say, but I won’t say.” 
 
 Marc Raimondi, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment on the investigation. 
 
 At a news conference shortly after Mr. Petraeus resigned, President Obama said he had no evidence that Mr. Petraeus had disclosed classified information “that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security.” 
 
 “We are safer because of the work that Dave Petraeus has done,” Mr. Obama said, referring to his career in government. “And my main hope right now is — is that he and his family are able to move on and that this ends up being a single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career.” 
 
 But investigators concluded that, whether or not the disclosure harmed national security, it amounted to a significant security breach in the office of one of the nation’s most trusted intelligence leaders. They recommended that Mr. Petraeus face charges, saying lower-ranking officials had been prosecuted for far less. 
 
 Federal agents stumbled onto the affair after Jill Kelley, a friend of Mr. Petraeus’s, complained to the F.B.I. that she had received anonymous threatening emails about her relationship with Mr. Petraeus. F.B.I. agents opened a cyberstalking investigation, traced the message to Ms. Broadwell and began searching her emails. That is when they discovered evidence that she and Mr. Petraeus were having an affair. 
 
 Mr. Petraeus is said to have begun the affair with Ms. Broadwell in 2011, soon after taking the job at the C.I.A. and while she was interviewing him for her book, “All In: The Education of General David Petraeus.” 
 
 Mr. Petraeus resigned from the C.I.A. three days after Mr. Obama was re-elected. In a brief statement, Mr. Petraeus admitted to the affair, saying that “after being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment.” ||||| Play Facebook

 Federal prosecutors handling the case of David Petraeus, the former director of the CIA, have recommended that charges be filed against him for mishandling classified information, according to federal officials. 
 
 No charges have been filed, and it's up to Attorney General Eric Holder to decide whether the facts assembled by the FBI, and the case built by prosecutors, merit going to court. 
 
 Petraeus, a retired four-star general and once America's top man in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, became CIA director in 2011. The question has been whether he gave classified information to a woman who was writing a book about him — a woman who was also his mistress. 
 
 He acknowledged the affair when he stepped down after leading the CIA for about a year. 
 
 Neither Justice Department nor his lawyer, who has always insisted Petraeus did nothing wrong, had immediate comment. One federal official said this leak, first reported by The New York Times, is an effort to put pressure on Holder to bring charges, especially given that other, lower-level government officials have been charged with leaking classified information.

The Arnolds are having a baby. Unless the public votes to have the child aborted. Meet the couple behind Birthornot.com, where "you can vote and choose whether we abort or keep our unborn child." 
 
 Pete and Alisha Arnold, both 30, both tech professionals, live in the Minneapolis suburb of Apple Valley and have been married for 10 years. Since September, they've blogged about their expected child at birthornot.com, posting health updates about the mother and the fetus (which will be 17 weeks-old tomorrow), and ultrasound pictures and video. But at the top of the blog is a poll hosted by PollDaddy.com. The question: "Should We Give Birth or Have an Abortion?" "Give Birth" has 46 percent of the vote at the moment, with "Have an Abortion" at 54 percent. The poll closes on December 7th. 
 
 Pete told us over the phone that on that day he plans to check Polldaddy's records to make sure there hasn't been any double-voting or other evidence of fraud and then he and Alisha will use the results to decide whether to keep the baby. They'll have two days to make a decision before the 20th week of Alisha's pregnancy ends, and, with it, her last chance to get an abortion. The poll will influence their decision heavily, the couple said by phone this evening, but it won't be binding. "It's kind of like Congress. They might vote for something, but the president has the final veto. If it's overwhelming one way or the other, that will carry a lot more weight." 
 
 That someone would do this is almost impossible to believe, of course. We asked the Arnolds if this was some sort of a prank. "No, it's not. We are taking this very seriously," Pete replied. We then asked if this was some sort of convoluted pro-life stunt. Alisha laughed. "It's definitely not a pro-life campaign," she said. "I believe in a woman's right to choose." 
 
 According to the couple, they've been unsure about whether they're ready to be parents and have concluded that the best way to proceed is to ask random people on the Internet if they should have the child. (Tests have revealed that the fetus is a boy.) Alisha said that two pregnancies ended in two miscarriages in the past year and a half. During the second pregnancy, the couple bought the birthornot.com domain, and were in the process of deciding whether to put the birth up to a vote when they lost the baby. When Alisha got pregnant a third time a few months ago, they decided to launch birthornot.com. 
 
 Pete, who described himself as a Libertarian, framed the couple's majority-rule abortion as kind of an extreme civics lesson that he hoped would bring the abortion debate home. "Voting is such an important part of who we are as a people," Pete said. "Here's a chance where people can be heard about whether they are pro-choice or whether they are pro-life, and it makes a difference in the real world." 
 
 We pointed out an obvious flaw with his logic: The vast majority of people who are pro-choice aren't pro-abortion, so it wouldn't figure that they would automatically vote for the abortion option. The only people who would probably vote for the abortion are trolls who want to piss off pro-lifers. (In fact the anarchic message board 4chan has already hijacked the poll a couple times, tilting it to the "abortion" side.) Pete countered that during elections, "people do silly stuff all the time, and their votes get counted anyway." 
 
 We're not sure what to make of Pete and Alisha Arnold, to be honest. But here are three possibilities: 
 
 1) It's is an idiotic prank. Pete and Alisha are intent on becoming famous any way they can, and they've hit on an outrageous way to get media coverage. But if this all was a prank, wouldn't they have gotten the word out before now? They've been blogging since September. 
 
 2) This is a pro-life stunt. Pete said he's a non-practicing Catholic, while Alisha is a Methodist. Although the Arnolds describe themselves as political independents with Libertarian leanings, Alisha likes Glenn Beck on Facebook, and a Google search turns up an old pro-Bush comment Pete made on CNN. (Pete said he voted for Bush in 2000, but not in 2004.) Could this site be a confused parable to illustrate the peril of putting an unborn baby's life in the hands of voters? 
 
 3) It's true. Pete and Alisha are actually going to choose to have an abortion based on an Internet poll.

The sister of the Redding-area woman who vanished three weeks ago only to be found early Thanksgiving morning on the side of a road in Yolo County says the family is elated and relieved that Sherri Papini has been reunited with them. 
 
 “This has been the most amazing Thanksgiving that our family could ever ask for,” Sheila Koester said Friday in a phone interview with The Sacramento Bee. “We’re all very, very, very excited, very, very relieved and just very thankful for getting our Sherri back.” 
 
 Koester declined to say whether Sherri Papini, 34, has seen her two young children or if she’s made it back the rural home she shares with her husband, Keith, in Mountain Gate, Shasta County, a mile from where she disappeared after going for a jog on Nov. 2. 
 
 “What I can say is that her and Keith have been reunited,” Koester said. “And that they are very happy to be together and they're very thankful for everyone for allowing them to have their privacy and allowing them to recover from their situation that all of us have been in.”

 Papini was found around 4:30 a.m. Thursday after she flagged down a driver on Interstate 5 in Yolo County, Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said Thursday in a news conference. 
 
 Investigators say Papini was bound with restraints when she was let out of a sport-utility vehicle near a freeway interchange in the town of Yolo. They say she was able to flag down a motorist on the freeway near County Road 17. 
 
 “CHP is on scene and advised that she is chained to something,” a radio dispatcher told a responding officer Thursday in an audio clip obtained by The Sacramento Bee. “CHP is advising that she is heavily battered.” 
 
 Authorities are searching for two women armed with a handgun. 
 
 SHARE COPY LINK Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko says he is "ecstatic" to report that Sherri Papini has been located and reunited with her husband and family on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24, 2016. "Sherri is now safe," he said, after being taken capti Randall BentonThe Sacramento Bee 
 
 Papini’s husband, Keith, reported Sherri Papini missing on Nov. 2 after she didn’t pick up her two young children from day care that afternoon, something her family members say was completely out of character for the devoted mom. 
 
 Bosenko said at a Thursday news conference that Papini was injured during her abduction, but did not provide details on the extent of her injuries. She was treated at a hospital in the Sacramento area and released. Koester said she’s met with her sister, but she declined to provide details about her condition. 
 
 The sheriff said police are looking for two Hispanic women driving a dark-colored SUV in connection with the abduction, based on Papini’s description. Authorities have no other information about the captors, including other details of their appearance or clothing. 
 
 On Friday, Koester expressed gratitude to investigators, search teams and media outlets for keeping Papini’s story alive. Koester said she’s hopeful her sister’s abductors will be found. 
 
 She also thanked the motorist, who hasn’t yet been identified by detectives, who stopped for Papini on the side of the road. 
 
 “We appreciate that person stopping and helping her,” she said. 
 
 One woman posted on social media after Papini was found to say she saw her on the side of the road and called 911, but didn’t stop. 
 
 “I couldn’t stop in time to help you this morning but I did pull over and report to police that I saw you by the road and was certain you needed help,” said Alison Sutton, who posted on a Facebook page dedicated to finding Papini. “I am thankful that someone else was able to pull over safely to help you and that you are safe. God bless you and your family.” 
 
 “Thank you very much for alerting the police,” replied Rod Rodriguez III, who says he’s Sherri’s father-in-law. “We greatly appreciate your assistance.” 
 
 “I don’t know that my call helped her,” she wrote in a follow-up post. “I am very thankful she is safe and back with her family. This is truly a Thanksgiving to remember.” 
 
 Rodriguez didn’t returned a phone message left Friday at his home near Redding. Sutton couldn’t be reached for comment. 
 
 The Sacramento Bee on Friday morning requested 911 tapes and dispatch logs from the California Highway Patrol and the Yolo County Sheriff’s Office, but the agencies haven’t

In the wake of the Oregon shooting, it now looks as if political gunfights will be breaking out all over the presidential race. How to combat gun violence could become a real issue in the 2016 race: The Republican presidential candidates have seemed to adopt the position that there is little the federal government can do about it, and today, in an effort to contrast with that willfully defeatist posture, Hillary Clinton rolled out some concrete proposals. 
 
 Clinton’s new plan, which she will discuss on the campaign trail today, includes a raft of ideas: closing loopholes in the background check system; more aggressive action to revoke the licenses of gun dealers who knowingly supply so-called “straw purchasers”; and repealing a law that protects gun manufacturers from liability for gun violence. 
 
 But the most controversial aspect of Clinton’s plan is this: She vowed to take executive action to partly close the loophole that allows private sellers to peddle guns without a background check if Congress doesn’t. 
 
 Clinton’s campaign says that this could theoretically be accomplished via a new rule by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that would more clearly define what it means to be “engaged in the business” of selling firearms. Gun control advocates point out that under federal law, those “engaged in the business” of selling firearms must perform background checks, but federal regulations defining that phrase are too vague, allowing too many gun sales to proceed without such a check. Such federal regs, they say, could be changed through executive action that, for example, would set a clearer threshold defining “engaged in the business” of selling firearms in terms of the number of guns sold. 
 
 Arkadi Gerney, a gun policy expert at the Center for American Progress, tells me what Clinton’s new policy proposal means: 
 
 “One way you could do this would be to have a clear numerical threshold on the number of gun sales.” 
 
 “The statute says that anyone engaged in the business of selling firearms must apply for a federal license. Like any other statute where it’s vague, there’s the potential to define it further. You could update the regulation and have a more clear threshold. You couldn’t say, we define ‘engaged in the business’ as anyone who sells a gun ever. But you could change the regulation to be more focused, more narrow, and less vague than it currently is, which makes it very hard to prosecute people who abuse the law and are selling tens and hundreds of guns as private sellers. 
 
 But if Clinton could do this as president, couldn’t Obama do this by executive action right now? Gerney thinks the answer is Yes: 
 
 “Clinton’s idea of clarifying further what kind of gun sellers are engaging in business and need to get a license to sell guns is a smart one. She’s right that the President can do more to define the current law on what level of gun-selling activity triggers the requirement to conduct background checks. And, by putting this idea forward it is something of an implicit challenge to the current administration to move forward along these lines.” 
 
 More on this later, but this raises new questions: Is Obama, who has been visibly frustrated by government inaction, thinking of undertaking such an executive action? Will Clinton’s public vow to undertake such action raise the pressure on the administration to do the same? 
 
 Meanwhile, Clinton’s new proposal seems like an implicit challenge to Bernie Sanders, who has been criticized as insufficiently committed to gun reform. And the vow of action — including executive action — also seems designed to project an urgency that will contrast sharply with the decided lack of urgency projected by the GOP presidential candidates. But that brings us to our next item.

 “You were not allowed to have guns at all in that particular area. And you could make the case that it woulda been a lot better had people had guns because they had something to fire back.” 
 
 So, is more armed security Trump’s answer? Pressed on that question, the brash, get-it-done billionaire demurred again. Deporting 11 million people is a piece of cake, but gun violence is a problem we can’t even begin to debate trying to solve.

 Great Maritime Museum in Vancouver, British Columbia. The location is St. Roch, where the famous ship St. Roch is part of the exhibition. The ship was the first ship in history who traveled around Canada and the USA over the north passage and trough the Panama Canal! You will learn a lot about the history of British Columbia and it first European visitors from Spain and later from Britain and France, but also about the First Nation people. This Museum is also fantastic for families with children. Their are birthday celebrations called "Pirate Parties". Wish you wonderful hours there! 
 
 This was one of my favorite activities from Vancouver. I'm normally not a huge museum fan but this one is very unique and focuses mostly on the maritime history of Vancouver and Canada as a whole. There is a lot of stuff about the Northwest Passage and I learned a lot that I never would've learned if I hadn't come to this museum. The ship inside is very cool to climb around and explore. It's crazy to me that an Inuit family lived on deck to help the sailors while on an expedition. There was also a changing art gallery part of the building as well as a walk through area with more artifacts and bits of history. The museum as a whole is pretty old- it's nothing fancy and new. It has an old building smell, if you know what I mean. It's not too bad, though. The bathrooms were clean and the people working the front desk were helpful in calling us a taxi to get back downtown. We took a taxi there and he went to the wrong location at first- guess it's not as common a destination as I thought. He didn't charge us for the mistake though and it ended up being a pretty cheap ride. If you're interested in maritime history or just want a unique take on Vancouver's history, this is a great place to go. Kids would have fun too, as there are a few interactive exhibits. 
 
 Great museum to visit during vacation. My kids loved it. 
 
 Its ok. I noticed this museum doesn't have much new things. It seems to be the same thing over and over again. I used to come here a lot because I was part of the Vancouver Tourism group, now not so much. I guess they take pride in the giant ship inside the museum. Parking is not free here but further away, it could be if there are no signs that says with permit. Staff are friendly here. I don't find it too special here because its very similar to any Maritime museum you see else where. But I guess you have to have interest in it to find it interesting. 
 
 Loved it, you can climb on the boat, check out crew's cabin. There are organized activities for kids too, saw a guy signing "In summer" from Frozen in a costume :D 
 
 Super museum for kids and I learned a lot. Knowledgeable staff and great historical exhibits. My kids did not want to leave even though they were dead tired. 
 
 Terrific little, but fairly dated, maritime museum. My daughter enjoyed the play area and she also enjoyed exploring the St. Roch. I found the model ships interesting to look at and learned a lot about local history. The look and feel of the place is very 1960s, which adds to ambiance of the place. Off the beaten path museums like this can be great and this one doesn't disappoint. 
 
 A great way to learn about the Maritime history of Vancouver. Parking is available in a pay lot out front, or for free across the street. Hmm.. Admission is $11 for an adult, but on Thursdays between 1700-2000, it's admission by donation. Shh.. The museum is a bit quirky - I wasn't sure if some exhibits were missing when I first walked in. There are some cool whale tooth carvings - let's just say that some sailors have very dirty minds. I don't blame them. When you're out at sea for that long.. One fun little exhibit is this small remote-controlled submersible that can be controlled with buttons on the side of the display. I seriously got all giggly messing with this thing. Of course, the centrepiece exhibit is the St. Roch - the 1st ship to circumnavigate North America (via the Northwest Passage and Panama Canal). They do tours once in a while, so be sure to hang out by the admissions booth at the correct time. The boat itself is nothing spectacular unless you appreciate the history - and how ridiculously small the living quarters are! I don't know how the crew did it. This is one of those places you should check out at some point if you want to call yourself a Vancouverite

Image copyright IS video 
 
 Islamic State militants have released a video, featuring a man and young boy speaking with British accents, purportedly showing the killing of five men who it says were spying for the UK. 
 
 In the 10-minute film, the man threatens attacks in the UK and says this is a message for David Cameron. 
 
 A boy later appears in the video, which has not been independently verified, talking about killing "unbelievers". 
 
 The UK Foreign Office said it was examining the video's content. 
 
 'Extraordinary duress' 
 
 In the new video, the masked jihadi militant, who is holding a gun, mocks Mr Cameron for daring to "challenge the might" of the extremist group before he makes a threat to British people to "invade your land". 
 
 The five men, wearing jumpsuits, are seen purportedly being shot in the back of the head in a desert location, after making what is claimed to be their confessions. 
 
 But BBC World Service Middle East editor Alan Johnston says they appear to be "speaking under the most extraordinary duress" and "may be entirely innocent".

 One of the men says he had been asked to provide information about the location of IS militants, including two Britons, apparently to help target them with air strikes. 
 
 Some of the five men say that they are from Raqqa in Syria while another says he is from Benghazi, Libya, but none that they are from the UK. 
 
 After the apparent killings, the young boy, who seems to be aged around six or seven years old, is seen pointing into the distance, wearing military-style clothing. 
 
 IS has repeatedly used children in its propaganda videos. 
 
 Analysis 
 
 By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent 
 
 It is less than two months since British IS propagandist Mohammed Emwazi, the man known as Jihadi John, was killed by a drone strike in Syria. 
 
 This latest video by IS seems to show another man trying to take up his mantle. 
 
 The identity of the masked man is so far unknown but authorities will be trying to identify him and confirm if he is British. 
 
 Emwazi was killed after intelligence - most likely from informers - located him in a vehicle in Raqqa, Syria. 
 
 The fact that this latest video shows the killing of alleged spies indicates the extent to which IS is trying to track down those who might be providing information. 
 
 Children also regularly feature in IS propaganda videos and the brief appearance of a child - apparently with a British accent - at the end of the video will also most likely be of interest to the authorities. 
 
 Alan Johnston says the release of the video comes in the aftermath of a "major military setback for IS" after it recently lost control of much of the Iraqi city of Ramadi. 
 
 He adds: "It's possible this is aimed at distracting attention from that defeat - an effort to shock watching Westerners and shift their focus." 
 
 Following the death of Mohammed Emwazi, the Briton who became known as Jihadi John, this new video shows "something of a replacement" for him, says our correspondent. 
 
 "That masked militant becomes the new masked face of the Islamic State, at least for British viewers." 
 
 Jonathan Russell, head of policy at the Quilliam Foundation think tank, said it was "shocking" to hear British voices and to see a child in the video, but that both were being used "to reinforce the IS brand". 
 
 "These symbols are really reinforcing its terror - this is terrorism in its truest sense," he told the BBC News Channel. 
 
 "And what we've got to be very careful to do is not simply reinforce this terror but to debunk it and to say, look, it's projecting falsehoods, it's showing definitely not the reality on the ground in Iraq and Syria at the moment and it doesn't offer anything to potential recruits here in the West." ||||| Skip Ad x Embed x Share A new execution video released by the Islamic State features a familiar figure and threat.

Angelina Jolie Wows the Crowd at Comic-Con 
 
 Email This Actress Actress Angelina Jolie was a showstopper at the annual fan convention Comic-Con in San Diego, California on Thursday, The Huffington Post reports. The gorgeous brunette delighted fans when she took the stage in a skintight leather jacket, form-fitting black pencil skirt, and open-toe black heels. 
 
 Jolie, 35, joined 'Salt' co-star Liev Schreiber for a panel on their upcoming film. The actress revealed she fell on set and was pretty freaked out when she couldn't hear anything, UsWeekly reports. "I thought I'd had a concussion, but I had forgotten that I had my earplugs in from [shooting] the gun!" she said.She also talked about the weapons she used while shooting 'Salt': "I got to play with just about everything," she said, "including using a fire extinguisher in a way I'd never used it."When she compared her new movie to past films she's done like 'Wanted' and the 'Tomb Raider' series, she said, "My style got meaner and harder and darker, it wasn't as pretty. I think this is a better action movie than the ones I've done." ||||| Kevin Winter/Getty Images 
 
 While Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have been making the lovey-dovey rounds in support of her new film Salt (next stop, today at Comic-Con!), their attorneys have been working to kill—at least temporarily—another round of bogus breakup rumors. 
 
 This morning, while the power couple presumably snoozed away in L.A., their lawyers in London accepted an undisclosed settlement (earmarked for charity, of course), from the British tab News of the World for making "false and intrusive allegations." 
 
 Brangelina called in the dogs after the rag published a story back on Jan. 24 purporting the pair had met with a Los Angeles divorce lawyer to quietly divide their assets, hash out a custody deal and financially provide for their six children in advance of what the tab claimed was going to be a messy separation. 
 
 Fail. 
 
 While the newspaper hastily removed from the offending article from its website, it refused to acknowledge the information was untrue. In turn, the Brangelina's-divorcing rumor gained plenty of traction around the world, and no doubt caused the couple plenty of agita. 
 
 "When the News of the World failed to publicly retract the allegations and apologize for them—thereby leaving their readers in the dark as to the true position—the couple felt they had no alternative than to sue," their attorney, Keith Schilling, said in a statement. "Today's victory marks the end of the litigation brought by Brad and Angelina." 
 
 Unshockingly, aside from confirming the settlement, the News of the World didn't have much to say about their trip to the legal woodshed.

 Aboard Southwest Flight 812, Shawna Malvini Redden covered her ears, then felt a brisk wind rush by. Oxygen masks fell, the cabin lost pressure, and Redden, now suddenly lightheaded, fumbled to maneuver the mask in place. 
 
 Then she prayed. And, instinctively, reached out to the stranger seated next to her in Row 8 as the pilot of the damaged aircraft began a rapid descent from about 34,400 feet in the sky. 
 
 "I don't know this dude, but I was like, 'I'm going to just hold your hand,'" Redden, a 28-year-old doctoral student at Arizona State University, recalled Saturday, a day after her Phoenix-to-Sacramento flight was forced into an emergency landing at a military base in Yuma, Ariz., with a hole a few feet long in the roof of the passenger cabin. 
 
 No serious injuries were reported among the 118 people aboard, according to Southwest officials. 
 
 What caused part of the fuselage to rupture on the 15-year-old Boeing 737-300 was a mystery, and investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived Saturday in Yuma to begin an inquiry. 
 
 NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said investigators were going to cut a piece out of the fuselage, which would be studied for fracture patterns. He said they would also examine the plane's black box and flight recorders, which arrived Saturday at NTSB headquarters in Washington, D.C. 
 
 Southwest, meanwhile, grounded about 80 similar planes so that they could be inspected, and said that as a result some 300 flights were being canceled Saturday. Airline spokeswoman Linda Rutherford said it was too soon to estimate the cost of grounding a portion of its fleet. 
 
 Southwest operates about 170 of the 737-300s in its fleet of about 540 planes, but it replaced the aluminum skin on many of the 300s in recent years, Rutherford said. The planes that were grounded Saturday have not had their skin replaced, she said.

Syrian Deputy Prime Minister Qadri Jamil this week dismissed as mere election politics President Obama's implicit threat to intervene should the Syrian regime deploy its chemical weapons stockpile. (Andrey Smirnov, AFP/Getty Images / ) 
 
 WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has made contingency plans to send small teams of special operations troops into Syria if the White House decides it needs to secure chemical weapons depots now controlled by security forces loyal to President Bashar Assad, senior U.S. officials said. 
 
 President Obama warned this week that any effort by Assad to move or use his arsenal of chemical munitions in the country's conflict would cross a "red line," implying it could prompt swift U.S. intervention. 
 
 But Pentagon planners are more focused on protecting or destroying any Syrian stockpiles that are left unguarded and at risk falling into the hands of rebel fighters or militias aligned with Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or other militant groups. 
 
 Securing the sites would probably involve stealthy raids by special operations teams trained to handle such weapons, and precision airstrikes to incinerate the chemicals without dispersing them in the air, the officials said. U.S. satellites and drone aircraft already maintain partial surveillance of the sites. 
 
 U.S. intelligence agencies believe Syria has over the years produced or acquired hundreds of tons of sarin nerve agent and mustard gas, a blister agent, and has sought to develop VX, another powerful nerve gas. The toxicity of some chemical agents degrades significantly over time, so it is unclear how lethal the stockpiles are. 
 
 Experts say the chemical agents are stored in bunkers and other sites around the country. Four production facilities are near the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs, all tinderboxes in the 17-month uprising, as well as the coastal city of Latakia, an area considered a stronghold for Assad's Alawite religious sect. 
 
 An unclassified report by the director of national intelligence this year said Syria's chemical agents "can be delivered by aerial bombs, ballistic missiles and artillery rockets." But Syrian rockets, including Scud missiles procured from North Korea, are notoriously inaccurate, making them ineffective for delivering a heavy concentration of toxic chemicals to a specific target. 
 
 They can be very effective, however, at creating chaos. 
 
 "The actual killing may be less important than the panic they would induce," said Leonard Spector, who heads the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. 
 
 Although he did not make an explicit threat, Obama's comments at the White House on Monday were widely seen as a direct warning to Assad that the U.S. would take military action if necessary to stop the use of chemical weapons. But officials said later that no large-scale U.S. intervention is likely unless it is part of an international coalition. 
 
 "You shouldn't interpret what Obama said to mean that there would be automatic military action, but rather that we would respond as part of an international effort," said one senior official. 
 
 Officials said Obama could make a unilateral decision, however, to order special forces teams to stop weapons of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands. 
 
 Pentagon officials and senior military officers said the Syrian stockpiles seem well guarded for now, and they stressed that the White House has not ordered detailed planning of operations aimed at securing the facilities. 
 
 "We have done contingency planning but we're not doing detailed planning — identifying numbers [of troops], units and platforms — until the White House tells us we need a specific plan for this," a senior officer said. 
 
 Although U.S. officials said they are closely monitoring the unconventional weapons sites, they also acknowledge the stockpiles are large enough that some materials, such as small artillery shells filled with chemical agents, could be relocated without their knowledge. 
 
 U.S. officials told reporters last month that they had evidence Syrian forces were moving some chemical arms, apparently to keep them away from areas of fighting. 
 
 Assad's government has said it will not use chemical munitions against the Syrian people, though it has implied they could be used if foreign troops sought to intervene in the war. 
 
 "Any chemical or bacterial weapon will never be used — and I repeat will never be used — during the crisis in Syria, regardless of the developments," Jihad Makdissi, a Syrian government spokesman, told reporters last month. "These weapons are stored and secured by Syrian military forces and under its direct supervision and will never be used unless Syria faces external aggression." 
 
 Analysts say it's unclear how much of the chemical arsenal could be deployed, and they note that the agents, particularly VX and sarin, may have weakened if the regime isn't regularly refilling its stocks. U.S. intelligence officials have said that Syria, which is under international sanctions, relies heavily on foreign

 Note: This story has been updated for clarity. 
 
 Before the Republican winner of the Iowa Caucus had been determined on Tuesday night, Vermont’s independent Senator Bernie Sanders appeared on the set of Comedy Central’s The Colbert Report, touting a new book and his petition to overturn the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision by way of a Constitutional amendment. “Corporations are not people,” Sanders told host and satirist-comedian Stephen Colbert, who portrays a right-leaning pundit on the show. “They do not have freedom of expression rights in terms of buying elections.” 
 
 
 
 Sanders has not been standing his ground alone. From the Iowa campaign trail to the Montana Supreme Court, and from New York to California, the wake of Citizens United has rippled across the country this week in a range of political, judicial, and media encounters—a veritable mélange of sudden (and sobering?) reckoning with the ruling that changed the parameters for corporate involvement in American political life. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Two years ago this month, the high court ruled that corporations have First Amendment free speech rights and that they can make unlimited donations for electioneering, making way for anonymous political spending and the formation of super PACs, which are not limited in how much money they can receive from corporate donors. 
 
 
 
 Until now, the only real-world electoral testing ground for the ruling had been the 2010 midterm Congressional elections. But with the semi-official start of the presidential election season in Iowa, the influence of super PACs came rushing to the fore. The New York Times chronicled the demise of Newt Gingrich’s campaign in light of the negative attack adds run by Restore Our Future—the multimillion dollar super PAC that backs Mitt Romney and is run by former Romney aides: 
 
 Democrats and Republicans alike have singled out the $2.8 million-and-counting air deluge as the biggest factor in Mr. Gingrich’s precipitous drop in polls of Iowa voters and Mitt Romney’s corresponding rise, reshaping the critical first contest of the Republican primary season to Mr. Romney’s benefit. 
 
 
 
 The ads, which continue to blanket Iowa days before the caucuses here, were created and paid for by people with deep knowledge of the Romney campaign’s strategic thinking, close relationships with Mr. Romney’s most generous donors, and even research on what television viewers like and dislike most about Mr. Romney himself. 
 
 In an article titled “Newt Gingrich Suffers from Super PAC Buyer’s Remorse,” Politico recalled that two years ago Gingrich heralded the Citizens outcome as a “great victory for free speech,” but has now referred to the toll of the Restore Our Future ads as having been “ ‘Romney-boated’ by his chief opponent’s ‘millionaire friends.’ ”: 
 
 Though Gingrich says he still supports the court decision, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, his shift in attitude illustrates the difficulty that the free-wheeling big-money election landscape can pose for politicians—even, and perhaps especially, conservatives who philosophically oppose campaign rules as restrictions on free speech. 
 
 That irony was not lost on Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig, who told Democracy Now that Gingrich reaped a “certain sweet justice” at the polls. Lessig, the author of a new book entitled Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress—and a Plan to Stop It, is also in favor of amending the Constitution to expunge big-money influence on elections.

 Subscribe to Corporate Counsel ||||| Despite the political carnage suffered by Republican presidential candidates at the hands of super PACs in Iowa, conservatives show no signs of buyers’ remorse after supporting the Supreme Court decision that opened the floodgates for the unlimited campaign money that fueled them. 
 
 Tuesday’s Iowa caucuses were the first presidential battleground where the political world got a look at the game changing power of the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision that led to the rise of super PACs. But not even Newt Gingrich, who regularly complained about the pounding he took from a pro-Romney super PAC, was backing off his support for the decision. 
 
 Asked on Wednesday on MSNBC if he had any second thoughts about Citizens United after falling victim to the decision’s unintended consequences, he answered, “No, I’m not the victim of that. I’m the victim of one particular person, Mitt Romney, whose staff went out and decided to run a deliberately negative and dishonest campaign.” 
 
 He continued, “This particular approach, I think, has nothing to do with the Citizens United case, it has to do with

So my brother comes home the other day," Taylor Swift says, "and he goes, 'Oh, my God – I just saw a guy walking down the street with a cat on his head.'" 
 
 As an ardent fan of ready-made metaphors, as well as of cats, Swift was excited by this. "My first reaction was, 'Did you take a picture?'" she says. "And then I thought about it. Half of my brain was going, 'We should be able to take a picture if we want to. That guy is asking for it – he's got a cat on his head!' But the other half was going, 'What if he just wants to walk around with a cat on his head, and not have his picture taken all day?'"

 For Swift – four-time multiplatinum-album-maker, seven-time Grammy winner and billion-time gossip-blog subject – being famous is a lot like walking around with a cat on your head. "I can have issues with it," she says. "But at the end of the day, I can't be ungrateful, because I chose this. But sometimes – sometimes – you don't want to have a camera pointed at you. Sometimes it would be nice if someone just said, 'Hey, I think it's really cool that you have that cat on your head. I think that's interesting.'" 
 
 It's 1300 hours in the San Fernando Valley, and Project Sparrow is in full effect. In a nondescript parking lot at a soundstage in Van Nuys, California, a Blackwater-esque platoon of personal-security professionals stands at the ready. Every doorway and stairwell is guarded, and every window is blacked out. The occasion: a Taylor Swift video shoot.

 In 2014, a Swift shoot requires the kind of operational secrecy and logistical complexity rarely seen outside of a SEAL raid. Before Project Sparrow – the code name chosen by the video's director, Mark Romanek – there was Project Cardinal, a multiweek mission where Swift's social-media team scoured the Web for a representative group of fans to appear in the video. When one girl posted a photo of her invitation, she was quickly uninvited, then presumably renditioned to whatever CIA black site holds Swift's enemies. (Jack Antonoff, of Bleachers and fun., who has recently co-written several songs with Swift, says that "just having her songs on my hard drive makes me feel like I have Russian secrets or something. It's terrifying.") 
 
 At the moment, Swift is in a makeup chair in her dressing room, getting false eyelashes applied. She's wearing a black miniskirt, black tights and a fuzzy pink top with a cartoon drawing of a cat, and her wavy blond hair is pinned back tight. She's five feet 10, but she looks much taller, even with her lanky legs wrapped underneath her like a pretzel twist. "I need lunch like, whoa," Swift says, and an assistant tells her there's a sushi order happening. "Oooh," she purrs. "Get a boatload."

 The video is for Swift's soon-to-be-Number One single, "Shake It Off," which she'll perform for the first time at the VMAs later this summer, but which at this point only a handful of people outside the room even know exists. There are worries about spies and recording devices. "Don't even get me started on wiretaps," Swift says seriously. "It's not a good thing for me to talk about socially. I freak out." As for who might bug a Van Nuys production office on the off chance that Swift is inside: "The janitor," she says, as if naming one candidate among hundreds. "The janitor who's being paid by TMZ. This is gonna sound like I'm a crazy person – but we don't even know. I have to stop myself from thinking about how many aspects of technology I don't understand." 
 
 Swift pauses, as if weighing just how paranoid she's comfortable with sounding. Then she plows ahead. "Like speakers," she says. "Speakers put sound out . . . so can't they take sound in? Or" – she holds up her cellphone – "they can turn this on, right? I'm just saying. We don't even know."
