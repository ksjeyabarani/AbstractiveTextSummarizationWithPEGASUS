||||| Superintendent hopes for re-evaluation of celibacy .
 || Nancy Kotowski said Wednesday that she hopes the revelation this week that she had a long-term relationship with a priest will open a dialogue within the Catholic Church about its clerical celibacy requirements. Kotowski, the Monterey County superintendent of schools, said the "physical aspect" of her long-term relationship with the Rev. Manning, a prominent figure in the church in Southern California, has taken a leave of absence from his ministry after his relationship with Kotowski, his second cousin, was reported by the San Bernardino Sun and published in The Herald on Wednesday. "The reality is that we love the church, we're committed to the church, but I'm hoping a dialogue will open up (about) obligatory celibacy, the whole question of celibacy," she said Wednesday during a telephone interview with The Herald.

I spent all day yesterday doing everything I could to make this story into national news and was prepared this morning to come on and talk about how we needed to work harder to find Nia’s killer, but I am glad to report that at about 6pm West Coast time, John Lee Cowell, a brutal man with a history of violence across his entire life, was arrested and charged with murdering Nia’s murder.  ⁇  I’ve been working on this story for a long time, and I’ve been working on it for a long time, and I’ve been working on it for a long time, and I’ve been working on it for a long time, and I’ve been working on it for a long time, and I’ve been working on it for a long time, and I’ve been working on it for a long time, and I’

The ship was the first ship in history who traveled around Canada and the USA over the north passage and trough the Panama Canal! You will learn a lot about the history of British Columbia and it first European visitors from Spain and later from Britain and France, but also about the First Nation people. I'm normally not a huge museum fan but this one is very unique and focuses mostly on the maritime history of Vancouver and Canada as a whole. There is a lot of stuff about the Northwest Passage and I learned a lot that I never would've learned if I hadn't come to this museum. If you're interested in maritime history or just want a unique take on Vancouver's history, this is a great place to go. I'm not sure if this is a museum or a museum for kids, but it's a great place to learn about the history of Vancouver and Canada.

 While Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have been making the lovey-dovey rounds in support of her new film Salt (next stop, today at Comic-Con!), their attorneys have been working to kill—at least temporarily—another round of bogus breakup rumors. .
 This morning, while the power couple presumably snoozed away in L.A., their lawyers in London accepted an undisclosed settlement (earmarked for charity, of course), from the British tab News of the World for making "false and intrusive allegations." .
