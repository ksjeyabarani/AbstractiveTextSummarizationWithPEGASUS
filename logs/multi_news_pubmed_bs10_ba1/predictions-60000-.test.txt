– Black Americans have the highest rates of hypertension in the world, and they're also more likely to suffer from heart failure, according to a study published in the American Journal of Cardiology. Researchers found that black people with high blood pressure ( hypertension) were 10 times more likely to suffer from heart failure than white people with the same blood pressure. They also had a 10-fold greater risk of dying from the condition, according to a press release. The study found that people with high blood pressure who had a genetic mutation were twice as likely to suffer from heart failure. Researchers believe the condition is caused by a lack of angiotensin II, a hormone that helps blood pressure rise. People with the mutation were also more likely to suffer from high blood pressure-related heart attacks and strokes. The study found that people with the mutation were also more likely to have high blood pressure-related heart attacks and strokes, according to the press release. People with the genetic mutation were also twice as likely to have high blood pressure-related heart attacks and strokes. Researchers believe the condition is caused by a lack of angiotensin II, a hormone that helps blood pressure rise.

– Men who eat a lot of tomatoes have a lower risk of getting prostate cancer, according to a new study. Researchers found that men who ate a lot of tomatoes had a 9% lower risk of getting the disease than those who ate a lot of other foods, reports the New York Times. The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, also found that men who ate a lot of watermelon and pink grapefruit had a 9% lower risk of getting the disease than men who ate a lot of other foods, reports the Los Angeles Times. The researchers say their study is the first to show a link between eating a lot of tomatoes and a lower risk of prostate cancer, but they say more research is needed to confirm the findings.

– A new study suggests that people who've had hepatitis C for a long time may have a harder time fighting the virus than previously thought. Researchers at the University of Illinois looked at more than 1,200 people with chronic hepatitis C who had liver biopsies, and found that those who had persistently normal alanine aminotransferase (Pnalt) levels were far more likely to have advanced liver disease than those who had normal alt levels, reports the New York Times. Normal alt is a measure of how much of the liver enzyme alanine is in the blood, and Pnalt is usually below the upper limit of normal. "It was generally thought that people with Pnalt have a mild liver disease and the degree of liver fibrosis is minimal," says study co-author Zachary Goldfarb. "later on, it was realized that a considerable number of such patients developed significant inflammation and fibrosis over time." The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that those with Pnalt had a score of 30 or higher on at least two of at least three liver biopsies over the course of a year, compared to 19 or higher for those with normal alt. The study's lead author, Goldfarb, tells the Chicago Tribune that the findings suggest that people with

– If you're in need of a blood transfusion and can't find a willing donor, here's something you might want to consider: You're HIV-positive. That's the conclusion of a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that looked at the blood supply in South Africa, which has the highest HIV infection rate in the world at 8.8%. Of the 409 people who received a unit of blood from a South African hospital between December 2009 and December 2010, 8.8% tested positive for HIV, which is spread through contact with infected blood or equipment, reports LiveScience. That's more than three times the global average of 0.6%. "We were surprised by the high HIV infection rate," the study's lead author says in a press release. "We were also surprised to find such a high rate of HIV infection in the blood supply of people who are not HIV positive." That's because South Africa has some of the world's lowest rates of HIV infection, as well as low rates of hepatitis B and C, the two most common viruses in blood transfusions. The study also found that the HIV infection rate among people who'd received a unit of blood from a South African hospital was four times higher than the global average

– Scientists have figured out a way to use artificial intelligence to analyze the DNA of living creatures without having to know their genetic make-up. Reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, say they've figured out a way to query proteins without having to know the particulars of the protein-protein interaction that takes place within each living creature, reports the BBC. "It's like having an AI butler," says one of the researchers. "You don't need to know the DNA of the dog. You don't need to know the DNA of the cat. You don't need to know the DNA of the bird. You just need to know the protein sequence of the bird." The researchers used an algorithm they call "torque" to analyze proteins in the uniprot database, which contains the DNA of more than 10,000 species of living creatures. They found that by matching protein sequences to each other, they could identify living creatures with similar DNA make-up. "It's like having an AI butler," says the lead researcher.

– When a 32-year-old man went to the doctor complaining of 40% alcohol consumption over the past five years, he was given the drug disulfiram, which is used to treat alcohol dependence. But when the patient took the drug twice a day for a month instead of abstaining from alcohol, he developed psychosis, according to a case study published in BMJ Case Reports. The patient had a family history of schizophrenia, and doctors found that his liver function was impaired and he had a history of hepatitis and polyneuritis, which are side effects of disulfiram. "Our case highlights the relevance of a careful history of patient's symptoms and family history that should be performed before starting treatment with disulfiram for patients with personal and familial antecedents of psychosis," the doctors wrote. After the drug was stopped, the man's symptoms improved.

– If you live in Argentina, you may want to stock up on deltamethrin, the world's most widely used insecticide. The compound, which is also known as imidacloprid, has been linked to an increase in the number of bedbugs in the country's capital, Buenos Aires, as well as to an increase in the number of human cases of malaria and other diseases, the BBC reports. In fact, the country's health ministry estimates that more than half of its bedbugs are now resistant to deltamethrin. To test the insecticide's effects on bedbugs, researchers bred bedbugs that were resistant to deltamethrin and then exposed them to it, Phys.org reports. Eight years later, they found no difference in the number of bedbugs that were resistant to deltamethrin when exposed to it compared to those that were susceptible. "This is the first time that deltamethrin has been shown to have an effect on bedbugs," the lead researcher tells the BBC. "It's a major concern because it's such a widely used insecticide, and it's been shown to have an effect on other insect species as well." The researchers say more research is needed to see if the insecticide also has an effect on bedbugs in other parts of the

– Women who suffer a distal radius fracture—the most common type of upper lumbar fracture—have a significantly higher risk of osteoporosis than women who don't, according to a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The bone mineral density (bmd) of 206 postmenopausal Korean women with a distal radius fracture was found to be significantly lower than that of 894 women without a distal radius fracture and 313 women without a distal radius fracture who were in the control group, LiveScience reports. "Our study shows that bone density in postmenopausal Korean women with a distal radius fracture is significantly lower than that of women without a distal radius fracture," the study's lead author says in a press release. "In addition, low bone mineral density is predictive of future 15 years prior to osteoporotic hip and spine fractures." The study found that women with a distal radius fracture who were found to have osteoporosis were more likely to have lower bone mineral density than women without a distal radius fracture who were in the control group, according to the press release. Researchers say that women with a distal radius fracture who were found to have osteoporosis should be evaluated for osteoporosis before having a distal radius fracture. (Another recent study found that women who suffer a distal radius fracture are more likely

– A new study out of Kuwait suggests that a protein called srage may play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes, reports the New York Times. srage is a splice variant of a receptor for advanced glycation end products, or rage, which has been linked to a wide range of diseases, including cancer. Researchers found that mice injected with a form of srage called a soluble version of full-length rage were less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than mice injected with a form of full-length rage called a soluble version of full-length rage. The soluble form of srage is believed to be protective against type 2 diabetes, and the new study suggests that srage may play a role in the development of the disease as well. The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation and involved 158 participants who were screened for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Those with low levels of srage were more likely to develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, while those with high levels of srage were also more likely to develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, according to a press release. "This is the first time that srage has been shown to be a risk factor for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes,"

– If you're one of the 15% to 29% of Americans who suffer from astigmatism after cataract surgery, you may want to think twice about getting another operation. Researchers in Greece say they've successfully used a new type of lens to correct astigmatism in patients who had the surgery a year and a half after it was implanted, the New York Times reports. The acrysof toric iol lens, which was approved by the FDA in 2005, is a single-photon lens that's placed in the middle of the patient's eyes to correct for spherical and astigmatic astigmatism, according to a press release. The acrysof toric iol lens has been found to be more stable than the traditional incisions used to treat astigmatism after cataract surgery, and it's been shown to be more effective than the incisions, researchers say. In a study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, researchers used MRI scans of the patients' eyes after the surgery and found that the acrysof toric iol lens remained in the middle of the patients' eyes for an average of 18 months, compared to 12 months for patients who had a corneal incision used to treat astigmatism before the lens was placed in the middle of the patients' eyes. They also found

– When a 61-year-old Brazilian man went to the doctor complaining of a year of pain in his bladder, he was told he had a rare and aggressive form of bladder cancer, Live Science reports. According to a study published in the British Medical Journal, small cell carcinoma of the bladder is a subtype of urothelial carcinoma, which accounts for less than 1% of all bladder tumors and has a poor prognosis. The man was given four chemotherapy sessions, but the cancer had metastasized, meaning it had spread to other parts of his body. The man died four months after surgery, and doctors report in the study that the best course of treatment was to have the tumor removed as soon as possible. The man's bladder was removed with a "bricker-ileal procedure" that lasted five hours and didn't require blood transfusions, Live Science reports. According to the study, small cell carcinoma of the bladder is the most aggressive type of bladder cancer and presents "the same symptoms and morphology of urothelial carcinoma." The man's cancer had metastasized, meaning it had spread to other parts of his body. The study states that the best course of treatment for this type of bladder cancer is to have it removed as soon as possible

– A rare genetic disorder known as phakomatosis pigmentovascularis (ppv) is causing a 13-year-old girl in Japan to go blind, Live Science reports. According to a case study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the girl had a wine stain on her face, chest, lower leg, and right side of the back as well as a bright blue spot on her eye. The condition is caused by a buildup of pigment in the blood vessels of the eye, brain, and other parts of the body. In this case, the pigment buildup caused a blood clot to form in the girl's eye, which caused the blue spot to form on her eye. The condition is so rare it's not even known there are cases, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. There are four types of ppv, and the girl was diagnosed with two of them—cutis marmorata and mongolian blue spot—as well as klippel- trenaunay syndrome, which is caused by a buildup of pigment in the blood vessels of the eye, brain, and other parts of the body, Live Science reports. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the condition is caused by a genetic mutation that makes the girl'

– A new study raises the possibility that a common virus may play a role in the development of one of the most common forms of brain cancer. Researchers say they've found the DNA of the human polyomavirus in the brains of patients who died of medulloblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer, reports the New York Times. It's the first time the virus has been found in the brain of patients who died of medulloblastoma, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The polyomavirus is present in both normal and medulloblastoma brains and is known to promote the growth of tumors. The researchers say the presence of the virus in the brain could be a sign that it's behind the growth of the cancer, or it could be that the virus promotes the growth of medulloblastoma. They caution, however, that more research is needed and that the presence of the virus in the brain isn't necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship. The researchers say they've also found the DNA of another virus, brucella, in the brains of patients who died of medulloblastoma and brains of patients who died of other cancers. The presence of the virus in the brain could be a sign that

– A common over-the-counter ointment is helping to keep antibiotic-resistant "superbugs" at bay, according to researchers at the University of North Carolina. They tested bensal hp, a combination of salicylic acid, benzoic acid, and polyethylene glycol, on 184 bacterial and fungal isolates from around the world, including MRSA and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, which are now resistant to common antibiotics, the researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The presence of bensal hp on the skin proved effective against a range of bacteria and fungi, including candida albicans, cryptococcus fortuitum, trichophyton rubrum, and t mentagrophytes. "This is the first time that topical agents have been shown to be effective against organisms that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics," the lead researcher says in a press release. The ointment was also found to be effective against yeasts and fungi, according to the researchers, who say it could be an important tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance. "Bensal hp has the potential to be an important new tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance," the researcher says. "It's a common over-the-counter ointment, and it's

– If you're a professional athlete who can't shake the feeling in your hip that your hip is hurting, you may want to consider having surgery. That's according to a new study published in the British Medical Journal that looked at the cases of 45 athletes who suffered from what's known as femoral labral impingement, or fai. The condition occurs when the acetabulum (the part of the femur that connects the pelvis to the hip) and the femoral neck (the part of the femur that moves the knee upward) come together to cause damage to the cartilage in the chondrolabral (the part of the hip that moves the knee backward) joint, according to a press release. The condition can be caused by a variety of things, but the most common one is a "mixed cam and pincer pathology," in which both parts of the femur come together to cause damage, Popular Science reports. The researchers found that only five of the athletes who had fai had the condition treated for at least six weeks, which they figured would be enough time for further damage to the cartilage to occur and for the femoral neck to return to its normal shape. Instead, they had surgery, which involved drilling the acetabulum into the

– A new study has found that one in five kids under the age of 5 in Iran is malnourished—and that's a huge problem, LiveScience reports. The study looked at 885 kids in southern Iran, and found that 35.8% were underweight, 42.7% were stunted, and 9.2% were wasted, according to a press release. The kids were measured using a scale that measured their height, weight, and body mass index. The researchers found that 1 in 4 were overweight, and 1 in 5 were obese. "Malnutrition is one of the most important causes for improper physical and mental development of children," says one of the researchers. "One in every five children in the developing world is malnourished."

– A rare genetic disorder known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf-1), which affects one in 2,500 people, has been found in a 5-year-old Italian boy, Live Science reports. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the condition causes an extra calvarial nerve sheath to form in the brain's occipital bone. The occipital bone is where the trigeminal nerve passes from the forehead to the neck. The condition has been found in only nine other people in the world, according to a press release. The boy, who had painless cervical swelling since birth, had to have his skull and brain removed. Doctors found nf-1 in the boy's brain, skull bone, and occipital bone. They believe the condition is caused by mutations in the nf-1 gene. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, nf-1 is 10% to 20% rare, accounting for one case in 36,00080,000 people.

– When a 59-year-old woman went to the doctor with a large, black lesion on her right breast, doctors weren't sure what to make of it. But after an incisional biopsy, they discovered the tumor was a melanoma—the most common form of breast cancer in women, according to the American Cancer Society—and it had spread to her lymph nodes, the New York Times reports. The woman is now cancer-free three years after the surgery, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. "This is the first case of metastatic melanoma of the breast that we have seen in the West," the study's lead author tells the Times. According to the study, the woman's melanoma was located in the upper inner quadrant of her right breast, which is "not associated with any breast mass." The skin lesion had been growing rapidly and bleeding since it was born, according to the study. After the woman went to the doctor, doctors discovered the tumor was a melanoma that had spread to her lymph nodes. Doctors removed the woman's normal skin and subcutaneous tissue to make sure there was no spread of the tumor, as well as the lymph node, which was not palpated, according to the study. The woman was

– Scientists are reporting in the journal Nature Communications that they've successfully manipulated radiation to alter the human genome in a way that could one day help fight cancer. Reporting in the journal Scientific Reports, they say that by altering the DNA of keratinocytes, cells that produce hair, they were able to alter the human genome in such a way that it differed from that of healthy cells. The keratinocytes were then exposed to high doses of radiation for up to six hours. The researchers say that by altering the DNA of the cells, they were able to alter the genome in such a way that it differed from that of healthy cells. The hope is that by altering the genome in such a way, it could one day be used to fight cancer, reports LiveScience.

– There's a new way to diagnose a painful joint infection, and it doesn't require a trip to the emergency room. Instead, doctors can simply order a blood test to reveal the presence of the infection, known as periprosthetic joint infection, or pji, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Previously, doctors could only test for inflammatory factors of white blood cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum c-reactive protein, all of which can reveal the presence of pji, according to a press release. But the blood test that's been most commonly used to diagnose pji—which can lead to permanent deformity or even loss of an implant—is more sensitive and specific than the serum test, which has long been the standard method for diagnosis, researchers say. "Our study shows that the blood test can detect pji much more quickly and accurately than the serum test," the study's lead author, Dr. Supat Thammasitboon, says in the press release. Previous research has shown that the protein c-reactive protein (crp) in synovial fluid—the joint fluid that hosts the bacteria that cause pji—is a good indicator of pji, but there's

– Eighteen months after a 17-year-old girl underwent a course of chemotherapy for leukemia, she developed a nasty infection that perforated the cornea of her right eye, the New York Times reports. The girl's mother tells the Times that her daughter had developed the infection, known as preseptal cellulitis, when she was younger. The preseptal cellulitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi; in this case, it appears to have been brought on by the girl's immune system, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study's authors note that preseptal cellulitis has previously been seen in immunocompromised patients, but this is the first time such an infection has been reported in a patient receiving systemic chemotherapy for leukemia. The study's authors say the girl's immune system probably didn't recognize the preseptal cellulitis as an infection and didn't attack the cornea until it was too late. Seven months after the girl's surgery, she had vision in her right eye back to normal, but the preseptal cellulitis continued to interfere with her vision.

– If you've ever wanted a natural-looking tooth that looks and feels just like yours, you're in luck: Scientists say they've figured out how to make a composite restoration look and feel just like yours, without damaging the tooth, the New York Times reports. The trick, according to a study published in Science Advances, is to add a solvent to the bonding agent used to create a thin layer of material around the tooth. The problem is that too much of one of the solvents (e.g., acetone) can hurt the bonding agent's ability to polymerization, according to a press release. The trick, according to the researchers, is to add a solvent that's just right for the job. In this case, it's ethanol, Phys.org reports. Scientists used an ultrasound machine on teeth that had been etched with 35% phosphoric acid gel, then rinsed and dried. They found that the higher the concentration of ethanol in the solution, the better the bonding agent was at preventing water from leaking between the tooth's enamel and dentin, which is what leads to decay and necrosis of the pulp, the Times notes. The researchers also found that the higher the concentration of ethanol, the better the bond was at preventing water from

– Scientists have cloned a human gene that may play a key role in the development of autoimmune diseases, the BBC reports. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign cloned a copy of the hnrnp a2/b1 gene, which is involved in the transport of ribonucleoproteins (RMPs) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, according to a press release. RMPs are known to trigger an immune response in the body, but no one had previously cloned a hnrnp b2 gene, which is involved in the transport of RMPs and may play a key role in the development of diseases such as celiac disease and multiple sclerosis. "Our study shows for the first time that a hnrnp b2 gene is involved in the transport of RMPs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which is a major step forward in our understanding of how RMPs are involved in the autoimmunity process," the study's lead author says in the press release. The cloned hnrnp b2 gene was found to be similar to another RMP, hnrnp a1, which was also involved in the transport of RMPs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but didn't play a role in

– A new study has identified a gene that confers resistance to a class of antibiotics known as macrolides, NBC News reports. Researchers at the University of Washington identified the gene, known as vga(a)lc, in the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, according to a press release. vga(a)lc confers resistance to lincosamides, streptogramin b, pleuromutilins, and oxazolidinones but not macrolides. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, says it's the first time a gene has been identified that confers resistance to a class of antibiotics. Researchers believe vga(a)lc is unique in that it confers resistance to all three macrolides, as well as to at least two other classes of antibiotics, lincosamides and streptogramin b. But it's not clear whether it's the same gene that confers resistance to tetracyclines, one of the first classes of antibiotics, according to the Washington Post. Researchers say they hope to use vga(a)lc as a starting point to develop new antibiotics.

– After a leukemia diagnosis, a 51-year-old man underwent a seven-day course of chemotherapy that didn't produce any remissions. Then, on the seventh day, he developed neutropenic fever, a skin condition known as fungaemia. A blood test confirmed the presence of a rare yeast infection called pseudozyma aphidis fungaemia. It's believed to be the first known case of its kind in a human, reports the New York Times. Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say the fungus was found in the man's lung after he had participated in a clinical trial using the anti-malaria drug fluconazole instead of the standard anti-malaria drug pconazole. They say the patient was treated with the anti-malaria drug caspofungin instead of fluconazole, and the yeast infection was treated with the anti-malaria drugteicoplanin, which was added after the blood test confirmed the presence of the yeast infection. The man died on the eighth day of treatment. "This is the first time we've seen a case of pseudozyma aphidis fungaemia in a leukemia patient," one of the researchers tells the Times.

– A new study out of the Middle East suggests that people with end-stage renal disease who are also diabetic have a higher risk of developing a condition known as diabetic foot ulcers. The ulcers, which can lead to amputations, can be caused by a buildup of plaque in the feet, the New York Times reports. The condition has been linked to a higher rate of amputations in people with end-stage renal disease, who are receiving kidney dialysis, according to a press release. In a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers looked at more than 5,600 hemodialysis patients in Qatar who were alive five years after receiving the dialysis. They found that those with the ulcers were 10 times more likely to die during the study than those without the ulcers. The researchers believe the ulcers are caused by a buildup of plaque in the feet, according to the press release. The study's lead author, Dr. Nasser al-Shaalan, tells the Times that people with end-stage renal disease have a higher risk of peripheral arterial disease and peripheral neuropathy, which can lead to ulcers, than people with Type 2 diabetes. He adds that people with the ulcers are also more likely to have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and more. According to the study,

– A heart condition known as primary cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of death from heart disease in the US, and it's caused by mutations in a gene called scn5a. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, mutations in the gene—which encodes the alpha subunit of the major sodium channel in the heart—have been found in at least 40 disease genes and are associated with a variety of conditions, including atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, sudden infant death syndrome, and atrial fibrillation. A1180v, a single nucleotide mutation that occurred in 20 of the gene's exons, was found in a three-generation Chinese family, and in six younger unaffected members of the family, in 2008, according to a press release. Researchers found a1180v was present in 6.2% of the family members they studied, which they say is "inconsistent with our previous observations" and "suggests that a1180v is a common variant in asians, which is inconsistent with our previous observations." They followed up the family for six years, during which time they interviewed all family members with symptoms of cardiovascular disease, including chest pain, palpitation, cyanosis, and syncope. They found a1180v

– When a 70-year-old man showed up at a British hospital complaining of blurry vision for six weeks, doctors decided he had a rare eye condition called pseudophakic inferotemporal macula detachment. They performed a biomicroscopy on the patient and discovered the detachment, which was causing the part of the eye responsible for looking at images, to be "off" instead of "on," according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study's lead author tells the BBC that such detachments are rare, occurring in just 1% to 3% of people over the age of 50, but they can lead to serious problems if left untreated. "The main concern is the conversion to a macula—off situation which has a much poorer visual prognosis," he says. In this case, doctors were able to repair the detachment in just five days using a new technique called spectral domain optical coherence tomography, which "offers a noninvasive tool to evaluate retinal microstructural changes in a number of eye pathologies," the researchers say in a press release. The scan revealed the detachment was caused by a cyst that had formed near the fovea—the part of the eye responsible for looking at images—but no retinal folds or hyperreflectivity were seen, according to the

– The human eye lens is made up of approximately 35% of its soluble mass in proteins called crystallins, which are found almost exclusively in the lens itself and are composed of a 3:1 ratio of a to b. Almost exclusively in the lens, b has been found throughout the body, including the heart, muscle, kidney, lung, and skin cells. Now researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they've discovered a third subgroup of crystallins, which are composed of a 3:1 ratio of a to b and are also found almost exclusively in the lens, and that they believe they've figured out a way to interfere with the protein's function and protect the lens from damage. "The lens therefore provides a unique opportunity to observe the effects of aging in relation to damage accumulation," they write. The researchers found that by altering the crystallins' activity, they were able to prevent the proteins from turning into water, which in turn causes them to accumulate in the lens, which in turn leads to the formation of cataracts. They also found that by altering the crystallins' activity, they were able to prevent a third subgroup of crystallins, which are composed of a 3:1 ratio of a to b and are found almost exclusively in the

– Women who are obese are more likely to have high blood pressure, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes, according to a new study out of South Korea. Researchers found that obese women who had high blood pressure were twice as likely to have a heart attack or stroke in the next five years as women who were not obese, the New York Times reports. The study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, also found that the more obese the woman was, the more likely she was to have "epicardial fat," which is related to fat in the body and is known to be associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, according to a press release. "Obesity is a worldwide phenomenon, with an incidence increasing in parallel with obesity—associated diseases such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension," the researchers write. "Although body mass index is associated with the severity of ambulatory hypertension and an increase in daytime blood pressure, bmi does not reflect body fat," they explain. "epicardial fat tissue is related to visceral fat, rather than total adiposity, and shares microcirculation with visceral tissue and coronary vessels." The study looked at more than 4,000 South Korean women over the age of 50 who had been diagnosed with high blood pressure or

– Someday, you may be able to buy a 3D-printed tooth that looks a lot like your own. Or at least that's what a new study suggests. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh say they've figured out how to make a 3D-printed tooth that looks a lot like a real tooth, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. The researchers used a process known as additive manufacturing, which involves using 3D technology to create a "3D model" of a patient's oral cavity. The model is then "cut to the desired shape and size" by a laser, according to a press release. The result is a 3D-printed tooth that looks a lot like a real tooth, even if it's only a fraction of the size of a real tooth, the Post-Gazette notes. In a study published in the Journal of Periodontology, the researchers compared a 3D-printed tooth that looked like a real tooth to a 3D-printed tooth that looked like a real tooth and found no difference, the Post-Gazette reports. "This is the first time a 3D-printed dental prosthesis has been shown to be as good as a real tooth in terms of function and aesthetics," the lead researcher tells the Post-Gazette

In a case study published in the American Journal of Internal Medicine, doctors say a 19-year-old woman was diagnosed with the condition, in which hair gets caught in combs and brushes and breaks away, Live Science reports. "This may be spontaneous or secondary to mechanical factors like vigorous scratching or combing the hair," the doctors write. The woman had curly, dry hair up to the nape of the neck and no history of cosmetic use or parlor activities for hair care, according to the study. trichonodosis is caused by "scratching, combing, washing, or friction," the doctors write. "If the knots are pulled excessively tight, transverse splintering of the hair shaft and simulation of trichorrhexis nodosa may result."

– A drug used to treat multiple sclerosis may do more than just slow the progression of the disease: It may also cause heart failure, according to a new study. The drug, mitoxantrone, was approved by the FDA in 2003 for the treatment of patients with worsening multiple sclerosis who had failed at least one other treatment, the New York Times reports. Since then, more than 200 patients have suffered heart attacks or strokes after taking low-dose infusions of mitoxantrone, according to a press release. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers looked at 30 patients with multiple sclerosis who had received low-dose infusions of mitoxantrone for at least three months and then repeated the infusions for at least three months. There were no major heart attacks or strokes after receiving low-dose infusions of mitoxantrone, according to the study. However, researchers found that three of 30 patients experienced an acute episode of relapsing multiple sclerosis after receiving low-dose infusions of mitoxantrone. They also found that three of 30 patients suffered from depression after receiving low-dose infusions of mitoxantrone.

– Scientists have discovered a potential new way to treat some of the world's most common diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple cancers of the heart, liver, and lung, the BBC reports. According to a study published Wednesday in Nature Communications, a gene called pr2a regulates the body's production of the threonine protein, which is key to the body's ability to create new cells. When pr2a is turned on, the body produces more threonine and less threonine, the Telegraph reports. When it's turned off, the body doesn't have the threonine it needs to create new cells. That's why, according to a press release, people with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple cancers of the heart, liver, and lung—including breast, thyroid, and colon cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma—have an unusually high risk of dying from a lack of threonine. Researchers believe they've figured out a way to turn pr2a back on, thus preventing the body from turning on its own threonine protein, the Telegraph reports. According to the press release, researchers believe they've also found a way to turn

– People who suffer from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) might want to stock up on vitamin d. A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that those who took vitamin d supplements had a 30% lower risk of dying from the liver disease than those who took a placebo, Live Science reports. The study's lead author, Dr. Ali Rezai, tells the New York Times that vitamin d boosts the body's ability to clear fat from the liver, which in turn causes an increase in inflammation. Previous research has shown a link between vitamin d and liver disease, but there was no evidence of a link between vitamin d and liver disease severity, according to a press release. In this study, Rezai's team split 60 patients with nafld into two groups. The first group took vitamin d pills every week for 10 weeks, while the second group took a placebo. At the end of the study, there was a 30% lower risk of death in the vitamin d group than in the placebo group. But researchers say more research is needed to confirm the study's results, the Times reports. (NAFLD is linked to diabetes and heart disease.)

– Men who suffer from benign prostatic hyperplasia, an enlarged prostate that can lead to urinary problems, erectile dysfunction, and even cancer, can turn to laser surgery to remove it, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The "gold standard" of benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery is transurethral resection of the prostate, or turp, which requires a total of 50 to 100 patients to complete, according to a press release. But the learning curve for turp is as high as 50 to 100 cases, which has led to a dramatic decrease in the number of such surgeries being performed annually. In this study, researchers compared the results of the newer laser surgery, known as ktp, to standard turp and found it to be as safe and effective as turp. The researchers performed ktp on 532 men over a 10-year period with a mortality rate of 11.1%, compared to 5.2% with standard turp. They also found ktp was as safe and effective as turp when used on men with an average age of 53, LiveScience reports.

– When a 66-year-old man came to the hospital complaining of shortness of breath and abdominal pain in 2012, he was diagnosed with dyspnea—a common symptom of myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow disorder. But when his chest CT scan didn't find any abnormalities, doctors decided to take a closer look at the man's lungs, reports Live Science. What they found: an extramedullary hematopoiesis, an abnormal buildup of white blood cells in the lungs that can lead to hypertension. The condition can occur after liver and bone marrow transplants, chemotherapy, or other treatments for myelofibrosis, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In this case, the extramedullary hematopoiesis was found to be present in the man's liver, spleen, and pleura. "It's a very unusual finding," the study's lead author says in a press release. "It's also very unusual to have it in the lungs." The man, who had been hospitalized multiple times for dyspnea over the last two years, was treated with a blood thinner and radiation, but doctors found that the condition had returned. The man is one of only a handful of people ever

– Scientists have discovered a potential new way to stop cancer cells from taking over your body, according to a study published Wednesday in Nature Communications. During the body's " mitotic phase" of the cell cycle, a faulty protein called dsbs wreaks havoc on the body's DNA, causing cancer cells to take over and spread throughout the body, according to a press release. Researchers found that a drug called etoposide, which blocks dsbs, stops cancer cells from taking over and spreading, the New York Times reports. "This is the first time we've been able to show that a drug can stop a cell from taking over," study co-author Dr. Orthwein says in the press release. The drug is currently being tested on cancer patients, but it could also be used to stop the spread of other types of cancer. According to the study, it's the first time a drug has been shown to stop cancer cells from taking over the body. Researchers believe it could also be used to stop the spread of other types of cancer, according to the Times. Researchers believe the drug could also be used to stop the spread of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.

– It's one of the most common cancers of the mouth, but doctors say they've never seen a case like this one. A 48-year-old man in Spain was diagnosed with oral malignant melanoma after complaining of pain and swelling in his upper right gums, according to a report in the British Medical Journal. A CT scan revealed the tumor, which had spread from the gingiva to the hard palate, but doctors couldn't determine where it was located. They referred the patient to a cancer clinic, where an incision was made in the man's jaw and the tumor was removed using a titanium mesh graft, Live Science reports. The patient is now cancer-free 11 months after the surgery. "This is the first time we have seen a case of oral malignant melanoma with no sequel," the lead author of the report says in a press release. "The survival rate for this form of oral cancer is less than 15%, which is one of the lowest survival rates for other cancers of the mouth." It's extremely rare, occurring between 30 and 90 years of age, with a mean age of 56, and occurs when uncontrolled growth of melanocytes—pigmented cells in the basal layer of oral membrane—is found, according to the report.

– Cat owners may soon be able to skip the shots that blind their beloved felines: Scientists say they've found a way to alter a cat's own stem cells to protect them from macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in cats and a leading cause of blindness in humans, the BBC reports. The researchers, whose study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, say they injected a type of white blood cells known as T-cells into the retinas of cats and mice that had been damaged by macular degeneration. The T-cells, which had been taken from a cat's bone marrow, then formed new cells in the retinas of the mice and rats, according to a press release. The T-cells were then able to form new retinal cells, which kept the mice's macular degeneration at bay, the researchers say. "This is the first time we've been able to show that a cat's own stem cells can be used to fight a disease in humans," the lead researcher tells the BBC. "It's a huge breakthrough." He says the procedure could be used to treat humans with macular degeneration in the future.

– When a 71-year-old man went to the hospital with "dilative cardiomiopathy" and elevated red blood cells, doctors decided to take a closer look at his liver. What they found was a rare condition called biliary hamartoma, which is a benign congenital malformation of the biliary duct, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The man's condition is so rare that it's called the von mayenburg complex, which is also known as vmcs, according to a press release. In this case, doctors used an ultrasound to show the man's cysts, which were surrounded by fibrous stroma. After six months of follow-up tests, doctors determined the man had biliary hamartoma, which is caused by a buildup of fat in the bile ducts, the New England Journal of Medicine reports. According to the study, the man's tumors were so small that they appeared to be coming from a single organ, the liver. "This is the first time we have seen such a benign condition in the liver," the study's lead author tells the New York Daily News. " biliary hamartomas are very rare." The man is now recovering.

– In Brazil, same-sex marriage is illegal and punishable by up to 14 years in prison, but the country's president recently signed a bill into law that will allow same-sex couples to wed, the New York Times reports. It's the first time such a law has been signed by a president in Latin America, and it gives President Dilma Rousseff—who opposes same-sex marriage—an opportunity to make good on a campaign promise. The law will allow same-sex couples to marry as long as they don't have a criminal record, have no children, and don't use drugs or alcohol, among other things. It's not clear how many same-sex couples will actually marry under the new law, but Rousseff says he wants to give same-sex couples the same legal protections as heterosexual ones. "I want to give them the same rights as heterosexuals," he says. The law will also give same-sex couples the same legal protections as heterosexuals, such as the right to marry and to receive health care, the Times notes. But gay rights advocates say the law is just the latest example of discrimination against gays and lesbians in

– If you're over the age of 65 and living in a nursing home, you may want to steer clear of beer. That's according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine that looked at nursing homes across the US and found that nearly half of the patients admitted there didn't take their prescribed medication, and four patients who didn't take their medication at all ended up with dementia. The study's lead author, Dr. Noelle LoConte, tells the New York Times that the problem isn't that nursing homes are overprescribing drugs—it's that they're overprescribing the wrong drugs, or over-prescribing the wrong classes of drugs, or even over-prescribing the wrong medication for the wrong reasons. The study found that 45.6% of patients in nursing homes who didn't take their medication were reported to have adverse effects, which can include everything from memory loss to heart attacks and strokes. LoConte tells the Times that the problem isn't limited to nursing homes, and that "there's a lot of nursing homes that are overprescribing and over-prescribing and over-prescribing and over-prescribing and over-prescribing and over-prescribing and over-

– A 4-year-old boy in India is in critical condition after suffering a massive blood clot in his abdomen, and doctors are now trying to figure out what to do about it. The clot, known as extrahepatic portal venous obstruction or ehpvo, is a common cause of bleeding in the gastrointestinal system and is the No. 2 cause of fatal bleeding in adults, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Most children and adults with ehpvo have normal liver function, but the clot prevents blood from flowing to the abdomen's portal vein, which is responsible for delivering blood to the small intestines, reports the New York Times. If left untreated, the clot can cause massive bleeding that can lead to organ failure and death. Doctors are now trying to figure out what to do about the boy's clot, which was spotted by an ultrasound machine during a routine checkup at a children's hospital in New Delhi, reports the Times. The boy's parents were told to take him to a hospital in the city to be checked out, and doctors discovered the clot had developed during a routine check of the 4-year-old's abdomen. They decided to try to diagnose the clot by taking a blood sample from the boy and

– When a 50-year-old man in New York City went to the hospital complaining of chest pains, doctors thought they'd found the source of his heart trouble: a leaky mitral valve. But when they opened the man's heart up to look for the problem, they found no sign of it, reports Live Science. Instead, they inserted two balloons into the man's body and inflated them, reports the New York Times. The result: The man's heart rate dropped, his blood pressure dropped, and he went into a coma. The doctors report in the New England Journal of Medicine that the patient, who had been diagnosed with arheumatic heart disease, is the first one they've ever treated for this condition, which causes the mitral valve to close improperly. It's not clear why the man's heart rate dropped, but it's possible it was due to a buildup of blood in the pericardium, where the man's heart is located. After the balloon procedure, the man's heart rate again dropped and he went into a coma. He woke up and was able to walk, talk, and eat again. It's not clear whether he'll ever walk again, but doctors say the case shows the importance of

– If you're a woman in the United Arab Emirates, your chances of developing metabolic syndrome are higher than that of a man, according to a new study. The condition, which doubles the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is characterized by elevated levels of fat in the body, particularly around the abdomen, according to a press release. In the study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers looked at 29 healthy men and women between the ages of 29 and 61 and found that the risk of developing the condition was 15% higher for women and 18% higher for men in the country, which is ranked by the World Health Organization as one of the highest in the world for prevalence of the condition. The study doesn't explain the disparity, but researchers say gender differences in fat accumulation and the function of adipose tissue may play a role. The study's lead author, Dr. Nasser al-Attiya, tells the BBC that the condition is prevalent in the Middle East because of "a lack of access to health care, a poor diet, and a lack of physical activity." He adds that the condition is also prevalent among women in the United Arab Emirates because they are more likely to be obese than men. (Men in the United Arab Emirates are

– When it comes to writing prescriptions, medical students often have a hard time keeping track of all the details. So researchers at Indiana University Bloomington set out to remedy that by having students write prescriptions for actual patients, a practice they call "patient-based teaching." They had two groups of 25 medical students each write prescriptions for five real patients—apeptic ulcer, bronchial asthma, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus—over a two-day period. The control group wrote prescriptions for the same five conditions. The students in the "patient-based teaching" group scored an average of 14 points higher than their counterparts in the "non-patient-based teaching" group when it came to writing prescriptions for the actual patients. "This intervention may improve prescribing skills since the learning occurs within the context of real patients and is easier to recall," the researchers write in the Journal of the American College of Physicians. It's not the first study to use patient-based teaching to improve medical students' prescription-writing skills, but it's the first to use actual patients as guinea pigs. The researchers say that by having students write prescriptions for real patients, they were able to better prepare themselves for the real world and gain insight into the principles of clinical pharmacology.

– Tuberculosis isn't just contagious, it can spread through the air, according to researchers who say they've identified the source of an outbreak of the disease in Washington state. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they traced the outbreak to a cluster of drug users in Seattle's Beacon Hill neighborhood, reports the Seattle Times. They found that among the eight patients who contracted the disease between 2003 and 2004, five were born in Africa and one was a white woman who received illicit drugs from one of the patients. Researchers say they identified the source of the outbreak by looking for people who slept in the same apartment as one of the patients and were regularly seen "hotboxing"—smoking marijuana with others in a vehicle with the windows closed—among the friends of those who contracted the disease. They found that the risk of the disease spreading through the air was 2.8 times higher among friends than among others, reports LiveScience, which notes that the researchers say it's not clear whether the drug use played a role in the outbreak.

– A potentially deadly drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus has made its way to Malaysia's largest hospital, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Themethicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or hvisa, is resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin, which is used to treat 80% of infections in Malaysia, according to a press release. The study found that seven out of eight strains of hvisa found in the hospital were resistant to vancomycin, making it the first time the drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus has been found in a Malaysian hospital, the New York Times reports. "This is a worrying development," the study's lead author tells the Times. "We need to be on the lookout for these drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains." The study found that patients who had been treated with vancomycin were far more likely to die from the infection than patients who hadn't been, according to the press release.

– A 70-year-old woman who took the diabetes drugvildagliptin wasn't having a great time, and doctors are now warning other patients to be on the lookout for side effects. The woman, who had Type 2 diabetes and was on dialysis for end-stage renal disease, began taking 50mg of the drug twice a day in 2011, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A year and a half later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, and doctors discovered that the drug had triggered an immune response in her body that caused tumors to form in her lungs, LiveScience reports. The woman had no pets, was not a smoker, and had no experience traveling overseas or allergies to drugs or foods, according to researchers, who say it's the first known case of the drug triggering an immune response in a patient. After stopping the drug, doctors found that the woman's tumors had increased in size and were barely detectable on a lung cancer screening, according to a press release. They also found that the woman's immune system had attacked cells in her lung, causing them to grow uncontrollably and in some cases kill her, according to the study.

– When an 86-year-old Brazilian woman began vomiting and had trouble swallowing, doctors suspected she had an aortic aneurysm, the world's largest body of blood vessels that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. But when she was admitted to the hospital three days ago with stomach pains, nausea, and difficulty swallowing, doctors discovered the aneurysm was in her right side, not her left, according to a report in the British Medical Journal. The woman's symptoms were similar to those of people who have an aortic aneurysm, "but the compression on the right side of the aorta is much more severe," the lead author of the report says in a press release. Doctors removed the aneurysm, which is about the size of a sesame seed, and the woman is expected to make a full recovery.

– If you've ever fallen from a height and suffered a traumatic injury to your liver, spleen, kidney, intestines, stomach, or urinary bladder, you may want to think twice about going under the knife. A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine finds that patients who undergo a less-invasive surgery called " laparoscopy" are far more likely to survive, the BBC reports. Laparoscopic surgery involves cutting a small opening in the patient's abdomen and using a tube to drain blood from the injured organ. "The advent and development of new techniques like laparoscopy minimally invasive surgery (mis) have a diagnostic as well as definitive therapeutic role in bta," the study's lead author says in a press release. " advanced laparoscopy techniques include bowel resection and anastomosis, ligation of blood vessels can be as efficiently utilized in bta as an elective open surgery." In the study, 25 adult patients of either sex who'd suffered a traumatic organ injury were admitted to a hospital in India with stable vitals and injuries to the liver, spleen, kidney, intestines, stomach, pancreas, urinary bladder, and vessels. After three units of whole blood transfusion and an extradural haemorrhage or hematoma (subdural haemorrhage

– A cancer drug that causes liver damage, hepatic damage, and other side effects is still banned in the US—but researchers in India say they've figured out a way to deliver it directly to the skin. The technique, which involves using an electric current to delivermethotrexate to the skin, is called transdermal drug delivery and has previously worked on animals, the BBC reports.methotrexate is an antineoplastic agent that's used to treat cancer, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis, but it's still banned in the US because of the side effects it causes. Researchers used a technique known as iontophoresis to delivermethotrexate directly to the skin. The current uses an electrode of the same polarity as the charge on the drug, which causes ionic drug molecules to enter the body through the skin, according to a press release. The patches are made of a hydrogel that's packed with iontophoresis and allows the drug to be delivered either in solution formulation or through loading on to the patches. So far, no human trials have been done, but researchers hope to begin clinical trials soon.

– If you're one of the millions of people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, it might be time to get moving. A study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that people with the chronic, autoimmune disease are up to five times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than the general population, reports the New York Times. Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive disease that causes a buildup of proinflammatory cytokines in the joint, which can lead to joint damage and, in some cases, death. The study's lead author, Dr. Andrew Mente, tells the Times that exercise can help ease the pain of the disease and improve the quality of life of those who suffer from it. "It's not a question of 'if, but when,'" he says. "It's a question of when, and if you can do it, and if you can do it well, and if you can do it for as long as you can." Mente says that while the study doesn't prove causation, a meta-analysis of 24 studies that looked at 111,758 patients with 22,927 cardiovascular events found that people with rheumatoid arthritis are up to 50% more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than the general population.

– Want to lose weight but can't kick your sugar habit? Try cutting out high- fructose corn syrup and other sugary foods and drinks. That's according to a new study out of the University of Southern California published in the American Journal of Physiology: Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology. The researchers found that people who ate a diet high in fructose had a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, reports the Los Angeles Times.  fructose is found in a wide range of foods and drinks, including soda, fruit juice, breakfast cereals, candy, and sports drinks. "Most of fructose intake in diets originates from sucrose ( containing 50 % fructose and 50 % glucose), and soft drinks containing high - fructose corn syrup ( hfcs)," the study's lead author says in a press release. "The estimate of the consumption of hfcs from beverages indicates a daily range between 132 and 316 kcal for Americans aged over 2 years, and patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld) consume twofold more calories from hfcs from beverages than healthy patients ( 365 vs. 170 kcal / day)."

– If you've ever dreamed of getting your teeth stretched so that they look like they're straight out of a movie, well, you're not the only one. New research out of the University of California, Berkeley, suggests that a device that causes muscles to contract could also change their molecular makeup, reports the Los Angeles Times. The device, which is similar in concept to an appliance used for orthodontic treatment, stretches muscle fibers by binding to a protein called myosin heavy chain and causing them to turn from fast to slow, explains a post at Phys.org. It's not clear, however, whether this is the same thing that happens when a person's leg muscles are stretched. In the study published in the journal Cell Reports, researchers used a device called a "passive stretch appliance" that causes muscles to contract by binding to a protein called myosin heavy chain. They stretched the teeth of rabbits and found that after two weeks, the animals' muscle fibers changed in a way similar to what happens when a person's leg muscles are stretched. The device was then used to stretch the teeth of a control group and five rabbits that had been sedated with the drug ketamine and then allowed to rest for two weeks.

– Meningiomas, the most common type of brain tumor, are often found in older people—and now researchers in South Korea say they've identified one in every 100 people, LiveScience reports. "This is the first time we've found one in every 100 people," study co-author Hwa-Min Kim says in a press release. The condition is so common, in fact, that the World Health Organization has classified it as a type of cancer known as leiomyosarcoma. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at 100 patients who had their meningiomas surgically removed between 2003 and 2012. Of the patients, 23 were meningothelial types, 12 were transitional types, 16 were fibrous types, and one was angiomatous. Of those, five had bone soft tissue invasion and one had brain invasion, according to the study. LiveScience notes that this is the first time a meningioma has been found in every 100 people, but it's not the first time it's been found in older people. In fact, it's the first time a meningioma has been found in people under the age of 50. Researchers say they're not sure why this is the case

– When a 14-year-old boy in the Philippines developed a rash covering his face, neck, and upper limbs, doctors thought it was a common skin condition known as maculopapular eruption. Instead, it turned out to be a rare form of AIDS. The boy, who'd been infected with the HIV virus since age 8, was one of four children in the country diagnosed with maculopapular eruption between 2005 and 2011, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's believed to be the first known case of AIDS caused by an outbreak of maculopapular eruption on the skin, reports the New York Times. All four children had no family history of skin disease, no history of sexual intercourse, and no history of antiretroviral therapy, which fights the virus. The outbreaks of maculopapular eruption have been documented before, but this is the first time it's been seen on the skin of an HIV-infected child, according to the study. It's also the first time the disease has been found on the skin of a child with no history of sexual intercourse. The study's lead author, Dr. Supat Thammasitboon, tells the Times that the presence of the outbreak on the skin

– If you've got a lot of blood on your hands, you may want to store it in a freezer for as long as 30 days. That's according to a new study that looked at 17 types of analytes—including cholesterol, calcium, phosphorus, urea, and bilirubin—and found them to be stable at room temperature for as long as 30 days after they've been separated from cells, Medical News Today reports. That's a big deal when you're trying to test for, say, heart disease or cancer, because it means your results could be off by hours, according to a press release. The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, found that analytes separated from cells were stable for up to seven days at room temperature, and for as long as 30 days in a deep freezer. But if you've got a lot of blood on your hands, you may want to store it in a refrigerator for just a few days.

– When it comes to the human genome, there are more " conserved domains" than there are "predicted genes," according to a study published Wednesday in Nature Communications. The study focused on five different eukaryote genomes— homo sapiens, drosophila melanogaster, arabidopsis thaliana, caenoitis elegans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae—and found a strong correlation between the number of domains in each and the number of predicted genes in each. "We were surprised to find such a strong relationship," study co-author Michael Berenbrink says in a press release. The study is the first to show a link between the number of domains and the number of predicted genes, according to the study's abstract. Previous research has shown a link between the number of domains and the number of genes, but this study shows a link between the number of domains and the number of predicted genes. According to the study, the number of domains and the number of predicted genes can be explained by "functional constraints on interacting domains." In other words, the number of domains and the number of predicted genes can be explained by how many genes are in or out of a domain. The study's lead author, Michael Berenbrink,

According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were 61 cases of multidrug-resistant TB in Irkutsk between 2008 and 2010, compared to 130 cases in nearby yakutia. Of the 61 cases, 36 were from yakutia and 25 were from Irkutsk. Irkutsk had the highest rate of multidrug-resistant TB in Russia, according to a press release. It's not clear why yakutia has the higher rate of multidrug-resistant TB, but researchers say it's probably due to the higher number of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases in yakutia. Irkutsk had the highest rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Russia in 2010, according to the Times. The Times reports Irkutsk has the highest rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the world. According to the press release, Irkutsk has the highest rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the world. Irkutsk has the highest rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the world.

– Men who undergo radical prostatectomy—in which a large portion of the prostate is removed—are often eager to get back to having sex, and a new study suggests that the drug currently used to treat them may actually help. South Korean researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine that the drug pde5-is, also known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, has been shown to be both safe and effective in treating erectile dysfunction in men who have had radical prostatectomy. The researchers looked at the records of 92 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy in Korea between 2007 and 2011. Of those, 47 were given 5mg of pde5-is daily for one hour before surgery, while 116 were given 10mg or 20mg daily for a total of 5mg per day for a total of 5mg per day, reports Live Science. Of the latter group, those who received 10mg or 20mg daily for a total of 10 days saw a 50% increase in erectile function compared to those who received 10mg or 20mg daily for a total of 10 days. The researchers also found that those who received 5mg or 20mg daily for a total of five days saw a 50% increase in erectile function compared to those who received 10mg or 20mg daily for

– Scientists are reporting in the journal Nature Communications that they've successfully grown quantum dots in multiple colors using a technique called "ion implantation induced intermixing." These quantum dots, or qds, are made of semiconducting atoms and can be arranged in any number of ways to produce different colors. The trick is getting the atoms to mix in such a way that the colors change based on whether they're in contact with each other or with electrons in the quantum wells they're made of, Popular Science reports. The upshot is that the researchers were able to manipulate the energy levels of the qds in such a way that the colors changed depending on whether the atoms were in contact with each other or with electrons in the wells. The upshot is that the technology could someday be used to create inexpensive, high-speed lasers that could be used in the military, as well as to create new types of drugs.

– If you've got a sore throat, a fever, or a rash that doesn't go away, there's a new antibiotic on the market that you may want to try before it's too late. The New York Times reports on a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that looked at a class of antibiotics known as lincosamides, which are effective against a wide range of bacteria but have side effects including nausea, rash, and abdominal pain. They're made from three compounds: lincomycin, clindamycin, and pirlimycin. According to a press release, lincosamides are "first choice" antibiotics used in veterinary dermatology. They're also effective against bacteria associated with skin infections, but do have side effects, such as nausea and rash. Researchers found that lincosamides bind to bacteria's ribosomes, which are responsible for producing lactic acid, which is what causes the sore throats, fevers, and rash. They also appear to be effective against a wide range of bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus, and bacteroides. Researchers believe they've figured out a way to block the binding of lincosamides to the

– An 80-year-old Japanese man died of a rare form of penile cancer just a year after it was removed from his inguinal region, where it had metastasized, meaning it had spread to other parts of his body, Live Science reports. penile squamous cell carcinoma (pscc) is a relatively rare form of penile cancer that typically starts in the penis and typically isn't detected until it has spread to other parts of the body. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine notes that penile cancer is often treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, but it's difficult to establish a standard of care in any of the clinical stages, particularly in advanced disease. When the 80-year-old came to the hospital with pain and a smelly exudate in his left inguinal region, doctors used a technique known as mohs chemosurgery to remove the tumor, then treated him with a combination of taxane-based chemotherapy, irradiation, and mohs paste, which has been shown to be an effective treatment for wounds elsewhere in the body, including the breast, head, and neck. A ct scan showed that the tumor had shrunk by 70% after the first course of chemotherapy, but the wound grew and the patient died

– When an 82-year-old woman in South Korea went to the hospital complaining of shortness of breath and dizziness, she wasn't just any old patient. She'd been infected with the parasitic hookworm necator Americanus, reports LiveScience. The woman, who'd lived in a remote area all her life, was diagnosed with chronic iron deficiency anemia. Writing in the Journal of the American College of Physicians, the researchers explain that necator Americanus is "rather prevalent in tropics and southern subtropics while necator duodenale ... is in subtropic or northern temperate zones." The worm lays eggs in the gastrointestinal tracts of infected people that are eaten by other hookworms. When the eggs hatch, they can cause anemia. In this woman's case, the worms had burrowed into the woman's duodenum and caused her to lose about 25% of her body's iron, reports LiveScience. The worms were removed using forceps, and the woman's iron levels returned to normal after a few weeks. But the necator Americanus infection wasn't the woman's only problem: She also had pulmonary tuberculosis, which she'd been treated for in 2006, and the worms had burrowed into her lungs

– A new respiratory virus has been identified in children in Spain, though it's not clear how widespread it is or how serious it is, the New York Times reports. The H1N1 virus causes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, though it's not known how widespread it is or how serious it is, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's also not known whether the virus causes gastroenteritis, which can be life-threatening in children, according to a press release. H1N1 was detected in 48 out of 520 children treated for RSV between 2005 and 2006, according to the study. Of those, 25 had already been tested negative for other viruses, including the rhinovirus, oc43, and norovirus. Researchers say the new virus is similar to H1N1 in its ability to cause RSV infections, though it's not clear how widespread it is or how serious it is. It's also not known whether the virus causes gastroenteritis, which can be life-threatening in children, according to the study.

– When a 7-year-old boy in Spain was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called multicystic dysplastic kidney, or mcdk, doctors didn't think much of it. After all, it's one of the most common forms of congenital urinary tract abnormalities, and it's often associated with cancer. But when the boy was born, his condition was so severe that doctors couldn't figure out why he had the disorder, reports the New York Times. They did, however, discover that the boy's mother had a rare genetic disorder called cowden disease, which is associated with a mutation in the pten gene. In cowden disease, a mutation in the gene results in a form of kidney disease called multicystic dysplastic kidney, or mcdk. The boy's condition was so severe that doctors couldn't figure out why he had it, but they did discover that his mother had a rare form of cowden disease, too. They also discovered that the boy's father had a rare form of cowden disease and that his mother had a rare form of cowden disease herself. "This is the first time we have seen a case of multicystic dysplastic kidney in a child," a researcher tells the Times.

– More than 10 million Americans have peripheral artery disease, which is caused by a buildup of plaque in the blood vessels leading to the retina, according to the American Heart Association. Now researchers report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology that they've found a link between three markers of kidney function and a person's risk of developing pad, reports the New York Times. creatinine, a measure of kidney function, is commonly used to gauge a person's risk of developing pad, but it's often too low. Two of the markers, 2microglobulin and cystatin c, are produced naturally and pass through the glomerular filtration barrier without being affected by muscle mass or secretion, reports Medical News Today. The third, cystatin c, is an inhibitor of the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin c, and has been shown to predict future pad risk. Researchers looked at data from two large studies—one involving more than 120,000 women and one involving more than 50,000 men—and found that people who had 2microglobulin and cystatin c were more likely to develop pad than those who didn't have the markers. "Kidney function has also been associated with incident pad risk in a number of studies and is recognized as a pad risk factor," says lead researcher Dr.

– "Nevertheless, there is no reason for premature pessimism." That's the takeaway from a new study out of Spain, which finds that an "anti-angiogenic" drug that blocks the formation of new blood vessels in cancer patients doesn't work as well as hoped. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at eight anti-angiogenic drugs currently in clinical trials, and found that none worked as well as researchers had hoped. "There are flaws in the methods used to select these inhibitors, in the design of the clinical trials to test their effects, as well as an oversimplified view of tumor vasculature pathophysiology," the study's lead author says in a press release. "There is no reason for premature pessimism, as revealed by current ongoing trials and the clinical developmental status of anti-angiogenic drugs." The drugs block the body's ability to create new blood vessels by blocking the production of a protein called matrix metalloproteinases, which is believed to play a key role in cancer's ability to invade blood vessels and spread to other parts of the body. Most of the anti-angiogenic drugs currently in clinical trials are monotherapies that block only one or several functions of the activated endothelial

– The world's last remaining blue rhino is recovering from a tracheostomy procedure that saved his life, the BBC reports. The 45-year-old male rhino, who died in December, had been unable to breathe for more than two years due to a tracheostomy hole that had developed in his neck. Doctors inserted a tube into his throat that allowed air to pass through his body. The tracheostomy was the first of its kind in the world and one that saved the rhino's life, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. After the tracheostomy procedure, the rhino was able to breathe on his own for the first time in more than two years. The tracheostomy was performed by a single physician and nurse at a hospital in Milan, Italy, according to a press release. Two doctors and a nurse performed the tracheostomy in more than 200 patients between 2011 and 2014, according to the study. There were no complications in 150 patients, according to the press release.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine notes that 25 patients over the age of 50 who had failed at least one other treatment for age-related macular degeneration were given the drug, which blocks the growth of new blood vessels in the eye, every three months for a year. At the end of the study, those who received the drug had a significantly better visual acuity than those who didn't, LiveScience reports. The best visual acuity at the end of the study was 46.28 letters above normal; at the beginning of the study, that was 46.28, LiveScience notes.

– If you've got a bad case of fluorosis, you may want to stop using glass ionomers in your dental restorations. That's according to a new study published in Scientific Reports, which found that the bleaching process used to make glass ionomers does more harm than good. In the study, researchers used two types of bleaching agents—hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide—on three different types of glass ionomers. At home bleaching, the agents ranged from 5.66 to 7.3, while at an office bleaching system, they ranged from 3.6 to 6.5. In lab tests, the bleaching agents caused the glass ionomers to release more fluoride than they would if they were kept in an acidic solution, according to a press release. That's because the hydrogen peroxide causes the glass ionomers to break down into smaller pieces that release more fluoride than they would if they were kept in an acidic solution. The good news is that one of the bleaching agents, opalescence xtra boost, released 38% more fluoride than it would have if kept in an acidic solution. The bad news, however, is that the opalescence xtra boost only released 35% more fluoride than it would have if kept in an acidic solution, according to

– You may have heard of bronchoscopy, a procedure in which a doctor uses a flexible, fiber-optic bronchoscope to peer into the airways of the lungs. But what you may not know is that it can cause serious, even fatal, complications, according to a study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. The study's lead author, Dr. Supat Thammasitboon, tells the New York Times that bronchoscopy can cause pneumonia, vocal cord and airway trauma, and even death. The complication rate for fiber-optic bronchoscopy, which was introduced in the 1960s, has ranged from 0.1% to 11%, with mortality generally reported between 0 and 0.1%, according to the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. But Thammasitboon says the complication rate is much higher for patients who are intubated, meaning the instrument is being used more often. "bronchospasm is one of the most common conditions that we perform fiberoptic bronchoscopy on," says Thammasitboon, who performed the procedure on a 15-year-old boy who had a rare form of lung cancer. The boy, who had a hole in his lung called a tracheostomy, was out of the

– A new study out of India suggests that a person's waist-to-hip ratio is as important as one's BMI in determining whether they have metabolic syndrome, a group of health conditions linked to an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers compared the waist-to-hip ratio—a common measure of obesity—to body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, hip hip-to-hip ratio, and body mass index alone. They found that the waist-to-hip ratio was as important as the BMI in determining whether a person had metabolic syndrome. "We were surprised to find that the waist-to-hip ratio was as important as the BMI in determining the risk of metabolic syndrome," the study's lead author says in a press release. "This is the first study to show that the waist-to-hip ratio is as important as the BMI in determining the risk of metabolic syndrome." The researchers also found that people with a waist-to-hip ratio of .75 or higher were more likely to have metabolic syndrome, while people with a waist-to-hip ratio of .75 or higher were more likely to have diabetes, reports the Los Angeles Times

– There's a new way to prevent gum disease, and it doesn't involve a trip to the dentist. According to a study published in the journal Scientific Reports, a gene called IL-10 was found to be linked to the development of gum disease, as well as to the development of rheumatoid arthritis. IL-10 is found in white blood cells and plays a role in the body's immune system, as well as in the production of inflammatory cytokines, which are involved in the body's response to disease, Live Science reports. When a person's IL-10 levels are high, they're more likely to develop gum disease, according to a press release. When a person's IL-10 levels are low, the body's immune system doesn't have the ability to fight off bacteria that cause gum disease. Researchers found that people with high IL-10 levels were more likely to develop gum disease. They also found that people with high IL-10 levels were more likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis. Researchers believe that by suppressing IL-10, a person's immune system could be able to fight off the bacteria that cause gum disease. The study's lead author, Dr. Supat Thammasitboon, tells Live Science that people with high IL-10 levels

– Men who eat a lot of soy products may have a lower risk of getting the most common form of prostate cancer, according to a new study. Researchers found that men who ate a lot of isoflavones—a type of phytoestrogen that's found in soy, beans, and tofu—had a 30% lower risk of getting the most common form of prostate cancer, NBC News reports. Men who ate a lot of isoflavones were also less likely to have the most common form of prostate cancer, according to the study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. While isoflavones have been linked to lower rates of other cancers and heart disease in Asian men, this is the first study to show a link between isoflavones and a lower risk of prostate cancer, according to a press release. Researchers believe isoflavones may have an effect on the body's ability to fight off cancer, but more research is needed.

– It's one of the most common brain tumors in children, and researchers are reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they've made a big breakthrough in the fight against it. They've found that medulloblastoma, which usually starts in the cerebellum, has a "switch" in the brain that seems to control the growth of the tumor, reports the New York Times. In other words, they've figured out a way to stop the tumor from growing. "This is the first time that we've been able to show that a switch in the brain regulates the growth of a tumor," the lead author of the study from the University of California, San Francisco, tells the Los Angeles Times. It's not a huge surprise, then, that medulloblastoma is the most common childhood brain tumor in the world, with an incidence of about half a million children between the ages of 1 and 15, per the World Health Organization. What's more, it has a limited role in improving the prognosis of patients. Because the tumor usually starts in the glial cells that make up the brain, researchers say they've figured out a way to stop the growth of the tumor by blocking a protein called mitogen-activated kinases 3 and

– There's no need to spend thousands on a pricey plastic surgery procedure just to look younger: A new study out of South Korea suggests that women can reap the benefits of low-level laser therapy for years without spending a dime. Reporting in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers say that women between the ages of 30 and 55 who received the "low-level laser therapy" for six weeks saw no significant differences in the appearance of wrinkles or other signs of aging between the two groups. "This is the first time that low-level laser therapy has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of wrinkles and other signs of skin aging," the lead researcher says in a press release. The study involved 30 women who were split into three groups: one that received low-level laser therapy, one that received radiofrequency (RF) therapy, and one that received electroacupuncture therapy, reports the New York Times. After two 15-minute sessions per week for six weeks, all participants reported a decrease in the appearance of crow's feet and lines around the eyes. The RF group also saw an increase in the production of collagen, while the electroacupuncture group saw an increase in blood flow to the skin's layers, according to the press release.

– A simple blood test can detect a person's risk of a heart attack in as little as nine minutes, according to a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Wall Street Journal reports researchers from France's Ecole Polytechnique used a new cardiac lab test called Tnths that measures the levels of troponin, a biomarker of heart disease, in patients' blood. Tnths can detect a person's risk of a heart attack by measuring the levels of troponin and myoglobin in blood, according to a press release. Tnths can detect a person's risk of a heart attack by measuring the levels of troponin and myoglobin in blood, but it can't determine a person's risk of a heart attack itself, the New York Times reports. According to the study, the new test can detect a person's risk of a heart attack by measuring the levels of troponin and myoglobin in blood. It can also detect a person's risk of a heart attack by measuring the levels of troponin and myoglobin in blood. Researchers say the new test—which can detect a person's risk of a heart attack by measuring the levels of troponin and myoglobin in blood—has the potential

– When a 50-year-old man went to the hospital complaining of abdominal pain over two weeks, doctors thought he had acute pancreatitis. But when a skin biopsy on the left lower leg four days later revealed "a diffuse subcutaneous fat necrosis and ghost—like cells with thick shadowy walls and no nuclei," doctors decided he had pancreatic panniculitis, "a very rare malady," they write in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The man's condition worsened over the next 10 days, and he and his family refused treatment, until a skin biopsy on the fourth day revealed "a fine granular basophilic material deposited within and around the necrotic fat cells," according to the study. The cause of pancreatic panniculitis is still unknown, but the release of pancreatic enzymes such as trypsin or amylase into the circulation may increase the permeability of the microcirculation, which in turn leads to fat necrosis. The man's pancreas was swollen and filled with fluid, and a CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed "mild effusion" on the second day of admission, as well as multiple hepatic cysts on the left anterior perirenal space and massive ascites on the left lower leg. On the fourth day of treatment, the man's condition

– When a 30-year-old woman went to the emergency room at Montefiore Medical Center in New York last month with a blood clot on her lung, she expected to get a quick test to determine if she had lung cancer. Instead, she got a blood test for HIV that turned out to be wrong—and now she's suing the hospital, CBS News reports. The woman, identified only as Jane Doe, filed the suit last week in New York State Supreme Court. She says the hospital told her it had a state-of-the-art lab that performed the test, but it wasn't certified by the New York State Department of Health, and it wasn't certified by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, reports the New York Daily News. The woman says the lab told her it had two different levels of liquid quality control, but it wasn't certified by the state, and it wasn't certified by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She says the hospital told her it would send her a replacement test for the HIV test, but it wasn't certified by the COG and it wasn't certified by the state, so she filed the suit.

– If you've got a bad back, you may want to give it a rest before playing sports, a new study suggests. Researchers at the University of Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology that back pain is more common in men than in women, and that women are more likely to suffer from it, reports the New York Times. The researchers looked at data on more than 5,600 students between the ages of 12 and 18, all of whom played at least one sport. They found that back pain was more common in men than in women, and that women were more likely to suffer from it, reports Live Science. "The results of this study should not be interpreted as a warning about playing sports, but rather as evidence that it is important to give your back a break before playing," the lead researcher says in a press release. "The more time a person spends practicing sports, the more likely they are to suffer from back pain." The researchers also looked at smoking habits, and found that students who smoked were more likely to suffer from back pain than those who didn't. The lead researcher tells the Times that it's not clear why back pain is more common in men, but he thinks it has to do

– If you're one of the millions of people who suffer a heart attack and are successfully resuscitated after it, you may want to think twice about shivering. A new study suggests that shivering may actually hamper the body's ability to heal itself after a heart attack, the New York Times reports. In the study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers found that pigs injected with a drug called sevoflurane saw their cerebral cortex shrink and their neurological defect score fall. The drug, which blocks the body's production of a protein linked to brain inflammation, also reduced the size of the hippocampus, the part of the brain that plays a key role in memory, according to a press release. "The idea is to prevent the body from going into a vicious cycle of vasoconstriction and shivering," the study's lead author tells the Times. "If the body doesn't have the ability to heal itself after a heart attack, it's going to go into a vicious cycle of muscle weakness, blood clots, and brain damage." The researchers say that while sevoflurane is already being used to treat heart attack patients, it's difficult to recommend it for the same reason as therapeutic hypothermia, which has been used

– It's been more than 60 years since the first nuclear bomb was dropped on Earth, and the waste from those bombs and other weapons has been sitting around waiting to be disposed of. The problem is that it's going to take more than a century to dispose of all the nuclear waste the world has to offer, and it's going to take that long, according to a new study published in Scientific Reports. The problem is that the materials being stored in underground tanks aren't behaving as they should in the long run, and they're leaking into the environment at a rate that's "unacceptable," the study's lead author tells the New York Times. That's because they're being stored in structures that aren't designed to handle the amount of radioactive material that's being released, and those structures aren't designed to handle the amount of radioactive material that's being released. The lead author explains that the problem isn't that the structures aren't designed to handle the amount of radioactive material that's being released. It's that the structures aren't designed to handle the amount of radioactive material that's being released, and they're not designed to handle the amount of radioactive material that's

– A new study out of the University of Southern California suggests that a woman's immune system may play a role in her unborn child's health. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at the levels of 42 cytokines— proteins that trigger the body's immune system—in the blood of 16 women during the first trimester, then 34 weeks, and 34 weeks of pregnancy. The women were split into two groups: one that didn't have any complications, and the other that did. Researchers found that the women's immune systems changed over the course of the pregnancy, with the latter group's levels of cytokines rising more than the others, reports the Los Angeles Times. The upshot is that the women's immune systems changed in a way that affected the fetus's ability to fight certain pathogens. The study doesn't prove that the women's immune systems played a role in the fetus's health, only that they changed in a way that affected the fetus's ability to fight those pathogens, reports the New York Times. The lead author of the study, who is also a professor of pediatrics at USC's School of Medicine, tells the Times that more research is needed to establish a cause-and-effect

– If you want to lose weight but don't want to work out every day, a new study suggests you might want to take antioxidant vitamins. Researchers found that people who took vitamin E for two weeks had lower levels of fat in their bodies than those who took a dummy pill, LiveScience reports. The study, published in the American Journal of Physiology: Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, looked at the effects of resistance training on the body's levels of vitamin E, which is found in fruits and vegetables, as well as vitamin D, which is found in dark leafy greens. "Our findings suggest that vitamin E may play a key role in protecting the body from the negative health consequences of exercise-induced lipid peroxidation," the study's lead author says in a press release. Vitamin E acts as a chain, "breaking antioxidant in a fat soluble environment thus preventing the propagation of free radical reactions," according to the release. The study found that people who took vitamin E had lower levels of vitamin E in their blood than those who took a dummy pill. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends people take vitamin e as part of a balanced diet. (Another recent study found that people who take antioxidant vitamins have lower cholesterol.)

– When a 45-year-old Japanese woman went to the doctor, she was shocked to learn that she had a rare and incredibly rare condition called acromegaly. It's caused by a growth on the pituitary gland that triggers a surge of hormones that can cause extreme inflammation of the eyes, reports the New York Times. The condition is so rare that doctors didn't even know they had it until this year, when a CT scan revealed a mass about the size of an orange in the woman's left eye, reports Live Science. The mass had moved so quickly that doctors couldn't tell whether it was in the woman's right eye or her left eye. The woman, who has since had surgery to remove the mass, is believed to be the first known patient in the world to have acromegaly, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's thought to affect one out of every 100,000 people, but it's rare enough that doctors didn't even know they had it until this year. The woman's condition is so rare that no other known cases have been found, but it's not clear how common it is or how effective the current treatment is. The best guess is that the mass

– Those with asthma might want to take note: A new study out of China suggests that they're at higher risk of migraine. Researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong looked at 41,011 patients newly diagnosed with asthma in the Chinese government's health insurance program between 2000 and 2005, and found that those with asthma were nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with migraine than their non-asthma counterparts, reports the New York Times. Migraine is a "highly prevalent and disabling neurological disorder characterized by episodic unilateral headache attacks that are often accompanied by photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting," according to a press release. "The goal of current asthma management is to focus on managing rather than curing the disease," says the lead author of the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The researchers say their study doesn't prove cause-and-effect, but they did find a link between asthma and a higher risk of migraine. The study doesn't prove that asthma causes migraine, only that it's more common in people with asthma, reports the Los Angeles Times. It's not clear why asthma is linked to migraine, but it's known that people with asthma are more likely to suffer from other respiratory problems, such as

– If you've ever dreamed of having your teeth fixed with a set of brackets, you're in luck: Scientists say they've figured out a way to do so without damaging the enamel on the teeth, Popular Science reports. The old-fashioned way of bonding brackets to teeth involves etching the surface of the teeth, rinsing the surface, drying, and applying resin to the surface, according to a press release. The problem is that the process can cause damage to the tooth's enamel, which can last for years, Popular Science notes. Researchers in Germany say they've figured out a way to bond brackets to teeth without damaging the enamel, using a compound that's "calcium-aluminum-silicate" and is "calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate," Popular Science reports. The compound is "calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate" and "calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate" is "calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate" itself, Popular Science notes. The researchers tested the new compound by having two groups of teeth with brackets bonded to each other with two different adhesive systems, Popular Science reports. In the first group, the teeth were exposed to water for 24 hours; in the second group, the teeth were removed with pliers at a speed of

It's caused by a mutation in a gene that makes a type of bone cell, called an osteoclast, not work as it should, reports the New York Times. As a result, the body produces more osteoclasts than it actually needs, and when those osteoclasts don't work as they should, the body produces more new osteoclasts than it actually needs. In osteopetrosis, the new osteoclasts don't work as they should, and the body produces more osteoclasts than it actually needs. As a result, people with osteopetrosis have more bone mass than they should, and as a result, their bone density increases, reports Live Science. So what's going on? Researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that osteoclasts need to be "perfectly polarized with a ruffle border and a sealing zone" to do their job. They also need to be able to "resorb bone matrix by the action of specific proteins." Researchers say they've figured out a way to reverse the

– Japanese children born to parents who survived the 2011 Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear disaster are more likely to have a genetic disorder called dwarfism, according to a new study. The phenomenon occurs when one copy of a gene—called a segmental copy—is missing from a person's DNA. Researchers found that children born to parents who didn't have the disorder were more likely to have dwarfism than children born to parents who did, according to a press release. They also found that children born to parents who had the disorder were twice as likely to have dwarfism than children born to parents who didn't have the disorder. The researchers, whose study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, say it's the first time such a disorder has been found in a population of survivors of the world's worst nuclear disaster. They say the disorder—which affects one out of every 100 Japanese children and is linked to dwarfism, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder—is likely caused by a loss of a gene that helps control the body's immune system. The researchers say more research is needed to figure out why the disorder occurs and how to prevent it.

– If you've ever suffered a traumatic brain injury, chances are you've suffered an increase in inflammation, which can lead to brain damage. Now researchers at Johns Hopkins University report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they've figured out a way to counteract that inflammation in mice. They found that a transcription factor called nrf2 regulates the body's antioxidant response, and when nrf2 is turned on, cells produce more of the antioxidants they need to fight off oxidative stress, reports the New York Times. When nrf2 is turned on, the body produces more of the antioxidants it needs, and when nrf2 is not turned on, the body produces more of the other antioxidants it needs. The researchers found that when nrf2 is turned on, the body produces more of the antioxidants it needs, and when nrf2 is not turned on, the body produces more of the other antioxidants it needs. It's not the first time nrf2 has been found to help fight off inflammation, but it's the first time it's been shown to do so in such a large scale. "This is the first time that it's been shown that nrf2 regulates the body's antioxidant response after a traumatic

– If you're in an intensive-care unit and you have a heart attack, chances are you're in the right place. But if you're not in an intensive-care unit and you have a heart attack, chances are you're not getting the right treatment at the right time. That's according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which found that patients treated in an intensive-care unit were more likely to die over a two-year period than those treated in a non-intensive-care unit. In fact, the study found that patients treated in an intensive-care unit were more likely to die from a heart attack or stroke than those treated in a non-intensive-care unit, the New York Times reports. The study's lead author, Dr. Yuval Nir, tells the Times that intensive-care patients are often sicker and more likely to die than patients treated in a non-intensive-care unit. In fact, intensive-care patients were more likely to die from a heart attack or stroke than patients treated in a non-intensive-care unit. The study found that patients treated in an intensive-care unit were twice as likely to die from a heart attack or stroke than patients treated in

– A new study finds that hospitals in the central Illinois area have some of the highest rates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the country. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign surveyed 77 hospitals in the area and found that 42% of isolates tested there were resistant to at least one common bacteria, including E. faecalis, which causes antibiotic-resistant infections in humans, reports the Chicago Tribune. That's higher than the national average of 53%, but still below the 91% rate found in the southwest part of the state, according to the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's not clear what's causing the resistance, but researchers say it could be due to hospitals' lack of expertise in dealing with bacteria, reports the Chicago Sun-Times. The study also found that hospitals in the south and west of the state have higher rates of E. faecalis and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus than their counterparts in the central part of the state. The researchers say it's time for the US to create a "master anti-microbial care institution" that would allow hospitals to make more informed decisions about how to treat patients.

– Pandemic H1N1 wasn't as widespread as previously thought, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But it was still responsible for more hospitalizations and deaths than the previous year's pandemic, researchers report in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Between August 2009 and April 2010, all 50 states and the district of Columbia reported hospitalizations and deaths related to H1N1—either lab-confirmed or syndromic, according to the CDC. Of those, 36 states reported laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations and 17 states reported syndromic hospitalizations. The report found that the national incidence of hospitalizations and deaths during the pandemic was 5.4%, compared to 8.8% during the previous year. The highest rates of hospitalizations and deaths were in New York and California, which had the highest rates of hospitalizations and deaths among all states, according to the report. New Jersey had the lowest rates of hospitalizations and deaths.

– When a 45-year-old woman in India fell and hit her head on the pavement, she suffered a traumatic shoulder injury that left her in pain and unable to move her arm—but she didn't need to undergo surgery, doctors say. The woman had no history of epilepsy or instability in other joints, and doctors say the injury, which left her with increased vertical diameter of axilla in her shoulder, was caused by a "unique mechanism of injury," LiveScience reports. The woman "had no history of seizure, epilepsy, previous shoulder dislocation or instability in other joints," the doctors write in a study published in the British Medical Journal. After the fall in 2010, the woman "immediately post trauma had severe pain and restriction of both shoulders," the doctors say. "On examination arms were abducted and externally rotated. There was loss of round contour of shoulder with increased vertical diameter of axilla anteriorly." The doctors say the woman was able to walk with the help of a walking stick after surgery, but she still has pain and weakness in her arm.

– Guys who grow up to be obese may have an advantage over those who don't, according to a new study in the British Medical Journal. Researchers looked at 2,547 men and women born after World War II, and found that those who grew up to be obese were more likely to be obese as adults, reports the New York Times. Specifically, those who grew up to be overweight were more likely to be obese than those who grew up to be thin. "We were surprised to find such a strong association," the lead researcher says in a press release. "We were also surprised to find such a low correlation." The study doesn't prove cause-and-effect, but the lead researcher tells the Times that people who grew up to be obese may have had an advantage over those who grew up to be thin. For example, people who grew up to be thin were more likely to be obese than people who grew up to be thin. The study didn't look at why the obese grew up to be obese, but the lead researcher tells the Times that it may have something to do with the fact that the obese grew up to be taller than the non-obese.
