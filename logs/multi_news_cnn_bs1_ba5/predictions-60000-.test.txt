– The Department of Transportation is considering new rules to make sure plane seats are just as cramped for humans as they are for animals, reports the Huffington Post. A consumer advisory group set up by the DOT this week said at a public hearing that while it is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't set minimum amounts of space for humans. "In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans, it is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers," said Charlie Leocha, a representative on the committee. At the hearing, the DOT also heard from experts who

– The BBC is trying to figure out how to make its radio more "digital first." The problem is that people are listening less and less, and the amount of time they spend on the airwaves is at an all-time low, reports the Telegraph. In the last three months of 2014, the average person in Britain listened to BBC radio for 10 hours a week, or about seven hours less than in the same period a decade ago. The BBC blames the trend on people spending more time on social media and the pace of life in general. But the New York Times reports that the drop is even more pronounced among young people, who used

US Attorney Ronald Machen says she can take the Fifth if she wants to, but her refusal to do so was within her rights.

The Independent reports that the actor's chest hair is noticeably thicker in the images, suggesting he's gone for a "gentle pruning" rather than a full beard. The Daily Mail notes that it's unlikely that a character in Poldark would have gone for the razor, so a "bandage" of hair remains. (See Turner in a picture here.)

The survey found that 26% of employers were less inclined to hire obese people because of their lack of awareness of the laws
