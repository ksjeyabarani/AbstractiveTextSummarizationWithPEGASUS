"If you shoot that dog and he dies, that's murder of a law enforcement officer," Detective Philip DiMola pressed Ivins Rosier on Nov. 21, 2012, in an interrogation recorded on video and watched by a Palm Beach County jury during its deliberations Friday .
As it turned out, the juvenile then confessed to DiMola, the 5-year-old German shepherd was euthanized two days later .

Researchers looked at tiny structures called telomeres that safeguard the ends of our chromosomes, which store our DNA code .
These protective caps prevent the loss of genetic information during cell division .
As we age and our cells divide, our telomeres get shorter - their structural integrity weakens, which can tell cells to stop dividing and die .
In the study, nurses who largely stuck to eating a Mediterranean diet had longer, healthier telomeres .
No individual dietary component shone out as best, which the researchers say highlights the importance of having a well-rounded diet .

The New Jersey governor has been dogged by a scandal stemming from revelations that members of his administration conspired to shut down traffic lanes leading on to the George Washington Bridge .

Trump has come under fire in the past week for condoning the rough treatment of a Black Lives Matter protester at a campaign rally in Alabama and for tweeting a chart with made-up statistics overstating the percentage of white murder victims killed by blacks.
