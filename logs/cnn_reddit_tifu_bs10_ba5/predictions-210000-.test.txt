-----:34
i bought a bag of gummy bears and was going to eat them in bed and go straight to sleep .
I always throw my wallet in the air and see if I can make it land directly this small tray on my dresser .

-----:35
i had forgotten that i had an ear wax dissolvent bottle that looked exactly the same shape and size of my eye drop bottle.

-----:38
This happened 3 days ago, but i didn't have time to write it until now .
-----:39
so this happened a few years ago but still makes me cringe whenever i think about it .
i eventually quit the job a few months later because i felt the constant pressure made me lose focus whenever i needed it most .
-----:40
i worked with a youth group in a neighbourhood and knew a lot of the parents. this one lady in particular was always very warm and we would chat often.

i being a kinky fucker kinda liked it and shoved that finger even deeper. about 2 mins in the i'm edging and the burning is intensifying.

i'd never tried kool-aid fizzy, so thought it was worth a try .
i tore open one of the sachets, opened the bottle of fizzy water, and poured the whole satchet in. crossing the kitchen to get something to mix the powder with, i heard a fizzing sound.
i ran back to the bottle to transfer it to the sink, but it was too late - in my efforts to contain the fountain of undiluted kool-aid, i'd got the stuff _everywhere_!
-----:62
my fuck up happened early this morning and things have just calmed down enough that i now have time to type this .

we had talked on the internet for a year before she came to the same college i was attending.

what follows is a three-day romp through the pleasures of sex i never knew existed to that point.
-----:67
so i should preface this by saying this happened a week ago .
-----:68
during our junior year, his mom apparently got very sick.

when i was going on a family vacation, we needed to take the plane.

i'm in a class that i know no one and being the only guy.

i live in an apartment complex that has underground parking and outside lot parking.
in order to park in the lot, you have to be a resident of the complex and have a parking placard.
if you don't you either need to park in the visitor designated parking area, or on the street.
-----:75
i woke up in the morning with a severe hang over and a rumbly in my tumbly .

My friend's mother is a real-estate agent .
She showed up at my door and hands me an envelope and says "its no big deal but i don't want your mom to worry this Christmas" she tells me to give it to my mom and leaves.
Now look i live in a suburb of Detroit so 300$ is quite a lot of money to people aorund here, when my friend's family did live around here they were easily some of the richest people in town.
-----:80
3 weeks ago, i got a job at a grocery store as a stock boy .
about 8:30 when my manager says he wants to talk to me in the office .
He said that i was being too slow and not interacting with customers enough .
-----:81
my friend sees my gum on my desk and asks if he can have some. not caring i tell him sure and continue working.
Later that day i decide i want some gum so i grab my hubba bubba and open it...
i thought people only did this on 4chan or reddit for people to rage, not to actually do it to someone. idk if he and i can be friends anymore...
-----:82
last night, i went to a friend's dorm to drink beer and pretend to be irish for a day. at some point, i blacked out for about an hour.

-----:88
my boyfriend's mom bought me tickets to the trans siberian orchestra show for my birthday. she spent roughly $150 on them so my we could go see them.

-----:89
i am not racist or prejudice to anyone .
-----:90
i'm on new medications that each severely dehydrate me.

-----:91
i wanted to shoot some hoops. there was a basketball in the football goal, and i went to get it from the goal.

-----:95
i was taking a biology test in class. these are the types of tests that they give you 30 minutes to do, all multiple choice (like 10 simple questions)
-----:96
my high school was a smaller off shoot of the main high school in my town which i went to because the public high school was wayyy over crowded .
the problem with going to the smaller school is that you get to know everyone in your class, e.g. when i graduated there were at most 20 people all of whom i knew by first and last names on stage getting their diplomas .
-----:97
i have never in my life heard a little girl make such a noise. it sounded like the [predator](http://slog.thestranger.com/files2008/06/predator.jpg) squeal .
-----:98
We threw small machetes at each other and parried with our wooden shields .
fortunately, it was small, and only the tip went in .
