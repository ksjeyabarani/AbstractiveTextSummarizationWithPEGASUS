so our french teacher asked us to make an interview in french as a proyect, my friends and i made a pretty long video (compared to the other teams) in which i added a lot of memes when i edited it, and also i uploaded it to youtube (http://youtu.be/vy0p71xapms skip to minute 4, the first moments are really boring), then i sended it to our teacher, which had a blast watching it, but my friends and i had fear that we were going to show it to all the class, and that's exactly what happened.

the sheets could not be changed as that would be obvious, like the stains. why one would need mayonnaise or something else for popcorn i'm not sure. and they were not oblivious to the various stains which were obviously not caused by the popcorn nor drinks we had.

thats it really...
anyways, its 2nd to last stop and a woman with a pram comes on with the cutest little shit you could imagine.

so i'm housesitting this week and decided it would be a good time to see if the car even runs (i'm pretty sure she hasn't driven it in over a year, so the gas is probably bad). so i thought i would try to remove the key (that's supposed to be stuck) from the ignition. .my aunt comes back in like 3 days so i've got some time but right now i'm freaking the hell out. also, i had another minor fuckup by going to /r/midget (nsfw) before checking to see what the actual subreddit for

for a moment i thought that this is quite weird and doesn’t sound legit at all but hey as the stupid a** that i am i thought ok let’s do it... we did the trade and after a few minutes he meant that there aren’t any items like mine in the inventory of the bots and that the only way i could recover my value of skins was to give him some of my other skins and he would change the odds of the homepage in a way that i would win a really valuable knife in the next game with a 100% certainty... sounds ridiculous right?

so it all went good but then around 8pm i started to get really sleepy, and laied down. it was around 12pm and they had gotten home, all drunk, yelling at me to go get the girl.

.like most tifu this happened a year ago, i worked with my dad in a very small business which i sort of followed him around since i was little and when i was around 21 and still in college my dad begged me to come home and help him not lose the business, and i did...and sort of sacrificed any sort of personal life goals about my career and what not..but my dad and me went through a lot with a bi-polar greek manic depressive mother..but that's another subreddit..but that's another subreddit..

i walk in the bathroom and see the stalls don't have doors, which isn't something particularly great for me as i could tell it was going to be.. after about 20 more minutes of being in the ocean i see police cars and crowds of people start to pull up to the bathroom.

my brothers are twins and they're 8 years old. this caught my brothers' attention quickly, and they abandoned their soccer game to watch wwe with me while i explained the rules and told them about my favorite wrestlers. my brothers, being 8 years old, didn't know the *other* meaning of the word horny, so in their minds they had no reason not to say it.
 they were on the ground pushing each other around, after one of my little brothers announced to the entire checkout area that he's horny.

i go to the bathroom pee and decide i'm also thirsty so i'm going to head to the kitchen and get a drink. as i'm getting my drink i think i hear something outside, most likely nothing but i'm a little startled since i can't hear so well with my ear plugs in.

well we quickly recognize each other (went to a smallish private high school) talk a bit here and there no more than outside of class, but got along pretty well. fast forward to about 30 mins ago and i'm sitting on facebook and lo and behold she gets on.

i called my dad and showed him the four plates, asking him if he saw the same numbers. the student said "i only see one number from these pictures." pleased that someone else also said the same, my father gloated and said to his co-workers, "see? from time to time though i do forget that he is color-blind, telling him to get the red thingy or the violet thingy or that the red thing or the violet thingy is his like "your toothbrush is violet and mine is blue." .

chinese subways are typically very crowded during rush hours, so no matter how shaky things get people don't ever fall over because one would just end up leaning against another body. a few stops later, this gorgeous woman stepped on to the train and decided to stand near me. she eventually stopped talking and i was laughing at the cops who were trying to get her to stop.
 i extended my arm and wrapped it around her shoulders, slowly bring her to a gentle stop (bent my fucking leg too to make it even more dramatic because, fuck me, let me enjoy my moment).

recently i feel like i've been inching out of the friend zone, so i've been trying to flirt and impress her a bit more.

i'm very much so straight and had no intention of this happening but seeing as life is a bitch i guess we can't always get what we want.
 i was raised with a dog and having one to play with and pet on and love and get love from was a great deal to me. having not been raised in the greatest home, with 4 siblings and myself (i am the youngest), i dealt with a lot of shit from my siblings cause we hadn't had much growing up and i being the youngest had a hard time and just wanted to have a friend to turn to to have fun with like any other

you drank some flat coke, so what?" but here's where the problem is: it wasn't simply flat. ann was a bit weird; she smoked a lotta weed in an illegal state, had a water bed, was in her late sixties, had her house paid off, lived alone. she invited us to go have some homemade ice-cream. she was a friend of my parents, so she trusted them, and allowed my entire family to go: myself, my mom and dad, my brother, and my sister.
 okay, i'll just go run around (this is in a rather rural state

when i opened the door, i couldn't help but notice the entire lobby of the college building that was usually full of people was completely empty. so, i make my way through the empty halls to the room where my class usually is and couldn't help but say "what the fuck?" out loud when i noticed the lights in the classroom were out and the door was locked.

-----:22
i swapped the battery and left the detector to find some ear plugs and test the new battery when the room suddenly started to smell funny.
-----:23
at this point i felt that this was my last chance to get my stretched earlobes back to its old size. (it's easier to re-stretch if not to much time has passed) i wasn't really ready to get rid of them, and convinced myself that i could easily get rid of them at any time because of my amazing healing capabilities. "i might as well re-stretch them back now before it's too late!"
and so i followed through and tried to jam my old plugs back into my stupid shrunken hole, and i managed to force the fucker back in.

i didn't really get a good breakfast, so i go to buy a snack from the vending machine ( i didn't want to starve before dinner) after carefull consideration, i decide on a tuna sandwich. my mom glanses at me like im the pickiest little brat in the world, and tells me that "it's ok as long as it smells good." the sandwich doesn't really smell at all, so i ignore it and finish up. im crouching over the toilet whilst puking in a container, my mom is crying ( probably thought i was dying), and my dad is still snoor

.q showed me a message he recieved from a girl he had not so recently started talking to, telling about how she had helped my friend g cheat on his girlfriend. after tough decision making and a lengthy thought process i went to my closest friend n, completely forgetting q as q and g don't know each other that well. i hope q will forgive me for not keeping his secret, and not telling him i was going to tell n and confront g first.

now i've seen a lot of shit in my 25 years, but i've never seen a dog show. replace with a synonym /r/fatpeoplehate was banned and /r/showswithdogs is not. after about 100 viruses and popups on my phone, i see a play button over a black box. chrome says its playing audio but i hear nothing. she texted me back and forth trying to explain my phone battery was right up against the wall.
 there's a girl there i'm really into, and i spent an hour last night writing her a poem.

it is important to note that my sophomore year, i liked to make those beatboxing sounds like scratches and what not, but this one in particular, i would just but my finger over the middle of my lips like i was shushing somebody, and just sucked air in.

either way, we always have a full filter pitcher of ice-cold water in the fridge. every time we get a glass, we add more water to the pitcher. i always wake up before my dad, and i'm always thirsty, so once i popped out of bed, i headed to the kitchen for a drink of water. i pulled the door of the fridge open, grabbed the pitcher, and prepared to pour a glass of water...when i noticed something **very** off.

.being from california, i hadn't had a lot of interaction with cold weather and snow- meaning sometimes you have to pee really bad when you are in a really warm room and walk outside to a cold snowy area.
 the next day the class met at school, jumped in a big long yellow bus and we traveled up to the cabins in the mountains.

.before i go on i should say that i have this habit of whenever i get home in my room i always throw my wallet in the air and see if i can make it land directly this small tray on my dresser. *i tossed my wallet on bed and chucked my gummy bears and phone at my tray.* i was tired that after seeing myself toss the wallet on the bed, my body still proceeded to do this sub because i don't allow anyone else to eat anything safe just because the weight of the items is different they landed no where close to my tray.

he told me to come outside of the room and then asked me how much did i drink and if i brought a crazy drunk girl over. i was like "yeah, i brought a girl over but she's okay, not crazy." .

so this happened 3 days ago, but i didn't have time to write it until now.
 a little back story before we begin:
so it is that time of the year, and as a newly graduated high school student in the u.s., it was time to go to my college orientation. try to some how position my ding dong in a way that will allow me to pee in the cup, but i can't do it while the car is still moving. now, it's pretty much just an extra piece of road next to the interstate, so no real privacy there, but at least
-----:39
blushing red i call for my crew, stick my hand under my jacket and we run back to the helicopter to work out this mess. i pour a little lubricant on my hand to smoothen it up, but as so much time has already passed i smash it on the floor behind the pilots seat.

.so one day i see her on the bus pushing a stroller with a baby in it (when did she have a baby?) and with the most emphatic smile i can muster up i look her right in the eyes and give her the warmest "hello, how are you doing?". a couple of weeks later i get my opportunity, i see her getting on the bus that goes from downtown to our neighbourhood. i got that feeling but i thought i began to doubt myself because of the evil doppelganger. i just stand there awkwardly, i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to get out of this
-----:41
i just thought to myself she probably lived close to her job so she always got home before me (yea i know dumb assumption this should have been a red flag already).
 so far so good, i'm really getting along with her and she asks me if i want to play a truth or dare game with her. i really freaked out, i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to trust her anymore.

let me just preface by saying that one of my irrational fears is that i will forget to the lock the bathroom door at work, and someone will open it on me mid-stream (i'm a male). story time:
i was walking around the halls while the students were in class, and i decided to stop at the faculty restroom on my way back to my classroom.

(while in highschool) one day in drafting class me and my best friend were talking about the girl and i was mentioning how she was beautiful kind etc. we keep talking and suddenly this muscular baseball player starts talking louder so we hear announcing we are talking about his girlfriend.

when i was younger, my dad would get her a coffee gift card and some cups, and occasionally a coffee-maker on her birthday/mother's day. .i ask a friend who works at a coffee store if he can help me fill it up and transport it. .the staples and nails holding in the new carpet come undone and i go flying backwards down the stairs with my friend, and tumbling into the doorway with that burnt liquid from hell falling on friend and i. my parents would've screamed or tried to help, but they were too baffled as to why i was holding a giant coffee cup that looked like

the nozzle was sitting on the shelf next to the mostly emptied container - fuckfuckfuck - surrounded by a sticky puddle of half-crystallized weed killer. i figured out that the tube had still been full when i put it away - the container acted as a siphon, emptying itself out.

i was sort of taken aback by the fact that she didn't get my pop culture reference, so i told her to google tonya harding.
 then it hits me - tonya harding didn't only bash nancy kerrigan's knee (the reference i was talking about), she also made a terrible amateur porn vid that i had forgotten about 15 years ago.
-----:50
now, just outside the main doors was a sign saying "visitors must wear plastic bags on their feet." with 2 boxes underneath, one containing a bunch of rubber bands and the other containing blue plastic bags. "the sign totally said to wear the bags underthat, you're golden" i kept saying to myself as the interview progressed.
 the construction workers are allowed to use this building's facilities as long as they wear plastic bags on their feet.

-----:51
i was getting really discouraged with the relationship, and one night after a particularly bad fight, i got really drunk and sexted a girl i had been talking to/flirting with about a year ago via the app kik. she had tried to set me a later alarm, but since she's blind as a bat without glasses/contacts, she had accidentally opened up the kik app and came across the messages i had sent to that girl a month ago.
-----:52
meanwhile, my grandma had her birthday the next day and because she lives in the other city, i thought it would be nice to buy her flowers and take a bus a day earlier, so we could spend more time together.
 the bus to the other city was leaving in about an hour, so i decided to go home really quick, change my clothes and then buy the flowers.
-----:53
sooooo, i get the bright idea to cover a finger in lube and shove that fucker right on up my ass.

-----:54
(that's a whole other story, but the short of it is i can't stand it when i'm in a group and no one is talking to me.) so, kay has been encouraging me and trying to help me sort it all out. one of our regular attendees (another guy) typically likes to give side hugs to all the girls as they leave. so, kay gets ready to leave, she is standing at the top of the stairs talking to someone.
-----:55
whenever i fall asleep and smell my bed sheets, go to a concert, or simply do my everyday routine, i get turned on whenever i psychologically think that a certain item smells like pussy (or may potentially smell like it). however, that day was also a long day so i crashed in the bed, but with her panties around my head and the cloth wrapped around my nose.

.fast forward to today and still i haven't left my hotel room for more than 20 minutes at a time since i got sick. *"what no it's ok i'll use it anyways!" "umm, no you can't, there's someone fixing it."*
i was desperate, and i told him it was an emergency, and he laughed it off saying, *"just go in the ocean, everyone does."* turns out the closest bathroom was a 7-10 minute walk away...
 so get into the water and start swimming out as fast as i can. i look down into the

meanwhile i am trying to hold my laugh in this old lady, easely in her 75-80 years rolls up to me in a wheelchair and wants to ask me something, i look up at her and rip one of my in-ear headphones out, letting the other one stay in.
-----:58
all i could say was “h-hey mom i still need that book!” usually my mother actually does what i say when i’m upset like that, and i think she would’ve gave me the book back, but oprah already reached for it, and sure enough the dirty pics were exposed.

-----:59
i let my body go like a pendulum and fell back to my senses after noticing that everything ended up on my feet again...that’s how i laughed when i bounced back to my senses.
 i held by the steel rod of the automatic door and leaned towards outside, looking directly at the girls. i flew like a bird and landed like a falcon in the air, like a falcon in the sky.
 i held by the steel rod of the automatic door and leaned towards outside, looking directly at the girls.

as i approach the parking lot i see a white car resembling that of my friend's with its headlights on, so i think to myself, *oh she must have been waiting for a couple minutes now, better hurry it up.* i quicken my pace and make it to the passenger door of the car. i look up slightly and the driver who's also female looks up at me and asks, "*tim?"* i was caught off guard and just muttered "oh shit, i'm sorry, wrong car...." i quickly slam the door and turn around trying to find my friend's car nearby.

seeing an unopened bottle of fizzy water, i thought i may as well use it to make the kool-aid - it would save me using a bowl or a pitcher to make the drink, and i'd never tried kool-aid fizzy, so i thought it was worth a try.
 i frantically ran to get some kitchen roll and bleach (to clean the surfaces, i didn't want to drink _quite_ yet) and spent literally the next two hours cleaning the bright red food dye which, by this point, had managed to spread out across the entire kitchen.

it was quite a nice morning, but after eating the bun i felt i there were dozens of the poppy seeds stuck between my teeth and i didn't have much time left to brush my teeth again so i threw a piece of gum into my mouth and went out.

like the one i find out that she's highly bisexual and has had flings with her friends back in high school. after that night, i listen to her talking to one of her high school friends that is going to college in the next state over. after a few phone calls, she tells me that she wants me to take her to a city between our college and her friend's college and rent a hotel room for a weekend.
 so i do, and it happens to be the city where my best friend and his girlfriend are from, so we ride back with them and go to the hotel.

instead of just popping the corner of [the container](http://elingreso.com/wp-content/uploads/mint_in_plastic_container_from_chinese_restaurant.jpg), or pouring it into a bowl, or any other number of ways to reheat chinese food, i thought i'd poke a hole in the top to vent the steam. i keep going, thinking i'd be able to stop the knife from going through the second half of the plastic.

i opened his gallery to find pictures and videos of him with other women, now i knew he had had a decent amount of ex girlfriends and hadn't deleted anything on his phone recently but being a stereotypical woman i overreacted and decided to go through his messages to see who those women were and what they meant to him only to find that during the first 3 months of our relationship he had been avidly flirting with multiple women and even going so far as to ask one of them for pictures of her breasts.
-----:71
so i think to myself, "what are the chances of being in this w/o a single person i know." so i take the class hoping to get better physically and feel a bit better about myself. the only reason i'm planning on staying in this class is: raise my fitness level & maybe if i'm dropped in the worst situation for my social phobia maybe it would go away. if my social fear becomes unbearable i'm planning on just shelling out 50bucks to get the hell out.

in order to park in the lot, you have to be a resident of the complex and have a parking placard, if you don't you either need to park in the visitor designated parking area, or on the street. the one day, i went to work, and did some errands, how ever i took down the placard hanging from my rear view mirror so i could drive without it distracting me, and put it on the little shelf above my glove compartment. i got home after running errands, parked in the lot, and thought i put the placard back up.

i told myself i could make it the 4 days/3 nights until we went home without using the bathroom to shit, with my guts literally going to be able to piss in the water and pissing without losing control *finally*.
 i am somewhat oddly proud of the fact that i had made it a few days without shitting, but i could feel the pressure building and eventually i realized even letting go enough to piss was making me feel like i was about to shit at the same time. i am somewhat oddly proud of the fact that i had made it a few days without shitting, but i could feel the pressure building

anyway, he says to me "hey bro, let us get drinks on you, and we'll pay cash for your beer." obviously, i understood that he was trying to work out a deal to hop in line, however his phrasing matched with the fact that i'm not very trusting of seemingly shady assholes put me in a bit of a skeptic vibe.
 ok, i only realized what had happened after walking away, so i only realized that we were tricked together, and said 'oh..

well today she shows up at my door and hands me an envelope and says "its no big deal but i dont want your mom to worry this christmas" she tells me to give it to my mom and leaves.

i asked what he meant by "let me go." we were slow so i figured i could just leave early. he then said that i could go home early if i wanted but i just decided to work my last 30 minutes. i'm going to see if they can give me a second chance tomorrow because i really felt like i was doing a way better job than they thought i was.
-----:81
while doing this i actually start working on something important for my boss, so i start to ignore my friend.
-----:82
every other door is locked, and eventually i end up standing outside the building in my boxers. .they find my friend, knock on the door - mid-sex, for them - and he comes to the lobby, tells me i'm a massive dumbass, and gets me back into his room.
-----:83
well it changes quickly into a past sex life of theirs, now that should have been the point in time where i just noped the fuck on out of there, but i didn't.
-----:84
as i swing my arm out to start building momentum, she sits straight up on me. my arm moves around and i start the slight whip-like motion so that it i get a nice "pop" as my hand lands.
 after what felt like a lifetime, i was able to allow her to get off (not the way i had hoped).
-----:85
it turned into an all out sprint and i just couldn't run fast enough.
-----:86
she didn't even know that we were going to take another shot at this point, but we knew that she took a full shot onto the ground where we were slowly loading it onto the ground.
 she was so excited to get back to the store, and i was so excited to get back to the store, that i was so excited to get back to the store that i was so excited to get back to the store that i was so excited to get back to the store that i was so excited to get back to the store that i was so excited to get back to the store that i was so excited to get back to

so i trekked down to the shop to get cash out, and ended up talking to the cashier for about 40 minutes about his whole life story. i'd seen him around, spoken to him before, and we also had mutual friends, so i assumed he was a chill guy. i eventually messaged him later to say that his behaviour wasn't cool, and he said that i should've locked the door on the way out, and that he apologises for his nocturnal reflexes and that next time i can sit on the floor.
-----:88
we tried to see them twice last year and it didn't work out each time. he got stuck in really bad traffic and had no idea how long he'd take so i waited outside all the way through the concert. with retail being busy this time of year, i just didn't even double check the dates of the show. i even got special permission to leave work early to see the concert.
-----:89
so i pause the game and it shows the virus strain, what it looks like in the apes and humans, daily infections and deaths, and *oh god* the name big in the top left corner. i was gonna tell him it's not what it looks like but he starts walking away and says i really need to turn that off. without hesitation i delete the games progress, rename the virus to simian flu, and didn't make eye contact with the teacher for a week along with drawing attention to me.

i'm straining, i'm shimmying, i'm squeezing and pushing, all trying to get my little turd-baby moving. that's right, i'm digging in my own bung-hole to remove poop piece-by-bloody-mucus-covered-piece.

instead of us all doing a specific activity in our groups (we all do basketball or dodgeball or something) they instead decided to have us all do whatever we wanted out of a selection of things.

i woke up late for class because my alarm was set to 9 pm not am (i just got a new phone, sue me).
 i hadn't even watched that scene yet so i didn't know what was about to come. get your dick wet.*" i shut my computer immediately and it still wouldn't stop! and the voice continued in the same tone even though my laptop was shut. i threw it in my bag but you could still hear it for another 20 seconds before class or watch someone else watch it.

on the way to the woods was a small pond with benches which we'd often sit at post-smokening to enjoy our high. "oh fuck", leon covered his mouth with his hands, devastated by the rocky horror he'd personally unleashed on innocent duck honking, sending it to a premature, watery grave.
 i didn't mean to wait till the last of my friend's innocence. mouth still covered with the rocks, the duck's neck still covered with the rocks.

my wife and i were at the local wifi spot with some friends when i sent one to my wife pretending to be some dude and she instantly figured me out and we laughed it off. a few minutes go by and one of my best friends shows up, so i send him a message saying i (the imaginary sender) am an admirer of his on facebook and would like to see more.

these are the types of tests that they give you 30 minutes to do, all multiple choice (like 10 simple questions) and you can finish in 5 minutes tops. besides handing us out a test booklet and a pencil, we got a periodic table handout (have no fucking idea why we would need this, this is bio not chem). so, being bored even of my beautiful symmetrical lines, began to write down the lyrics to the song. i get fined 2 weeks ago and i'm not going to see a psychiatrist this week.

for starters my high school was a smaller off shoot of the main high school in my town which i went to because the public high school was wayyy over crowded, think 5,000 students in a building designed to accommodate 3,000, shit’s crazy, not to mention there is literally a pig farm behind the campus that the bigger school uses for ffa classes and we had a dirt and gravel parking lot. a minute later i’m walking toward my class and my hands get cold, so i put my hands in my pockets and start to feel around and realize that something in my pocket is rather slimy, then the smell goes from pigs to

.one day my two buddies and i went to go hangout with a couple of girls. my two buddies and i were waiting far enough away from the bathroom for our friends to finish showering. .after i moved away from the door my one buddy took his turn listening. .enjoy my (well kind of my friends) tifu if i fucked up; listen to the aftermath.

i get the hot chocolate and go about my day, feeling worse and worse as the day went on. i begin to say "my teacher told me to come call my parents to pick me up because i do not feel good." it was at this point, the principle walked out of her office and was standing in front of me.
