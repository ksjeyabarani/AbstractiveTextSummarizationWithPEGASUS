 TITLE II--CONFORMING AMENDMENTS TO OTHER LAWS; REFERENCES

Sec. 201. Conforming amendments to other laws.
Sec. 202. References.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 Congress finds the following:
 (1) As the world's largest economy, the United States has 
 an enormous stake in the future of the global trading system.
 (2) Exports are a crucial force driving the United States 
 economy and job creation.
 (3) While nearly 97 percent of United States exporters are 
 small and medium enterprises (SMEs), SMEs account for just over 
 one-fourth of exports, leaving much room for growth.
 (4) Two-thirds of United States exporters have fewer than 
 20 employees and sell to just one foreign market.
 (5) Manufacturers account for 61 percent of total United 
 States exports with small manufacturers accounting for 
 approximately 15 percent of total United States exports. Thirty 
 percent of small manufacturers do not currently export but 
 would consider doing so if they had more help in securing vital 
 information on foreign markets, customers, and export 
 procedures.
 (6) United States small and medium enterprises face tough 
 competition from trading partners of the United States that 
 aggressively undertake export promotion programs that directly 
 support and underwrite the expanded growth in trade of their 
 small and medium enterprises.
 (7) United States trade promotion is carried out in part by 
 21 departments and agencies of the Federal Government. 
 Representatives from these Federal departments and agencies are 
 members of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC), a 
 Federal committee that has not lived up to congressional intent 
 to provide a seamless offering of export promotion products and 
 services due in part to the inadequate allocation of resources 
 and a lack of ultimate decision making budget input authority 
 to ensure effective results are achieved for the invested 
 resources.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

 The purpose of this Act and the amendments made by this Act is to 
improve the performance and results of trade promotion policies and 
programs of the Federal Government in accordance with the Government 
Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-62).

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Medicare Dual Eligible Prescription 
Drug Coverage Act of 2005''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 The Senate finds the following:
 (1) Individuals who are dually eligible for benefits under 
 the medicare program and full benefits under the medicaid 
 program--
 (A) are among the most vulnerable populations in 
 our society; and
 (B) require adequate outreach, education, and 
 timing in order to adjust to changes in our health care 
 delivery system.
 (2) The transition of 6,400,000 dual eligibles from 
 prescription drug coverage under the medicaid program to 
 prescription drug coverage under part D of the medicare program 
 is the largest transition ever of individuals from one 
 insurance program to another.
 (3) In its June 2004 report to Congress, the Medicare 
 Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) suggested that large, 
 private employers with 75,000 employees or less need at least 6 
 months to transition their employees' drug coverage from one 
 pharmacy benefit management company to another such company. 
 The States and the Federal Government are taking on a far more 
 complex task with 6,400,000 dual eligibles having to make the 
 transition described in paragraph (2).
 (4) Timely access to prescription drugs leads to higher 
 quality of life and prevents avoidable emergency room visits, 
 hospitalizations, and premature nursing home placements.
 (5) Since even a short-term gap in prescription drug 
 coverage could have serious health consequences for dual 
 eligibles, Congress must work to guarantee as smooth a 
 transition as possible for dual eligibles so that no dual 
 eligible is without prescription drug coverage even for one 
 day.

SEC. 3. CONTINUING STATE COVERAGE OF MEDICAID PRESCRIPTION DRUG 
 COVERAGE TO MEDICARE DUAL ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES FOR 6 
 MONTHS.

 (a) Six-Month Transition.--For prescriptions filled during the 
period beginning on January 1, 2006, and ending on June 30, 2006, 
section 1935(d) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396u-5(d)) shall 
not apply and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State (as 
defined for purposes of title XIX of such Act) shall continue to 
provide (and receive Federal financial participation for) medical 
assistance under such title with respect to prescription drugs as if 
such section 1935(d) had not been enacted.
 (b) Application.--
 (1) Medicare as primary payer.--Nothing in subsection (a) 
 shall be construed as changing or affecting the primary payer 
 status of a prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan under part 
 D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act with respect to 
 prescription drugs furnished to any full-benefit dual eligible 
 individual (as defined in section 1935(c)(6) of such Act (42 
 U.S.C. 1396u-5(c)(6)) during the 6-month period described in 
 such subsection.
 (2) Third party liability.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall 
 be construed as limiting the authority or responsibility of a 
 State under section 1902(a)(25) of the Social Security Act (42 
 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25)) to seek reimbursement from a prescription 
 drug plan, an MA-PD plan, or any other third party, of the 
 costs incurred by the State in providing prescription drug 
 coverage described in such subsection.

SEC. 4. DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICAID CLAWBACK PAYMENTS.

 Notwithstanding section 1935(c) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1396u-5(c)), a State or the District of Columbia shall not be 
required to provide for a payment under such section to the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services for any month prior to July 1, 2006.

SEC. 5. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO DUAL ELIGIBLES REGARDING PRESCRIPTION 
 DRUG COVERAGE AND MONITORING OF THE TRANSITION OF DUAL 
 ELIGIBLES TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE.

 (a) MMA Amounts.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, of

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Repeal of Obamacare Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 Congress finds the following with respect to the impact of Public 
Law 111-148 and related provisions of Public Law 111-152 (collectively 
referred to in this section as  ⁇ the law''):
 (1) President Obama promised the American people that if 
 they liked their current health coverage, they could keep it. 
 But even the Obama Administration admits that tens of millions 
 of Americans are at risk of losing their health care coverage, 
 including as many as 8 in 10 plans offered by small businesses.
 (2) Despite projected spending of more than two trillion 
 dollars over the next 10 years, cutting Medicare by more than 
 one-half trillion dollars over that period, and increasing 
 taxes by over $800 billion dollars over that period, the law 
 does not lower health care costs. In fact, the law actually 
 makes coverage more expensive for millions of Americans. The 
 average American family already paid a premium increase of 
 approximately $1,200 in the year following passage of the law. 
 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that health 
 insurance premiums for individuals buying private health 
 coverage on their own will increase by $2,100 in 2016 compared 
 to what the premiums would have been in 2016 if the law had not 
 passed.
 (3) The law cuts more than one-half trillion dollars in 
 Medicare and uses the funds to create a new entitlement program 
 rather than to protect and strengthen the Medicare program. 
 Actuaries at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
 warn that the Medicare cuts contained in the law are so drastic 
 that  ⁇ providers might end their participation in the program 
 (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries)''. CBO 
 cautioned that the Medicare cuts  ⁇ might be difficult to 
 sustain over a long period of time''. According to the CMS 
 actuaries, 7.4 million Medicare beneficiaries who would have 
 been enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan in 2017 will lose 
 access to their plan because the law cuts $206 billion in 
 payments to Medicare Advantage plans. The Trustees of the 
 Medicare Trust Funds predict that the law will result in a 
 substantial decline in employer-sponsored retiree drug 
 coverage, and 90 percent of seniors will no longer have access 
 to retiree drug coverage by 2016 as a result of the law.
 (4) The law creates a 15-member, unelected Independent 
 Payment Advisory Board that is empowered to make binding 
 decisions regarding what treatments Medicare will cover and how 
 much Medicare will pay for treatments solely to cut spending, 
 restricting access to health care for seniors.
 (5) The law and the more than 13,000 pages of related 
 regulations issued before July 11, 2012, are causing great 
 uncertainty, slowing economic growth, and limiting hiring 
 opportunities for the approximately 13 million Americans 
 searching for work. Imposing higher costs on businesses will 
 lead to lower wages, fewer workers, or both.
 (6) The law imposes 21 new or higher taxes on American 
 families and businesses, including 12 taxes on families making 
 less than $250,000 a year.
 (7) While President Obama promised that nothing in the law 
 would fund elective abortion, the law expands the role of the 
 Federal Government in funding and facilitating abortion and 
 plans that cover abortion. The law appropriates billions of 
 dollars in new funding without explicitly prohibiting the use 
 of these funds for abortion, and it provides Federal subsidies 
 for health plans covering elective abortions. Moreover, the law 
 effectively forces millions of individuals to personally pay a 
 separate abortion premium in violation of their sincerely held 
 religious, ethical, or moral beliefs.
 (8) Until enactment of the law, the Federal Government has 
 not sought to impose specific coverage or care requirements 
 that infringe on the rights of conscience of insurers, 
 purchasers of insurance, plan sponsors, beneficiaries, and 
 other stakeholders, such as individual or institutional health 
 care providers. The law creates a new nationwide requirement 
 for health plans to cover  ⁇ essential health benefits'' and 
  ⁇ preventive services'', but does not allow stakeholders to opt 
 out of covering items or services to which they have a 
 religious or moral objection, in violation of the Religious 
 Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103-141). By creating new 
 barriers to health insurance and causing the loss of existing 
 insurance arrangements, these inflexible mandates jeopardize 
 the ability of institutions and individuals to exercise their 
 rights of conscience and their ability to freely participate in 
 the health insurance and health care marketplace.
 (9) The law expands Government control over health care, 
 adds trillions of dollars to existing liabilities,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Airline Passenger Fairness Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 The Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The number of airline passengers on United States 
 carriers is expected to grow from about 600 million per year 
 today to about 1 billion by the year 2008.
 (2) Since 1978 the number of certified large air carriers 
 has decreased from 30 to 10. In 1998, 6 of the United States' 
 largest air carriers sought to enter into arrangements that 
 would result in 3 large networks comprising approximately 70 
 percent of the domestic market.
 (3) Only  ⁇ 2/3 ⁇  of all communities in the United States that 
 had scheduled air service in 1978 still have it today, and  ⁇ 1/
 2 ⁇  of those remaining are served by smaller airlines feeding 
 hub airports.
 (4) The Department of Transportation's Domestic Airline 
 Fares Consumer Report for the 3rd Quarter of 1997 listed 75 
 major city pairs where fares increased by 30 percent or more 
 year-over-year, while total traffic in these city pairs 
 decreased by 863,500 passengers, or more than 20 percent.
 (5) A 1998 Department of Transportation study found that 
 large United States air carriers charge twice as much at their 
 large hub airports where there is no low fare competition as 
 they charge at a hub airport where a low fare competitor is 
 present. The General Accounting Office found that fares range 
 from 12 percent to 71 percent higher at hubs dominated by one 
 carrier or a consortium.
 (6) Complaints filed with the Department of Transportation 
 about airline travel have increased by more than 25 percent 
 over the previous year, and complaints against large United 
 States air carriers have increased from 6,394 in 1997 to 7,994 
 in 1998.
 (7) The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission 
 reported that recent data indicate the problem of delay in 
 flights is getting worse, and that the number of daily aircraft 
 delays of 15 minutes or longer was nearly 20 percent higher in 
 1996 than in 1995.
 (8) The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission 
 forecast that United States domestic and international 
 passenger enplanements are expected to increase 52 percent 
 between 1996 and 2006, and the Federal Aviation Administration 
 forecasts annual growth in revenue passenger miles will average 
 4.2 percent.
 (9) A 1998 Department of Transportation study found that 
 the large United States air carriers charge about 60 percent 
 more to passengers traveling to or from small communities than 
 they charge to passengers traveling between large communities.
 (10) The Congress has directed the Secretary of 
 Transportation to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in 
 the airline industry.

 the flight on which the passenger is ticketed is oversold;
  ⁇ (2) to permit a passenger holding a confirmed reserved 
 space on a flight to use portions of that passenger's ticket 
 for travel, rather than the entire ticket, regardless of the 
 reason any other portion of the ticket is not used;
  ⁇ (3) to deliver a passenger's checked baggage within 24 
 hours after arrival of the flight on which the passenger 
 travelled and on which the passenger checked the baggage, 
 except for reasonable delays in delivery of such baggage;
  ⁇ (4) to provide a consumer full access to all fares for 
 that air carrier, regardless of the technology the consumer 
 uses to access the fares if such information is requested by 
 that consumer;
  ⁇ (5) to provide notice to each passenger holding a 
 confirmed reserved space on a flight with reasonable prior 
 notice when a scheduled flight will be delayed for any reason 
 (other than reasons of national security);

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ United States-Israel Enhanced 
Security Cooperation Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
 Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) Since 1948, United States Presidents and both houses of 
 Congress, on a bipartisan basis and supported by the American 
 people, have repeatedly reaffirmed the special bond between the 
 United States and Israel, based on shared values and shared 
 interests.
 (2) The Middle East is undergoing rapid change, bringing with 
 it hope for an expansion of democracy but also great challenges to 
 the national security of the United States and our allies in the 
 region, particularly to our most important ally in the region, 
 Israel.
 (3) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
 continuing its decades-long pattern of seeking to foment 
 instability and promote extremism in the Middle East, particularly 
 in this time of dramatic political transition.
 (4) At the same time, the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
 Iran continues to enrich uranium in defiance of multiple United 
 Nations Security Council resolutions.
 (5) A nuclear-weapons capable Iran would fundamentally threaten 
 vital United States interests, encourage regional nuclear 
 proliferation, further empower Iran, the world's leading state 
 sponsor of terror, and pose a serious and destabilizing threat to 
 Israel and the region.
 (6) Over the past several years, with the assistance of the 
 Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Syria, Hizbollah 
 and Hamas have increased their stockpile of rockets, with more than 
 60,000 now ready to be fired at Israel. The Government of the 
 Islamic Republic of Iran continues to add to its arsenal of 
 ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, which threaten Iran's 
 neighbors, Israel, and United States Armed Forces in the region.
 (7) As a result, Israel is facing a fundamentally altered 
 strategic environment.
 (8) Pursuant to chapter 5 of title 1 of the Emergency Wartime 
 Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11; 117 Stat. 
 576), the authority to make available loan guarantees to Israel is 
 currently set to expire on September 30, 2012.
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
 It is the policy of the United States:
 (1) To reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the security of 
 the State of Israel as a Jewish state. As President Barack Obama 
 stated on December 16, 2011,  ⁇ America's commitment and my 
 commitment to Israel and Israel's security is unshakeable.'' And as 
 President George W. Bush stated before the Israeli Knesset on May 
 15, 2008, on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the State of 
 Israel,  ⁇ The alliance between our governments is unbreakable, yet 
 the source of our friendship runs deeper than any treaty.''.
 (2) To help the Government of Israel preserve its qualitative 
 military edge amid rapid and uncertain regional political 
 transformation.
 (3) To veto any one-sided anti-Israel resolutions at the United 
 Nations Security Council.
 (4) To support Israel's inherent right to self-defense.
 (5) To pursue avenues to expand cooperation with the Government 
 of Israel both in defense and across the spectrum of civilian 
 sectors, including high technology, agriculture, medicine, health, 
 pharmaceuticals, and energy.
 (6) To assist the Government of Israel with its ongoing efforts 
 to forge a peaceful, negotiated settlement of the Israeli-
 Palestinian conflict that results in two states living side-by-side 
 in peace and security, and to encourage Israel's neighbors to 
 recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state.
 (7) To encourage further development of advanced technology 
 programs between the United States and Israel given current trends 
 and instability in the region.
SEC. 4. UNITED STATES ACTIONS TO ASSIST IN THE DEFENSE OF ISRAEL AND 
PROTECT UNITED STATES INTERESTS.
 It is the sense of Congress that the United States Government 
should take the following actions to assist in the defense of Israel:
 (1) Seek to enhance the capabilities of the Governments of the 
 United States and Israel to address emerging common threats, 
 increase security cooperation, and expand joint military exercises.
 (2) Provide the Government of Israel such support as may be 
 necessary to increase development and production of joint missile 
 defense systems, particularly such systems that defend against the 
 urgent threat posed to Israel and United States forces in the 
 region.
 (3) Provide the Government of Israel assistance specifically 
 for the production and procurement of the Iron Dome defense system 
 for purposes of intercepting short-range missiles, rockets, and 
 projectiles launched against Israel.
 (4) Provide the Government of Israel defense articles and 
 defense services through such mechanisms as appropriate, to include 
 air refueling tankers, missile

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Immunization Now Act of 1993''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 The Congress finds, with respect to immunizations against vaccine-
preventable diseases, the following:
 (1) Childhood illnesses that can be prevented by timely 
 application of commonly available vaccinations, through a 
 program of Federal and local cooperation, are rising at an 
 alarming rate.
 (2) The incidence of measles increased 336 percent in 1989, 
 increasing to eighteen thousand one hundred ninety three cases 
 from three thousand three hundred ninety six in 1988.
 (3) The cost of appropriate immunizations is minimal. One 
 estimate places that cost at $130 per child.
 (4) The typical price per dose of a measles, mumps, rubella 
 vaccine is approximately $24 to the practitioner and the 
 average cost of hospitalization for a child with measles is 
 approximately $5,000-$6,000.
 (5) A child who was not immunized from measles died in a 
 California hospital after $800,000 was spent in an effort to 
 treat the child's measles complications.
 (6) In November 1990 the measles rate for the year had 
 already surpassed the rates of other full years since 1978 and 
 deaths from measles are the highest since 1971. Measles caused 
 more than sixty deaths in 1990, the largest annual number of 
 reported cases due to measles in almost two decades.
 (7) Fifty four percent of measles cases occur among 
 vaccine-eligible infants and preschool children who have not 
 been vaccinated.
 (8) One-third to one-half of children up to age two who 
 live in poor, inner-city areas are not properly immunized.
 (9) Preschool children in other Western, industrialized 
 nations have significantly higher immunization rates than 
 United States children of the same age group.
 (10) There are seven to nine million uninsured children in 
 the United States.
 (11) While programs to immunize school-aged children have 
 been very successful, preschoolers as a group now make up 47 
 percent of measles cases, up from 25 percent in 1988.
 (12) Computerized systems of tracking immunization status 
 and utilization from birth have been operationalized in several 
 countries, including Great Britain and the Netherlands. Such 
 systems can aid in surveillance of immunization status, 
 provision of reminders to parents when vaccines are due, and 
 monitoring the distribution of vaccines through public and 
 private providers.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM REGARDING IMMUNIZATION OF 
 INFANTS AGAINST VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES.

 (a) In General.--Each infant in the United States--
 (1) who has not reached the infant's second birthday,
 (2) who is a citizen or national of the United States, an 
 alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or other alien 
 permanently in the United States under color of law, and
 (3) who is not entitled under a health insurance policy or 
 other health benefit plan to receive (or have any payment made 
 for the expenses of) any immunization specified under section 
 7, is entitled to receive without charge, in accordance with 
 this Act, immunizations against vaccine-preventable diseases.
 (b) Implementation Through System of Vouchers.--The entitlement 
established in subsection (a) shall be implemented through the use of 
vouchers issued under section 5. Such vouchers represent the obligation 
of the Federal Government to pay, subject to section 6, the costs of 
providing the immunizations specified under section 7 for the infants 
for whom the vouchers are issued.

SEC. 4. OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE IMMUNIZATIONS.

 (a) In General.--Any licensed health care professional or provider 
who or which is authorized by law to provide immunizations specified 
under section 7 and who or which is engaged in the public or private 
practice of pediatrics or family medicine shall provide the 
immunizations specified under section 7 that are appropriate for the 
age of the infant involved if a voucher issued under section 5 for the 
infant is presented to the professional or provider.
 (b) Applicability.--The requirement established in subsection (a) 
shall apply to a professional or provider without regard to whether the 
professional or provider provides health services as a participant in 
the program established in title XVIII of the Social Security Act or 
the program established in title XIX of such Act, and without regard to 
whether the professional or provider otherwise receives Federal 
payments or Federal financial assistance for any purpose.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Department of Defense Privatization 
and Outsourcing Moratorium Act''.

SEC. 2. MORATORIUM ON PRIVATIZATION AND OUTSOURCING OF DEPARTMENT OF 
 DEFENSE FUNCTIONS.

 (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
 (1) There is conflicting evidence that the current 
 privatization and outsourcing efforts of the Department of 
 Defense, including the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air 
 Force, are reducing the cost of support functions within the 
 Department.
 (2) Typically, these privatization and outsourcing efforts 
 result in contractors simply replacing civilian employees of 
 the Department at lower initial costs, but higher longer-term 
 costs, while stagnating organizational improvements that would 
 otherwise result in greater efficiencies and effectiveness.
 (3) Recent and current privatization and outsourcing 
 efforts in some cases appear to have created serious oversight 
 and accountability problems for the Department.
 (4) The Department, as a general practice, has adjusted the 
 operating budgets of the Armed Forces and specific military 
 installations to reflect savings anticipated as a result of 
 Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 studies and 
 subsequent privatization and outsourcing activities.
 (5) The massive drawdowns in the size of the Armed Forces 
 during the 1990's and the restructuring of military 
 installations through the base closure process have created a 
 climate in which making accurate decisions concerning 
 privatization and outsourcing are further complicated due to 
 the dynamic nature of the civilian workforce of the Department.
 (6) The Department should pursue alternatives to the 
 privatization and outsourcing approach conducted under the A-76 
 process, such as  ⁇ Strategic Sourcing'', to find its most 
 efficient organization to perform commercial or industrial type 
 functions.
 (b) Moratorium.--(1) Chapter 146 of title 10, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the following new section:
 ⁇ Sec. 2475. Moratorium on privatization and outsourcing
  ⁇ (a) Moratorium.--(1) During the period specified in subsection 
(b), any commercial or industrial type function of the Department of 
Defense that, as of the date of the enactment of this section, is being 
performed by Department of Defense civilian employees may not be 
changed to performance by the private sector.
  ⁇ (2) The moratorium applies to a function even though, as of the 
date of the enactment of this section, the function--
  ⁇ (A) is the subject of a study or report under section 
 2461 of this title for conversion to contractor performance; or
  ⁇ (B) is being considered for such conversion under the 
 procedures and requirements of Office of Management and Budget 
 Circular A-76.
  ⁇ (3) As part of the moratorium, the Secretary of Defense shall 
order the suspension of any study being conducted under section 2461 of 
this title or Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 regarding a 
commercial or industrial type function of the Department. New studies 
regarding such a function at a military installation may not be 
commenced under such section or circular during the period of the 
moratorium.
  ⁇ (b) Duration of Moratorium.--The moratorium imposed under 
subsection (a) begins on the date of the enactment of this section and 
shall continue until the end of the five-year period beginning on the 
date the Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that all actions 
necessary to carry out the 1995 round of base closures and realignments 
have been completed under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act 
of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 
note).
  ⁇ (c) Exception.--The moratorium imposed under subsection (a) does 
not apply to a commercial or industrial type function of the Department 
of Defense that is being converted, or is being considered for 
conversion, to performance by the private sector under a Strategic 
Sourcing or Business Process and Re-engineering plan of the Department.
  ⁇ (d) Report Evaluating Conversion to Contractor Performance.--(1) 
Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this 
section, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report 
evaluating--
  ⁇ (A) each conversion of a commercial or industrial type 
 function of the Department of Defense to contractor performance 
 that was carried out, in whole or in part, since October 1, 
 1996; and
  ⁇ (B) each commercial or industrial type function of the 
 Department that was considered, since that date, for conversion 
 to contractor performance under section 2461 of this title or

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

 The Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The Congress has previously directed the Secretary of 
 Defense to seek to enter into multiyear burden sharing support 
 agreements with economically strong North Atlantic Treaty 
 Organization (NATO) allies of the United States in order to 
 obtain increased host nation contributions toward defraying the 
 overseas basing costs for forces of the Armed Forces of the 
 United States in that host country.
 (2) In fiscal year 1992--
 (A) the government of Germany contributed 
 approximately 23 percent of the overseas basing costs 
 for United States forces in that country;
 (B) the government of Italy contributed 
 approximately 20 percent of the overseas basing costs 
 for United States forces in that country;
 (C) the government of the United Kingdom 
 contributed approximately 14 percent of the overseas 
 basing costs for United States forces in that country; 
 and
 (D) the United States paid the remainder of such 
 costs.
 (3) The Japanese government will pay 75.1 percent of 
 overseas basing costs according to the host nation burden 
 sharing support agreement between the United States and Japan.
 (4) In accordance with that agreement, the government of 
 Japan contributed in fiscal year 1992 approximately 70 percent 
 of the overseas basing costs for United States forces in that 
 country, and the United States paid the remainder of such 
 costs.
 (5) If the economically strong NATO allies of the United 
 States had contributed 75 percent of the overseas basing costs 
 that were incurred for fiscal year 1992 for United States 
 forces in the countries of such allies, the United States would 
 have saved an estimated $5,000,000,000 of the amount paid by 
 the United States for overseas basing costs for that fiscal 
 year.
 (6) It is in the national interest of the United States for 
 the United States and our economically strong allies to enter 
 into burden sharing support agreements that provide for such 
 allies to defray most or all of the overseas basing costs for 
 the United States forces stationed in the allied countries.

SEC. 2. INCREASED BURDEN SHARING BY ALLIES OF THE UNITED STATES.

 (a) Defense Cost-Sharing Agreements.--The President shall enter 
into negotiations with each foreign nation described in subsection 
(b)(1) to seek to conclude an agreement that provides for such nation 
to pay at least 75 percent of the overseas basing costs that are 
incurred for the stationing of members of the Armed Forces of the 
United States and related civilian employees of the Department of 
Defense in that nation as a result of the implementation of a bilateral 
or multilateral defense agreement with that nation.
 (b) Covered Foreign Nations.--
 (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
 foreign nations referred to in subsection (a) are the 
 following:
 (A) Each member nation of the North Atlantic Treaty 
 Organization (other than the United States).
 (B) Every other foreign nation with which the 
 United States has a bilateral or multilateral defense 
 agreement that provides for the assignment of combat 
 units of the Armed Forces of the United States to 
 permanent duty ashore in that nation or the placement

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Promoting Human Rights by Ending 
Israeli Military Detention of Palestinian Children Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 Congress finds the following:
 (1) Israel ratified the Convention on the Rights of the 
 Child on October 3, 1991, which states--
 (A) in article 37(a), that  ⁇ no child shall be 
 subject to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
 treatment or punishment'';
 (B) in article 37(b), that the arrest, detention or 
 imprisonment of a child  ⁇ shall be used only as a 
 measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate 
 period of time'';
 (C) in article 37(c), that  ⁇ every child deprived 
 of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect 
 for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a 
 manner which takes into account the needs of persons of 
 his or her age''; and
 (D) in article 37(d), that  ⁇ [e]very child deprived 
 of his or her liberty shall have the right to prompt 
 access to legal and other appropriate assistance, as 
 well as the right to challenge the legality of the 
 deprivation of his or her liberty before a court or 
 other competent, independent and impartial authority, 
 and to a prompt decision on any such action''.
 (2) In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, there are two 
 separate legal systems, with Israeli military law imposed on 
 Palestinians and Israeli civilian law applied to Israeli 
 settlers.
 (3) The Israeli military detains around 500 to 700 
 Palestinian children between the ages of 12 and 17 each year 
 and prosecutes them before a military court system that lacks 
 basic and fundamental guarantees of due process in violation of 
 international standards.
 (4) Approximately 2,700,000 Palestinians live in the West 
 Bank, of which around 47 percent are children under the age of 
 18, who live under military occupation, the constant fear of 
 arrest, detention, and violence by the Israeli military, and 
 the threat of recruitment by armed groups.
 (5) Since 2000, an estimated 10,000 Palestinian children 
 have been detained by Israeli security forces in the West Bank 
 and prosecuted in the Israeli military court system.
 (6) Children under the age of 12 cannot be prosecuted in 
 Israeli military courts. However, Israeli military forces 
 detain children under the age of 12 and question them, for 
 several hours, before releasing them to their families or to 
 Palestinian authorities.
 (7) Human Rights Watch documented, in a July 2015 report 
 titled  ⁇ Israel: Security Forces Abuse Palestinian Children'', 
 that such detentions also included the use of chokeholds, 
 beatings, and coercive interrogation on children between the 
 ages of 11 and 15 years.
 (8) The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) concluded, 
 in a February 2013 report titled  ⁇ Children in Israeli Military 
 Detention'', that the  ⁇ ill-treatment of children who come in 
 contact with the military detention system appears to be 
 widespread, systematic and institutionalized throughout the 
 process, from the moment of arrest until the child's 
 prosecution and eventual conviction and sentencing''.
 (9) The 2013 UNICEF report further determines that the 
 Israeli system of military detention of Palestinian children 
 profoundly deviates from international norms, stating that  ⁇ in 
 no other country are children systematically tried by juvenile 
 military courts that, by definition, fall short of providing 
 the necessary guarantees to ensure respect for their rights''.
 (10) UNICEF also released reports in October 2013 and 
 February 2015 noting that Israeli authorities have, since March 
 2013, issued new military orders and taken steps to reinforce 
 existing military and police standard operating procedures 
 relating to the detention of Palestinian children. However, the 
 reports still found continued and persistent evidence of ill-
 treatment of Palestinian children detained by Israeli forces.
 (11) In 2013, the annual Country Report on Human Rights 
 Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories ( ⁇ Annual 
 Report'') published by the Department of State noted that 
 Israeli security services continued to abuse, and in some cases 
 torture minors, frequently arrested on suspicion of stone-
 throwing, in order to coerce confessions. The torture tactics 
 used included threats, intimidation, long-term handcuffing, 
 beatings, and solitary confinement.
 (12) The 2013 Annual Report also stated that  ⁇ signed 
 confessions by Palestinian minors, written in Hebrew, a 
 language most could not read, continued to be used as evidence 
 against them in Israeli military courts''.
 (13) The 2016 Annual Report noted a  ⁇ significant increase 
 in detention

their communities by providing--

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Breast Cancer and Environmental 
Research Act of 2001''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 The Congress finds as follows:
 (1) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer 
 deaths among American women.
 (2) More women in the United States are living with breast 
 cancer than any other cancer (excluding skin cancer). 
 Approximately 3,000,000 women in the United States are living 
 with breast cancer, 2,000,000 of which have been diagnosed and 
 an estimated 1,000,000 who do not yet know that they have the 
 disease.
 (3) Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer 
 among women in the United States and worldwide (excluding skin 
 cancer). In 2001, it is estimated that 233,000 new cases of 
 breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United 
 States, 192,000 cases of which will involve invasive breast 
 cancer and 40,800 cases of which will involve ductal carcinoma 
 in situ (DCIS).
 (4) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer 
 death for women in the United States. Approximately 40,000 
 women in the United States die from the disease each year. 
 Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women in 
 the United States between the ages of 20 and 59, and the 
 leading cause of cancer death for women worldwide.
 (5) A woman in the United States has a 1 in 8 chance of 
 developing invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. This risk 
 was 1 in 11 in 1975. In 2001, a new case of breast cancer will 
 be diagnosed every 2 minutes and a woman will die from breast 
 cancer every 13 minutes.
 (6) All women are at risk for breast cancer. About 90 
 percent of women who develop breast cancer do not have a family 
 history of the disease.
 (7) The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer, a public 
 private partnership, has recognized the importance of expanding 
 the scope and breadth of biomedical, epidemiological, and 
 behavioral research activities related to the etiology of 
 breast cancer and the role of the environment.
 (8) To date, there has been only a limited research 
 investment to expand the scope or coordinate efforts across 
 disciplines or work with the community to study the role of the 
 environment in the development of breast cancer.
 (9) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous 
 potential for avenues of prevention, the Federal investment in 
 the role of the environment and the development of breast 
 cancer should be expanded.
 (10) In order to understand the effect of chemicals and 
 radiation on the development of cancer, multi-generational, 
 prospective studies are probably required.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ America's Youth Commission Act of 
2001''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 Congress finds the following:
 (1) American youth, up to 18 years of age, represent the 
 freest, most educated, most affluent generation this Nation has 
 known. A majority will graduate from high school, will come 
 from families in which the parents or guardians are employed 
 and own property, and will come from a society which has 
 achieved unparalleled national economic and social opportunity 
 in a world largely at peace.
 (2) The potential for this generation of American youth to 
 make lasting contributions to freedom's cause is unparalleled. 
 Yet, despite this favorable domestic and international climate, 
 some serious flaws have appeared in America's social and 
 cultural fabric, characterized by destructive behaviors among 
 some of our youth that are damaging our Nation and the ability 
 of this generation to achieve its full potential.
 (3) While most of America's youth are achieving 
 academically and developing wholesome constructive pursuits, 
 youth violence in places like Littleton, Colorado, Springfield, 
 Oregon, and Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the rash of copycat 
 incidents, threatened or real, across the Nation has brought to 
 the fore a troubling lack of respect by some for other 
 individuals that lies at the heart of a free society.
 (4) Across our Nation, school  ⁇ pranks'' have in many cases 
 been destructive to schools and property and reveal a serious 
 lack of understanding by the perpetrators of the true costs of 
 their actions.
 (5) Equally serious are the consistently high and 
 personally destructive levels of alcohol and drug use by 
 American youth, sometimes coupled with gun violence, as well as 
 increasing levels of teenage suicide and eating disorders, such 
 as bulimia and anorexia.
 (6) Upholding human dignity faces challenges in the media 
 as well. By the time children in the United States have passed 
 through the eighth grade, they will have witnessed an average 
 of 8,000 murders and over 100,000 other acts of violence 
 through the media. In addition, many video games, music, films, 
 and Internet websites present material so degrading to human 
 dignity that they undermine the value of human life and elevate 
 the bizarre to normal. Some have characterized this as a 
  ⁇ culture of death'' that permeates the consciousness of 
 American youth.
 (7) The structure of family, neighborhoods, work, and 
 community in the United States has been transformed in the last 
 30 years as economic growth and mobility have impacted 
 families' aspirations and livelihoods. The static purchasing 
 power of families, mergers, and dislocation of production, 
 higher family mobility and suburbanization, rising levels of 
 foster children, all have contributed to a more fluid social 
 structure and less continuity for youth in permanent nurturing 
 relationships with family and community. The social 
 consequences of these changes, along with the pervasive 
 influence of media, demand attention, for developmental 
 attachments by adults toward youth that characterized previous 
 generations have become more tenuous in today's society.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.

 There is established a commission to be known as the  ⁇ National 
Commission on the Impact of United States Culture on America's Youth'' 
(hereinafter in this Act referred to as the  ⁇ Commission'').

SEC. 4. DUTY OF COMMISSION.

recommendations with respect to--
 (1) the condition and status of contemporary youth in 
 America compared to prior generations, with particular 
 attention to family, neighborhood, schools, scholastic 
 attainment, work, and community involvement;
 (2) the nature, origins, and trends of antisocial and 
 violent behavior among American youth, including--
 (A) an analysis of the trends in violent acts in 
 families, neighborhoods, and schools; and
 (B) the influence of organizations, other cultural 
 elements, and individuals contributing to the 
 incitement or encouragement of violent behaviors;
 (3) identification of successful initiatives that involve 
 youth in positive development and experiences that curb 
 antisocial behavior among youth;
 (4) recommendations for averting and reducing violence 
 among American youth; and
 (5) recommendations for parents, families, nongovernmental 
 and private sector organizations and Federal, State, and local 
 authorities in building positive developmental experiences 
 among American youth.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A MISCELLANEOUS TARIFF BILL.

 (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
 Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States imposes duties 
 on imported goods for which there is no domestic availability 
 or insufficient domestic availability.
 (2) The imposition of duties on such goods creates 
 artificial distortions in the economy of the United States that 
 negatively affect United States manufacturers and consumers.
 (3) It is in the interests of the United States to update 
 the Harmonized Tariff Schedule every 3 years to eliminate such 
 artificial distortions by suspending or reducing duties on such 
 goods.
 (4) The manufacturing competitiveness of the United States 
 around the world will be enhanced if Congress regularly and 
 predictably updates the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to suspend 
 or reduce duties on such goods.
 (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, to remove 
the competitive disadvantage to United States manufactures and 
consumers resulting from an outdated Harmonized Tariff Schedule and to 
promote the competitiveness of United States manufacturers, Congress 
should consider a miscellaneous tariff bill not later than 180 days

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Protection of Homes, Small 
Businesses, and Private Property Act of 2005''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 Congress finds the following:
 (1) The protection of homes, small businesses, and other 
 private property rights against government seizures and other 
 unreasonable government interference is a fundamental principle 
 and core commitment of our Nation's Founders.
 (2) As Thomas Jefferson wrote on April 6, 1816, the 
 protection of such rights is  ⁇ the first principle of 
 association, the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of 
 his industry, and the fruits acquired by it''.
 (3) The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution 
 specifically provides that  ⁇ private property'' shall not  ⁇ be 
 taken for public use without just compensation''.
 (4) The Fifth Amendment thus provides an essential 
 guarantee of liberty against the abuse of the power of eminent 
 domain, by permitting government to seize private property only 
  ⁇ for public use''.
 (5) On June 23, 2005, the United States Supreme Court 
 issued its decision in Kelo v. City of New London, No. 04-108.
 (6) As the Court acknowledged,  ⁇ it has long been accepted 
 that the sovereign may not take the property of A for the sole 
 purpose of transferring it to another private party B'', and 
 that under the Fifth Amendment, the power of eminent domain may 
 be used only  ⁇ for public use''.
 (7) The Court nevertheless held, by a 5-4 vote, that 
 government may seize the home, small business, or other private 
 property of one owner, and transfer that same property to 
 another private owner, simply by concluding that such a 
 transfer would benefit the community through increased economic 
 development.
 (8) The Court's decision in Kelo is alarming because, as 
 Justice O'Connor accurately noted in her dissenting opinion, 
 joined by the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas, the 
 Court has  ⁇ effectively . . . delete[d] the words  ⁇ for public 
 use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment'' and 
 thereby  ⁇ refus[ed] to enforce properly the Federal 
 Constitution''.
 (9) Under the Court's decision in Kelo, Justice O'Connor 
 warns,  ⁇ [t]he specter of condemnation hangs over all property. 
 Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with 
 a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with 
 a factory''.
 (10) Justice O'Connor further warns that, under the Court's 
 decision in Kelo,  ⁇ [a]ny property may now be taken for the 
 benefit of another private party'', and  ⁇ the fallout from this 
 decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be 
 those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the 
 political process, including large corporations and development 
 firms. As for the victims, the government now has license to 
 transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with 
 more. The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result''.
 (11) As an amicus brief filed by the National Association 
 for the Advancement of Colored People, AARP, and other 
 organizations noted,  ⁇ [a]bsent a true public use requirement 
 the takings power will be employed more frequently. The takings 
 that result will disproportionately affect and harm the 
 economically disadvantaged and, in particular, racial and 
 ethnic minorities and the elderly''.
 (12) It is appropriate for Congress to take action, 
 consistent with its limited powers under the Constitution, to 
 restore the vital protections of the Fifth Amendment and to 
 protect homes, small businesses, and other private property 
 rights against unreasonable government use of the power of 
 eminent domain.
 (13) It would also be appropriate for States to take action 
 to voluntarily limit their own power of eminent domain. As the 
 Court in Kelo noted,  ⁇ nothing in our opinion precludes any 
 State from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the 
 takings power''.

SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF HOMES, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND OTHER PRIVATE 
 PROPERTY RIGHTS.

 (a) In General.--The power of eminent domain shall be available 
only for public use.
 (b) Public Use.--In this Act, the term  ⁇ public use'' shall not be 
construed to include economic development.
 (c) Application.--This Act shall apply to--

 prevent conflict in the long term.
 (2) An interagency framework to plan, coordinate, and 
 execute all diplomatic economic, intelligence, and military 
 elements of United States policy across the region regarding 
 the Lord's Resistance Army.
 (3) A description of the type and form of diplomatic

 Tripartite Plus Commission and the Great Lakes Pact, and to 
 coordinate the implementation of United States policy toward 
 the Lord's Resistance Army across the region.
 (4) A description of how this engagement will fit within 
 the context of broader efforts and policy objectives in the 
 Great Lakes Region.
 (5) A framework to evaluate the progress and effectiveness 
 of the United States strategy toward eliminating the threat 
 posed by the Lord's Resistance Army.
 (c) Form.--The strategy under this section shall be submitted in 
unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.

SEC. 5. HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR AREAS OUTSIDE UGANDA AFFECTED BY 
 THE LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY.

 (a) Authority.--In accordance with section 491 of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2292) and section 2 of the Migration 
and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 (22 U.S.C. 2601), the President is 
authorized to provide assistance to respond to the humanitarian needs 
of populations in northeastern Congo, southern Sudan, and Central 
African Republic affected by the activity of the Lord's Resistance 
Army.
 (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 to carry out this 
section.

SEC. 6. ASSISTANCE FOR RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION IN NORTHERN UGANDA.

 (a) Authority.--It is the sense of Congress that the President 
should support efforts by the people of northern Uganda and the 
Government of Uganda--
 (1) to assist internally displaced people in transition and 
 returnees to secure durable solutions by spurring economic 
 revitalization, supporting livelihoods, helping to alleviate 
 poverty, and advancing access to basic services at return 
 sites, specifically clean water, health care, and schools;
 (2) to enhance the accountability and administrative 
 competency of local governance institutions and public agencies 
 in northern Uganda with regard to budget management, provision 
 of public goods and services, and related oversight functions;
 (3) to strengthen the operational capacity of the civilian 
 police in northern Uganda to enhance public safety, prevent 
 crime, and deal sensitively with gender-based violence, while 
 strengthening accountability measures to prevent corruption and 
 abuses;
 (4) to rebuild and improve the capacity of the justice 
 system in northern Uganda, including the courts and penal 
 systems, with particular sensitivity to the needs and rights of 
 women and children;
 (5) to establish mechanisms for the disarmament, 
 demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants, 
 including vocational education and employment opportunities; 
 and
 (6) to promote programs to address psychosocial trauma, 
 particularly post-traumatic stress disorder.
 (b) Future Year Funding.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of State and Administrator of the United States Agency for 
International Development should work with the appropriate committees 
of Congress to increase assistance in future fiscal years to support 
activities described in this section if the Government of Uganda 
demonstrates a commitment to transparent and accountable reconstruction 
in war-affected areas of northern

SECTION 1. GRANT PROGRAM FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS.

 (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Gifted and 
Talented Students Education Act of 2003''.
 (b) Amendment.--Subpart 6 of part D of title V of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7253 et seq.) is amended 
by adding at the end the following:

  ⁇ Chapter B--Grant Program For Gifted and Talented Students

 ⁇ SEC. 5467. FINDINGS; ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM; AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES.

  ⁇ (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
  ⁇ (1) Gifted and talented students give evidence of high 
 performance capability in specific academic fields, or in areas 
 such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership 
 capacity, and require services or activities not ordinarily 
 provided by a school in order to fully develop such 
 capabilities. Gifted and talented students are from all 
 cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic 
 groups. Some such students have disabilities and for some, 
 English is not their first language. Many students from such 
 diverse backgrounds have been historically underrepresented in 
 gifted education programs.
  ⁇ (2) Elementary school students who are gifted and 
 talented have already mastered 35 to 50 percent of the material 
 covered in a school year in several subject areas before the 
 school year begins.
  ⁇ (3) Elementary school and secondary school teachers have 
 students in their classrooms with a wide variety of traits, 
 characteristics, and needs. Most teachers receive some training 
 to meet the needs of these students, such as students with 
 limited English proficiency, students with disabilities, and 
 students from diverse cultural and racial backgrounds. However, 
 most teachers do not receive training on meeting the needs of 
 students who are gifted and talented.
  ⁇ (4) While the families or communities of some gifted 
 students can provide private programs with appropriately 
 trained staff to supplement public educational offerings, most 
 high-ability students, especially those from inner cities, 
 rural communities, or low-income families, must rely on the 
 services and personnel provided by public schools. Therefore, 
 gifted education programs, provided by qualified professionals 
 in the public schools, are needed to provide equal educational 
 opportunities.
  ⁇ (5) Parents and families are essential partners to 
 schools in developing appropriate educational services for 
 gifted and talented students. They need access to information, 
 research, and support regarding the characteristics of gifted 
 children and their educational, and social and emotional needs, 
 as well as information on available strategies and resources 
 for education in State and local communities.
  ⁇ (6) There currently is no Federal requirement to identify 
 or serve the Nation's approximately 3,000,000 gifted and 
 talented students.
  ⁇ (7) While some States and local educational agencies 
 allocate resources to educate gifted and talented students, 
 others do not. Additionally, State laws, and State and local 
 funding, identification, and accountability mechanisms vary 
 widely, resulting in a vast disparity of services for this 
 special-needs population.
  ⁇ (8) To meet the future economic and national security 
 needs of the United States, it is important that more students 
 achieve to higher levels, and that highly capable students 
 receive an education that prepares them to perform the most 
 highly innovative and creative work that is necessary to secure 
 our Nation's position in the world.
  ⁇ (9) The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in 
 the United States on the Third International Mathematics and 
 Science Study (TIMSS) was among the lowest in the world. In 
 each of 5 physics content areas in the study and in each of 3 
 mathematics content areas in the study, the performance of 
 physics and advanced mathematics students in the United States 
 was among the lowest of the participating countries.
  ⁇ (10) In 1990, fewer than 2 cents out of every $100 spent 
 on elementary and secondary education in the United States was 
 devoted to providing challenging programming for the Nation's 
 gifted and talented students.
  ⁇ (b) Program Authorized.--
  ⁇ (1) Competitive grants to states.--If the amount 
 appropriated under section 5468 for a fiscal year is greater 
 than $7,500,000 but less than $57,500,000, then the Secretary 
 may use such amount to award grants, on a competitive basis, to 
 State educational agencies to enable the State educational 
 agencies to award grants to local educational agencies under 
 section 5467C for developing or expanding gifted and talented 
 education programs, and providing direct educational services 
 and materials.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ United Nations Rapid Deployment Act 
of 2001''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 The Congress finds the following:
 (1) The December 1999 United Nations  ⁇ Report on the 
 Independent Inquiry into the Actions of the United Nations 
 During the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda'' indicates that in April 
 1994, the United Nations Security Council failed to deploy 
 5,500 United Nations peacekeepers to Rwanda within two weeks of 
 the initial violence, thereby allowing the conflict to 
 escalate. The six-month estimated cost of the deployment would 
 have been $115,000,000. Instead, the genocide consumed 800,000 
 lives along with $2,000,000,000 in humanitarian aid.
 (2) The April 2000 report of the United Nations Secretary 
 General,  ⁇ We the Peoples, The Role of the United Nations in 
 the 21st Century'', states that only member nations of the 
 United Nations can fix the structural weakness of United 
 Nations peace operations. The report compares the current 
 system for launching peacekeeping operations to a volunteer 
 fire department that has to find fire engines and the funds to 
 run them before starting to douse any flames. The present 
 United Nations system relies almost entirely on last minute, ad 
 hoc arrangements that guarantee delay, with respect to the 
 provision of civilian personnel even more so than military 
 personnel. Availability and readiness of forces is very 
 unpredictable and constraints on resources preclude rapid 
 deployment.
 (3) In August 2000, the specially-appointed panel on United 
 Nations Peace Operations issued its findings. Known as the 
  ⁇ Brahimi Report'' (A/55/305; S/2000/809), the report concludes 
 that  ⁇ few of the basic building blocks are in place for the 
 United Nations to rapidly acquire and deploy the human and 
 material resources required to mount any complex peace 
 operation in the future''. These building blocks include a 
 standing police corps, a reserve corps of mission leadership, a 
 sufficient stockpile of equipment, and arrangements for 
 recruitment of civilian personnel. Furthermore, the report 
 encourages member nations to enter partnerships with one 
 another in the context of the United Nations Stand-by 
 Arrangements System (UNSAS). These partnerships would form the 
 basis for Rapid Deployment Brigades (RDBs), which would develop 
 the operational capabilities to fully deploy  ⁇ traditional'' 
 peacekeeping operations within 30 days of the adoption of an 
 authorizing Security Council resolution and to fully deploy 
  ⁇ complex'' peacekeeping operations within 90 days of the 
 adoption of an authorizing Security Council resolution.
 (4) Former United States Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke, 
 speaking before the United Nations Security Council on November 
 15, 2000, stated that  ⁇ [u]nless we move decisively on 
 meaningful peacekeeping reform, those that threaten 
 peacekeepers across the globe may draw the conclusion that the 
 UN lacks the will, the cohesion and even the capability to 
 perform its essential peacekeeping function''.
 (5) Both the nations of Europe and the United States have 
 recognized the value and need for rapidly deployable combat 
 units in response to a full spectrum of contingencies, 
 including peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, low-
 intensity conflicts, and full-scale warfare. The European Union 
 has proposed forming a standing police force and rapid 
 deployment brigades as part of the European Defense Force, and 
 in the United States, the Department of Defense is establishing 
 interim brigade combat teams as part of the overall Army 
 transformation strategy.
 (6) The United States' veto power in the United Nations 
 Security Council gives it the capacity to halt the deployment 
 of United Nations forces if the deployment is not in the 
 national interests of the United States.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNITED NATIONS RAPID DEPLOYMENT POLICE AND 
 SECURITY FORCE.

 (a) Establishment.--The President shall direct the United States 
representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and 
influence of the United States to urge the United Nations--

 (A) is rapidly deployable under the authority of 
 the United Nations Security Council;
 (B) should be able to deploy within 15 days of a 
 United Nations Security Council resolution to establish 
 international peace operations;
 (C) is limited to a maximum deployment of six 
 months for any given mission;
 (D) should be deployed only when the United Nations 
 Security Council determines that violations of human

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND TABLE OF CONTENTS.

 (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Acid Rain and 
Mercury Control Act''.
 (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title and table of contents.
Sec. 2. Findings and purposes.
Sec. 3. Reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from 
 powerplants.
Sec. 4. Mercury emission reductions.
Sec. 5. Effect on other law.
Sec. 6. Protecting sensitive regional ecosystems.
Sec. 7. Authorization of appropriations.
Sec. 8. Modernization.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

 (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
 (1) reductions of atmospheric sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
 oxide from utility plants, in addition to the reductions 
 required under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), are 
 needed to reduce acid deposition and its serious adverse 
 effects on public health, natural resources, building 
 structures, sensitive ecosystems, and visibility;
 (2) sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide contribute to the 
 development of fine particulates, suspected of causing human 
 mortality and morbidity to a significant extent;
 (3) regional nitrogen oxide reductions of 75 percent in the 
 Eastern United States, in addition to the reductions required 
 under the Clean Air Act, may be necessary to protect sensitive 
 watersheds from the effects of nitrogen deposition;
 (4) since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were 
 enacted, some acidic lakes in the Adirondacks in the State of 
 New York have started to slowly show chemical recovery from 
 acid rain, demonstrating that sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
 regulations can be implemented in a cost-effective manner, but 
 the recovery is progressing at a slower rate than originally 
 intended;
 (5) nitrogen oxide is highly mobile and can lead to ozone 
 formation hundreds of miles from the emitting source;
 (6) on March 10, 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency 
 (EPA) issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to require 
 additional reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in 
 28 Eastern States and the District of Columbia;
 (7) these reductions represent approximately a 70 percent 
 reduction in sulfur dioxide and a 60 percent reduction in 
 nitrogen oxide in the affected States;
 (8) on July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals 
 for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated CAIR and on 
 December 23, 2008, the same court remanded the rule back to the 
 EPA without vacature;
 (9) fossil fuel-fired electric generating units emit 
 approximately  ⁇ 1/3 ⁇  of the total mercury emissions in the 
 United States;
 (10) mercury is considered a neurotoxin which can 
 bioaccumulate as it moves its way up the food chain and is 
 especially harmful to young children and developing fetuses;
 (11) according to the EPA, there were 3,080 fish advisories 
 for mercury in 2006; there are over 90 fish advisories for 
 mercury in New York alone, with blanket warning for the 
 Adirondack and Catskill Mountains;
 (12) on March 15, 2005, EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury 
 Rule (CAMR), which for the first time sought to regulate 
 mercury emissions from power plants, but used a less 
 restrictive cap-and-trade approach for this very harmful 
 substance and would take a full decade to implement;
 (13) on February 8, 2008, the United States Court of 
 Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated CAMR; and
 (14) on February 23, 2009, the Supreme Court denied a 
 request to reconsider the decision.
 (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
 (1) to recognize the current scientific understanding that 
 emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, and the acid 
 deposition resulting from emissions of sulfur dioxide and 
 nitrogen oxide, present a substantial human health and 
 environmental risk;
 (2) to require reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
 oxide emissions;
 (3) to support the efforts of existing acid rain and 
 mercury monitoring programs located throughout the country;
 (4) to reduce utility emissions of nitrogen oxide by 75 
 percent from 1997 levels;
 (5) to reduce utility emissions of sulfur dioxide by 75 
 percent after the implementation of phase II sulfur dioxide 
 requirements under section 405 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
 7651d); and
 (6) to adopt a strict standard for mercury emissions by 
 power plants of 0.6 pounds per trillion Btu without allowing 
 for a cap-and-trade system.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the  ⁇ Small Business, Family Farms, and 
Constitutional Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

 (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
 (1) The provision of the Departments of Veterans Affairs 
 and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies 
 Appropriations Act, 1999, that prohibits the use of Federal 
 funds to implement the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations 
 Framework Convention on Climate Change prior to its 
 ratification should be extended and strengthened.
 (2) The Environmental Protection Agency claims that it has 
 authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide as 
 a  ⁇ pollutant'', although the Administrator of the 
 Environmental Protection Agency has not yet proposed to 
 regulate carbon dioxide under the Act.
 (3) When the Congress enacted and amended the Clean Air 
 Act, it did not delegate to the Environmental Protection Agency 
 authority to regulate carbon dioxide. Such regulation would 
 constitute a usurpation of legislative power.
 (4) Furthermore, regulation of carbon dioxide would 
 necessarily have the effect of implementing the Kyoto Protocol.
 (5) Since a speech by the President on October 22, 1997, 
 the Administration has called for enactment of a program 
 commonly known as  ⁇ credit for early action'' or  ⁇ early action 
 crediting'' as part of its global climate change policy.
 (6) Early action crediting is fundamentally a strategy to 
 prematurely implement the nonratified Kyoto Protocol and to 
 build a pro-Kyoto business constituency.
 (7) Early action crediting would reward some big businesses 
 for taking steps to comply with the Kyoto Protocol prior to its 
 ratification.
 (8) Early action crediting would also encourage 
 participating big businesses to support ratification, because 
 participants would acquire costly paper assets that could be 
 used as emission credits under a future regulatory system and 
 that could be monetized if the Kyoto Protocol were ratified.
 (9) Early action crediting is not a truly voluntary 
 program, because it would penalize non-participants by reducing 
 the supply of emission credits available to them in the first 
 Kyoto Protocol compliance period.
 (10) Early action crediting would increase compliance costs 
 under the Kyoto Protocol for small businesses and family farms, 
 which generally lack the technical expertise and discretionary 
 capital required for participation in emissions reduction 
 projects and lack the legal sophistication necessary to 
 negotiate early action agreements with Federal agencies.
 (11) Early action crediting would lose even the pretense of 
 being voluntary if it were administered by the Environmental 
 Protection Agency or any other agency wielding powers of 
 regulatory coercion.
 (12) Companies already may voluntarily record and report 
 their actions to reduce greenhouse gases under section 1605 of 
 the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13385). That section 
 is administered by the Energy Information Administration, an 
 agency with no regulatory authority or agenda.
 (13) Early action crediting is not needed to protect early 
 big business emissions reducers from any extra costs under the 
 Kyoto Protocol, because, as a practical political matter, the 
 Kyoto Protocol will not be ratified and implementing 
 legislation will not be adopted without the active support of 
 the policy makers and big businesses advocating early action 
 crediting.
 (14) The most effective way for members of the Congress to 
 protect United States competitiveness, small businesses, and 
 family farms from the regulatory excesses of a possible future 
 climate treaty is to declare their unequivocal and unqualified 
 opposition to the Kyoto Protocol.
 (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:
 (1) To safeguard the Senate's constitutional role in treaty 
 making.
 (2) To prevent implementation of the Kyoto Protocol prior 
 to its ratification.
 (3) To protect small businesses and family farms from 
 incurring additional costs under a future climate change treaty 
 or domestic program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON FEDERAL ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE KYOTO PROTOCOL.

 (a) In General.--Federal funds may not be used to propose or issue 
rules, regulations, decrees, or orders or used to propose or issue 
rules, regulations, decrees, or orders or for programs designed to 
implement, or in preparation for implementing, the Kyoto Protocol to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change before the 
date on which the Senate gives its advice and consent to ratification 
of the Kyoto Protocol.
 (b) No Federal Authority To Regulate Carbon Dioxide Emissions.--
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal Agency has 
authority to promulgate regulations to limit emissions of carbon 
dioxide unless a law is enacted after the date of enactment of
