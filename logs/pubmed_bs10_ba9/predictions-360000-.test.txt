hypertension and its sequelae , heart failure , are a disastrous duo , and they should be recognized , and a tailored focus on management in special populations , high - risk ethnic minority groups especially blacks who are disproportionately burdened should be developed . 
 the overall u.s . 
 prevalence of hypertension among adults ages 18 years in 20052008 was 30.9% and was highest among persons ages 65 years ( 69.7% ) and non - hispanic blacks ( 44% ) . 
 the relative incidence of heart failure is 50% higher in african americans , 3% of whom have heart failure , compared with 2% of the general population . 
 heart failure in comparison to the most prevalent gender malignancies ( bowel cancer in men and breast cancer in women ) , was associated with worse long - term survival . 
 the disastrous duo , hypertension and heart failure , should be recognized , and a tailored focus on management in special populations , high - risk ethnic minority groups especially blacks who are disproportionately burdened should be developed .

several chemoprotective properties of lycopene on prostate cancer have been proposed , including potent antioxidant properties , decreased lipid oxidation , inhibition of cancerous cell proliferation at the g0-g1 cell cycle transition , and protection of lipoproteins and dna . 
 these mechanistic studies have stimulated the examination of lycopene and its primary source , tomato products , on risk of prostate cancer . 
 however , studies on lycopene and tomato product intake and prostate cancer incidence have yielded mixed results . 
 the study of this relationship has been complicated by unique and challenging epidemiologic considerations in the measurement of lycopene and on the influence of prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) screening on prostate cancer incidence and progression . as with all epidemiologic studies , 
 this paper briefly describes the methodology essential for conducting studies on the association between lycopene and prostate cancer incidence and provides an updated review of studies of lycopene and tomato products with prostate cancer risk .

background : the goal of clinical blood transfusion is to provide qualitative , safe , and adequate blood to recipient . 
 the main sources of blood procurement are commercial ( remunerated ) blood donors , voluntary donors , and replacement donors . 
 blood transfusion is a known risk factor for transmission of infectious diseases including viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) , and hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) . 
 the risk of transmission is highest with blood procured from commercial donors . 
 several nations have made frantic efforts and are making significant improvement towards achieving 100% voluntary donor blood procurement but not so much has been achieved in nigeria . 
 only 5% of voluntary donation has been achieved in some major donor centers in nigeria .

the torque web server implements a novel method for querying protein networks that does not require information on the interconnections ( topology ) among the query proteins . 
 this makes torque applicable in broader scenarios , such as querying complexes or pathways whose topologies are not completely known , or even when querying from species for which topology information is not available . 
 it combines three approaches : a dynamic programming method utilizing color coding , integer linear programming and a fast heuristic based on shortest paths . 
 torque automatically selects the best method to apply at each stage and outputs the highest scoring match . 
 scores are based on the underlying network structure , on interaction confidence values and on sequence similarities between matching proteins .

abstractsmall cell carcinoma of the bladder is a very rare and aggressive histological subtype , and accounts for less than 1% of all bladder tumors . 
 its management is challenging because it presents in the same way of other more frequent histological types , but with a high metastatic power . 
 the diagnosis demands that the pathologist be suspicious and accurate in the analysis of the fragments of a transurethral bladder resection ( tur ) . 
 multimodal treatment , including radical cystectomy , chemotherapy and radiation therapy should be initiated as soon as possible for a chance of cure and to improve survival . 
 this kind of carcinoma presents metastasis and has a poor prognosis . in the present article 
 we report a case of a male patient with small cell carcinoma of the bladder and the development of the condition , and we aim to show the most current management of this tumor , which has no consensus for treatment in the international literature for being extremely rare .

the purpose of this study was to define associated pathologies and determine if professional athletes could return to high - level athletics following arthroscopic decompression of femoroacetabular impingement ( fai ) . 
 a retrospective chart review was performed of all professional athletes presenting for arthroscopic treatment of fai by the senior author between october 2000 and september 2005 . 
 all athletes presented with debilitating hip pain and an inability to participate in their sport . 
 physical examination criteria included a positive impingement test or flexion abduction external rotation ( faber ) test . 
 radiographic criteria included decreased anterior and superior femoral head neck offset , acetabular retroversion ( as defined by a positive cross - over sign ) , or coxa profunda ( as defined by the medial acetabular border overlapping the ilioischial line ) . for athletes with documented physical and radiographic evidence of fai , conservative treatment was limited to only 6 weeks . based on evidence described by beck and colleagues , 
 our thought was that conservative treatment could not address the underlying bony abnormalities and any further treatment delay in these highly active patients would likely precipitate further irreversible damage to the articular cartilage .

macrolides , lincosamides , and streptogramins ( mls ) , though chemically distinct , are usually considered together because most share overlapping binding sites on the 50s subunit of the ribosome and many bacteria carry acquired resistance genes which confer resistance to more than one drug within this group . 
 these antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis by binding within the exit tunnel , adjacent to the peptidyl transferase center , and inhibit translation by preventing progression of the nascent chain inducing peptidyl - trna drop off . 
 different antibiotics within the mls group interact and bind with different rrna residues which may account for why a bacterium may be resistant to the macrolide erythromycin but susceptible to semi - synthetic erythromycin telithromycin . 
 macrolides , lincosamides , and streptogramin b antibiotics , though chemically distinct , are usually considered together because most share overlapping binding sites on the 50s subunit of the ribosome and many bacteria carry acquired resistance genes which confer resistance to more than one drug within this group .

abstractwe experienced a case of pseudozyma aphidis fungaemia with invasive fungal pneumonia after reinduction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia ( aml ) . 
 a 51yearold man who was diagnosed with aml started reinduction chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin . on day seven after reinduction chemotherapy , 
 neutropenic fever developed . 
 although the patient had no respiratory symptoms , infiltration was suspected in the right lower lung field on the chest radiograph on d9 . 
 lowdose computed tomography of the lung was performed , which showed consolidation with surrounding ground glass opacity at the medial segment of the right middle lobe ( rml ) . 
 the patient received fluconazole instead of posaconazole as the primary antifungal prophylaxis ; because he had participated in a clinical trial using a thrombopoietin receptor agonist during the same period , a drug interaction was possible . 
 then , the antifungal prophylaxis was empirically changed to caspofungin for the possibility of fungal pneumonia according to the revised definition of invasive fungal infections from the european organization for the research and treatment of cancer / mycoses study group ( eortc / msg ) .

isomerization 
 of aspartic acid to isoaspartic acid 
 ( d - isoasp ) or isoaspartic acid to isoaspartic acid ( d - isoasp ) is a common 
 post - translational modification ( ptm ) found in aging proteins . 
 
 however , isomerization of aspartic acid to isoaspartic acid has 
 not been extensively studied . 
 we have determined the crystal structures 
 of aspartic acid to isoaspartic acid ( l - isoasp ) , isoaspartic 
 acid to isoaspartic acid ( d - isoasp ) , and isoaspartic acid to isoaspartic 
 acid ( d - isoasp ) complexes from asp92 , a mouse lens protein . 
 the 
 crystal structures reveal that aspartic acid undergoes isomerization 
 to d - isoasp and d - isoasp . 
 isomerization of aspartic 
 acid to isoaspartic acid also leads to mass shifts .

the ubiquitously expressed protein phosphatase 2a ( pp2a ) has been proposed as a target for the treatment of a number of pathologies ranging from neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer disease to a variety of neoplasias . 
 compared to other members of the phosphoprotein phosphatase ( ppp ) superfamily of serine / threonine phosphatases , a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which pp2a recognizes substrates and mediates site - specific dephosphorylation remains to be developed . 
 sequence and structural homology of the catalytic subunits of ppp family members has revealed a conserved catalytic mechanism in which a divalent metal cation activates a water molecule to hydrolyze phospho - serine / threonine without the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate . at present , consensus sequences in pp2a substrates have not been identified . 
 this review will focus on our emerging understanding of pp2a substrate specificity , which appears to involve additive effects of multiple discrete interactions .

extramedullary pulmonary hematopoiesis is a rare cause of pulmonary hypertension . 
 the usual sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis are the liver , spleen and intrathoracic paraspinal regions . 
 lungs and pleura are rare sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis with less than forty cases of pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis described in the current literature . 
 a causal association between pulmonary hematopoiesis leading to dyspnea and pulmonary hypertension has been postulated in few case reports and a limited number of cohort studies . 
 we report the case of a 66-year - old man in whom pulmonary hypertension and severe tricuspid regurgitation was diagnosed on technetium-99 m ( tc-99 m ) sulfur colloid bone marrow scan and single - photon emission computed tomography ( spect)/ct .

etoposide - induced double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) during mitosis activate pikks to induce phosphorylation of h2ax , and mdc1 as well as the mrn complex are recruited to the dsb sites . during mitosis 
 , dsbs activate pikks to induce phosphorylation of h2ax , and mdc1 as well as the mrn complex are recruited to the dsb sites . 
 however , the recruitment of rnf8 , rnf168 , 53bp1 , and brca1 to dsb is largely suppressed . 
 two groups recently showed that localization of rnf8 and 53bp1 to dsbs is inhibited during mitosis . 
 orthwein et al . 
 also identified t198 on rnf8 as a cdk1 phosphorylation site and found that 53bp1-t1609a / s1618a double mutant protein can localize to mitotic chromatin and restores dsb repair in cells expressing rnf8-t198a . 
 their study confirmed that there are at least two distinct mechanisms to regulate the recruitment of these ddr effector proteins .

oral malignant melanoma is an extremely rare tumor arising from uncontrolled growth of melanocytes found in the basal layer of oral mucous membrane . 
 it occurs between 30 and 90 years of age , with a higher incidence in the 6th decade with a mean age of 56 years . 
 it is having a higher prevalence in yellows , blacks , japanese , and indians of asia due to more frequent finding of melanin pigmentation in oral mucosa of these races . 
 a total of 80% to 90% of oral malignant melanoma arises in the mucosa of maxillary jaw with a majority occurring on the keratinized mucosa of hard palate and gingiva . 
 clinically , it is easy to diagnose them as these are pigmented ones and have irregular shape and outline . 
 these are mostly asymptomatic and detected only when there is ulceration or hemorrhage of the overlying epithelium . 
 the delayed detection may be the cause for the poor prognosis with a 5-year survival being between 15% and 38% . 
 the purpose of this article is to present a case of oral malignant melanoma , as well as to emphasize the necessity for early recognition and treatment of this lesion .

age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) is a prevalent cause of blindness among elderly persons . 
 glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( gdnf ) has been associated with significant effects with respect to preventing cell death , including the protection of specific neuronal populations in the brain , spinal cord , and retina . 
 previously , we showed that it is possible to derive neural progenitor cells ( npcs ) from the developing cat brain and that these cells are capable of integration into the retina of dystrophic feline recipients . 
 to more fully exploit the potential of this model , it is useful to develop feline npcs capable of sustained growth factor delivery to the host retina . 
 here we use a bicistronic feline lentiviral vector to generate genetically modified feline neural progenitor cells that exhibit sustained overexpression of gdnf before and after differentiation . 
 our results show that npcs derived from dystrophic feline recipients can survive for prolonged periods , migrate extensively , secrete growth factors , and rescue visual function following subretinal transplantation .

biliary hamartoma is a benign congenital malformation of the biliary duct which was described for the first time in 1918 by von mayenburg , therefore it is also called von mayenburg complex ( vmcs ) . 
 although jaundice and portal hypertension may arise as a result of mass effect , patients are usually asymptomatic . 
 the biliary hamartomas may be single or multiple , with size ranging between 1 and 15 mm . 
 biliary hamartomas usually presents as multiple small nodules and despite the fact that they are rare , they may be confused with liver metastatic disease , microabscesses , diffuse primary hepatocellular carcinoma , biliary cysts or caroli s disease . in conclusion , associating different imaging modalities with the follow - up are very useful in the diagnosis of biliary hamartoma .

objectivesthe korean government introduced a new social insurance scheme for long - term care ( ltc ) in july 2008 . 
 the ltc insurance program provides social services for elderly people with a few functional limitations . 
 the purpose of this insurance system was to meet the markedly increased demand for elderly healthcare as a result of a rapidly aging population , elevated expectations for healthcare , and a change in the pattern of medical conditions in the elderly from acute illness to chronic disability . 
 this insurance uses the ltc grade for denoting how much help is required for an elderly person in their daily lives . 
 after the implementation of ltc insurance , the number of nursing facilities in korea also increased sharply from 1717 locations ( 68,581 people ) in 2008 to 3751 locations ( 116,782 people).methodsa retrospective cross - sectional survey study was performed in patients aged 65 years or older , which produced a sample of 824 people admitted to 20 nursing facilities in northwest korea from january 2012 to february 2012 .

extrahepatic portal venous obstruction ( ehpvo ) is the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in children and is also a common cause of variceal bleeding in adults . 
 ehpvo has been attributed to umbilical sepsis after birth with thrombosis extending to the portal system via the patent umbilical vein or portal pyaemia following intra - abdominal sepsis . 
 the characteristic findings are the replacement of portal vein by multiple tortuous vessels , also known as cavernous transformation , with hepatopetal blood flow in the collaterals . 
 investigations to confirm the diagnosis are usually simple and readily available at most centres . 
 patients with ehpvo have normal liver function ( and histology ) which helps them to sustain bleeding episodes without decompensation . 
 however , mortality rates of between 5 and 30% have been reported for a single bleeding episode because of the large volumes of blood lost in patients who do not have access to sophisticated medical facilities including blood transfusion . with the advent of endoscopic therapy , this soon became the predominant treatment modality for the control of acute bleeding and also an important method for the prevention of a repeated bleeding episode . 
 the main disadvantages of endotherapy are that it requires multiple sessions and

background : medical researchers observe deficiencies in health care occurring due to many prescribing errors . 
 although prescription writing is a part of the medical students ' curriculum , their prescribing skills are still poor either as a part of their examinations or as they go out as qualified health professionals . 
 patient - based teaching is one of the educational interventions to teach clinical skills using real patients . 
 this intervention offers lifelike preparation and has more relevance to the trainee s future , i.e. , their day - to - day performance as a doctor.aims and objectives : this study was conducted to determine the role of educational intervention ( patient - based teaching ) to improve the prescribing skill of ii year medical students.materials and methods : two groups of 25 students were selected randomly from ii mbbs to participate in this study . 
 the control group included all the 25 students who were posted to surgery postings and the test group included whole of the 25 students who were posted in general medicine department . 
 the participants of the test group were subjected to patient - based teaching which was carried out in the general medicine department of our hospital exposing the students of test group to real patients suffering from the above mentioned clinical conditions .

we investigated the prevalence of heterogenous vancomycin intermediate staphylococcus aureus ( hvisa ) among methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) strains isolated at hospital kuala lumpur ( hkl ) in a 3-month period and determined factors associated with its infections . 
 a total of 320 index mrsa isolates ( first mrsa isolated from the corresponding patients ) were collected and established as strains for vancomycin resistance testing . 
 strains were first screened for the phenotype using glycopeptide resistance detection ( grd ) etest antibiotic strips . 
 after grd screening , a total of 8 strains were defined as presumptive hvisa , no visa strain was detected . 
 area under the curve ( auc ) analyses of the strains ' population analysis profiles confirmed that 7 out of the 8 tested strains were hvisa , giving a prevalence rate of 2.19% . 
 multivariate linear regression analysis showed that diabetes mellitus , male sex , male renal failure , acute encephalitis with haptracheal aspirate and hospital acquired pneumonia were independent factors associated with hvisa .

dipeptidyl peptidase ( dpp)-4 inhibitors are a new class of anti - diabetic agents that improve glucose homeostasis by enhancing the actions of incretin hormones . 
 vildagliptin has a relatively shorter half - life than other dpp-4 inhibitors and therefore is preferably administered twice daily . 
 exposure to vildagliptin in patients with moderate - to - severe renal impairment is increased compared with that observed in control subjects . 
 in contrast , the level of the primary metabolite of ( dpp)-4 ( m20.7 ) increases in association with declines of renal function ; however , increases in the level of this metabolite have no clinically relevant consequences . 
 therefore , vildagliptin can be used without dose adjustment in patients with a creatinine clearance of > 50 ml / min . in this article 
 , we report the first case , to our knowledge , of sarcoid - like lung granulomas in a hemodialysis patient treated with vildagliptin .

dietary sugar intake , in the form of sucrose or high - fructose corn syrup ( hfcs ) , has dramatically increased and correlates with a rise in obesity , metabolic syndrome , and diabetes . 
 the hedonic value of highly palatable foods and their wide availability can override the physiological mechanisms related to energy homeostasis . 
 both drugs and food have powerful reinforcing effects partly mediated by dopamine increases in the limbic system that , under certain circumstances or in vulnerable individuals , could overwhelm the brain s homeostatic control mechanisms , but the plausibility of sugar addiction and its role in obesity and eating disorders in humans is still a subject of controversy .

protein domains are often conserved across many species and , as such , offer an interesting dataset for analyzing how genomes maintain any given domain in relation to other conserved domains , as well as for analyzing the relationship of conserved domain occurrence to proteome size . 
 many groups have attempted to find , document and annotate these conserved domains . whereas most groups use a form of hidden markov models for profiling , each group approaches the problem in a unique way , yielding a wide range of databases that can be used to verify each other . for this study 
 i used the smart cd database to collect data on the number of genes containing each conserved domain in each genome . 
 the study was restricted to the five eukaryote genomes sequenced so far : homo sapiens , drosophila melanogaster , arabidopsis thaliana , caenorhabditis elegans and saccharomyces cerevisiae . 
 results were confirmed using a repository of databases called the proteome analysis database . 
 a close link is revealed between numbers of genes with a given conserved domain and the total number of genes in each genome .

the three compounds lincomycin , clindamycin , and pirlimycin comprise a group of clinically important antibiotics known as lincosamides . 
 lincosamides block bacterial protein synthesis , which takes place on the ribosomes . 
 however , extensive use of these antibiotics has led to increased resistance in many strains of bacteria , which have been developing various mechanisms to counter these drugs . 
 one known mechanism is structural modification of the drug s target ( ribosome ) through the methylation of 23s rna ( e.g. , base no . 
 2058 ) and/or mutations ( e.g. , of bases g2057 , a2058 , c2452 , and c2611 ) . 
 other mechanisms of resistance are active efflux of the drug across the cell surface , or its enzymatic deactivation . 
 bacterial resistance together with side effects are the most important reasons for improving known lincosamides and designing modified compounds . 
 the conformational properties of free clindamycin and lincomycin have been studied using x - ray techniques as well as 1h and 13c nm

multicystic dysplastic kidney ( mcdk ) , a variant of renal dysplasia , is one of the most frequently identified congenital urinary tract abnormalities ( cakut ) . 
cowden disease ( cd ) is an autosomal - dominant condition with variable expression that results most commonly ( 80% ) from a mutation in the pten gene on chromosome 10q . 
 although mcdk can be an isolated finding , it is often associated with other cakut . 
 additionally , this condition has also been described in association with other multisystemic disorders of known genetic etiologies . 
 most mcdks undergo involution within the first years of life ; nevertheless , a continuous follow - up should be performed not only to identify other urologic abnormalities , but also because hypertension and abnormal renal function have been reported .

due to the pivotal role played by endothelial cells in tumour angiogenesis , most previous efforts were devoted to the development of agents that could block their activation by an angiogenic signal ( mainly vegf ) , or to inhibit one or several specific functions of activated endothelial cells ( proliferation , adhesion to extracellular matrix , proteolytic activities , migration , invasion or differentiation ) . in spite of the great number of angiogenesis inhibitors described so far , and the interesting results obtained in experimental models , even showing complete tumour regressions in pre - clinical studies , modest or even negative results emerged from the first generation of compounds entered in clinical trials . 
 nevertheless , there is no reason for premature pessimism , as revealed by current ongoing trials and the clinical developmental status of anti - angiogenic drugs . 
 a critical analysis of the disappointing results obtained in previous clinical trials points to different reasons for this failure . 
 these include flaws in the methods used to select these inhibitors and in the design of the clinical trials to test their effects , as well as an oversimplified view of tumour vasculature pathophysiology .

periodontitis ( pd ) is a chronic inflammatory disease where resident cells and preformed mediators induce leukocyte infiltration and progressive destruction of the tooth supporting tissues as a result of interaction between bacterial products , cell populations , and mediators in disease - susceptible individuals . 
 this is also influenced by genetic and environmental risk factors and is characterized as a complex disease with multifactorial etiology . in this context , environmental factors , including oral hygiene / bacterial plaque , smoking , and stress , play an important role in the expression of pd . 
 furthermore , it has been evidenced by some authors that there is a joint influence of polymorphisms in multiple genes , such as the genes of il-10 and il-6 . 
 polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( pmns ) represent the first line of defense against periodontitis , but bacterial evasion of the neutrophil microbicidal machinery coupled with delayed neutrophil apoptosis may transform the neutrophil from defender to perpetrator . 
 the susceptibility of ra may be associated with genetic or environmental factors . 
 some studies have suggested that the susceptibility of ra may be associated with genetic or environmental factors .

prostate cancer ( pca ) is the second most common neoplasia in men worldwide , and the sixth cause of cancer - specific death worldwide . in asian countries , 
 the incidence and mortality of pca are low and are reported to be about 1/8 of that in western countries . 
 however , some epidemiological investigations suggest the incidence of pca in asian men who migrant to the usa rapidly approaches that in western men within two generations . 
 interestingly , asian - american men retaining at least one genetic or lifestyle characteristic of asian residents make their risk of pca less than that of white residents of the usa . 
 by contrast , western diets mainly comprise red meat - based foods with bare isoflavones . 
 isoflavone is one of the phytoestrogens with similar molecular structures to animal estrogen and has weak estrogenic effects . 
 the major isoflavones include genistin , daidzin , glycitin , equol , and biochanin a and , in particular , genistein is the most widely investigated isoflavon .

medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric brain tumor , with an incidence of  ⁇ 0.5/100,000 children  ⁇  15 years old . 
 current treatment consisting of surgery , radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy has a limited role in improving the prognosis of patients . 
 an increasing number of studies have revealed that micrornas ( mirnas / mirs ) serve a role in tumorigenesis . 
 mirnas are involved in the regulation of the majority of physiological and pathological process , including development , life span , and metabolism , and their dysregulation contributes to a number of types of disease , notably cancer . 
 ingenuity pathway analysis ( ipa ) was used to analyze the regulatory network of the differentially expressed mirna in medulloblastoma . 
 it was proposed that the pathways exhibited in the network may have an important role in the tumorigenesis of medulloblastoma .

backgrounda rapid development of medical sciences in all fields of laboratory diagnostics entails a need to improve the analytical process , which now must meet increasingly strict requirements of scientific societies that set forth new standards in diagnostics and treatment . 
 the most recent guidelines recommended by esc , acc , aha , and whf concerning biomarkers of myocardial necrosis also apply to the work of clinical laboratories . 
 both good analytical quality and the time of the analysis allow for obtaining a reliable result of the analysis as quickly as possible , which makes it possible for a physician to promptly perform a medical intervention . 
 the aim of this study was to determine and compare the analytical quality of the tests in the standard and stat versions for determining serum level : cardiac isoform of troponin t with high sensitivity method ( tnths ) , mbmass isoenzyme of creatine kinase ( ckmbmass ) , and myoglobin , as well as to verify whether the tnths stat test meets requirements for use in patients with acute coronary syndrome ( acs).material / methodsthe study was performed with the use of roche assay kits made by roche the precicontrol cardiac ii and precicontrol troponin .

the association of pancreatic disease with fat necrosis at distant foci was first described by chiari in 1883 . 
 the most common pancreatic disorders associated with pancreatic panniculitis are acute or chronic pancreatitis , especially the alcohol - related types , and pancreatic carcinoma . 
 other pancreatic disorders have been infrequently reported to be associated with pancreatic panniculitis , and these include post - traumatic pancreatitis , pancreatic pseudocyst , pancreas divisum , and hemophagocytic syndrome . to the best of our knowledge , 
 one case was associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma , and the other two were associated with acute and chronic pancreatitis , respectively . 
 we report here on a case of pancreatic panniculitis associated with acute pancreatitis that had a fatal outcome . 
 physicians should be aware of this disease entity because this rare cutaneous manifestation may be associated with major morbidity and significant mortality .

point - of - care testing ( poct ) is an increasingly popular means of delivering laboratory tests close to the patient . 
 poct allows for rapid diagnostics and turnaround of test results to provide for faster medical decision - making and improved patient outcomes . 
 however , if inappropriate samples are collected , specimen is mislabeled , analysis is performed incorrectly , or test is misinterpreted , wrong results may be reported and acted on by the clinician . 
 laboratory directors should know our processes and take steps to detect and prevent errors before those mistakes reach the clinician and affect patient care . 
 risk management is a way to reduce errors with poct . 
 risk is the chance of suffering harm or loss , and risk can also apply to the operator of the poct device , the laboratory administration and even the hospital and its reputation . 
 errors that occur more frequently have greater risk , and errors that lead to greater harm also present greater risk . 
 when errors are detected , the harm to patients is estimated and actions are taken to prevent recurrence in the future . 
 so , risk management is simply a formal term for many of the activities that laboratories are already doing .

backgroundthe aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of low back pain ( lbp ) among students practicing sports , and to compare the prevalence of lbp between males and females.methodsthis is a retrospective cross - sectional survey involving students at the higher institute of sport and physical education in the city of sfax . 
 data on age , weight , height , and smoking habits are collected routinely when students join the institute , and then the sport in which the student is injured in the low back is registered in the institute health service files . 
 lbp was defined as pain or discomfort in the low - back region , from the lower rib curvature to the lower part of the seat region . 
 the question used systematically by the doctor of the institute health service to identify and estimate lbp cases was about the present injury and if and when they had lbp in the past . 
 furthermore , every registered injury causing lbp was recorded with its severity , but the most important detail for us was the sport in which the student was injured . 
 students who were injured more than one time were taken into account as subjects with lbp only for their first injury.resultsa total of

deep 
 geological disposal facilities ( gdf ) proposed by 
 us and european waste management organisations employ an engineered 
 multibarrier approach to retard the release of radioactive species 
 from the waste in quantities that could be detrimental to life and the 
 environment . 
 a significant obstacle to implementation of gdf is public and political 
 concern around risks and consequences of failure against design criteria 
 over the 10 to 10 year required lifespan of the facility , highlighted 
 by several failures to site gdf repositories , e.g. , in the uk and at yucca mountain 
 in the usa . 
 an improved understanding of the behavior of pertechnetate 
 in proposed barrier materials is also necessary to evaluate the potential 
 of different design specifications to mitigate or remove the potential hazard . 
 
 quantitative imaging techniques offer a means of achieving this information 
 and have been developed to study reactive transport in porous media 
 for a range of materials . 
 understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics 
 of geochemistry within and surrounding a gdf is essential in this task .

the normal maternal immune response to pregnancy is a dynamic process , with changes in the maternal pro / anti - inflammatory profile occurring at different stages of gestation . 
 such analyses are critical for understanding the response to specific infectious and immunologic diseases that show disproportionately negative outcomes during pregnancy , such as influenza and ulcerative colitis . 
 one approach to such immune profiling is through the use of multiplex cytokine arrays , allowing for simultaneous quantification of many proteins with a very small amount of plasma or serum . 
 the results of some longitudinal studies have been published in recent years , although results have been based on relatively few time points ( 5 or fewer ) . in this study 
 , we applied the multiplex array approach to evaluate the changes in 42 cytokines in rich detail during pregnancy . 
 the samples are from a cohort of 16 pregnant women , with each subject sampled a median of 18 times . 
 we also describe a strategy addressing within - subject correlation with repeated measurements using unconditional growth modeling . with this approach 
 , we have been able to detail the typical longitudinal variation of serum cytokines throughout pregnancy in this cohort of women .

the damage to lipid membranes , otherwise known as lipid peroxidation is defined as the oxidative deterioration of polyunsaturated fats in cellular lipid membranes caused by oxygen free radicals . 
 the area of antioxidant supplementation and its ameliorating effects on exercise induced free radical damage ( including lipid peroxidation ) has attracted considerable interest in recent years . 
 the primary objectives of the investigation were to determine : ( 1 ) whether a high intensity , whole body resistance exercise test ( ret ) caused lipid peroxidation measures to significantly increase , ( 2 ) the effects of a 2 week period of antioxidant vitamin supplementation ( vitamin e ) on the levels of lipid peroxidation measures caused by the ret , and ( 3 ) the impact that the training state ( untrained vs trained ) had on possible lipid peroxidation measures caused by the ret . 
 secondary purposes were to confirm whether a 2 week treatment period with vitamin e supplementation significantly increased blood plasma vitamin e levels and whether a 4 week washout period returned blood plasma vitamin e levels to baseline measures . 
 the results showed that trained participants have increased protection against oxygen free radicals .

abstractasthma has been described as an acephalic migraine and pulmonary migraine , and several epidemiologic studies have reported an association between migraine and respiratory disorders . 
 however , no study has investigated the temporal frequency of migraine development in patients with asthma , and the results of previous studies may be difficult to generalize . 
 therefore , we conducted this retrospective nationwide cohort study by using data retrieved from taiwan 's national health insurance research database ( nhird ) to test the hypothesis that patients with asthma have a higher risk of migraine.we conducted a nationwide retrospective population - based cohort study involving 2 groups : an asthma group and a nonasthma group . 
 for each patient with asthma , 4 insured persons without a diagnosis of asthma were selected from the longitudinal health insurance database 2000 as the nonasthma group and were frequency - matched according to sex , age , and index year by using the same inclusion criteria as those of the asthma cohort.we identified 41,011 patients newly diagnosed with asthma ( icd-9-cm 493 ) between january 1 , 2000 and december 31 , 2005 . 
 we excluded patients younger than 12 years ( n = 13,813

osteopetrosis is a rare inherited bone disease characterized by increased bone mass . 
 osteoopetrosis is an osteocondensing disease . in principle 
 , two causes could give rise to this osteocondensing phenotype : increased bone formation or failure of resorption by osteoclasts . 
 however , osteopetrosis is known to result from defective osteoclast differentiation or function . 
 important progress has been made during the past decades in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of hereditary diseases characterized by increased bone mass . 
 our objective in this review is not to give a detailed description of all the sclerosing bone diseases ; such information can be found in other reviews . 
 instead , we discuss recent findings regarding osteopetrosis and how the study of this disease has contributed to new understanding of functions associated with the skeleton .

cerebral inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of secondary brain injury following traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) . 
 nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) , a key transcription factor that regulates the cellular antioxidant response , plays a broader role in modulating acute inflammatory response . in this study 
 , we evaluated the influence of nrf2 genotype on the cerebral upregulation of nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) activity , proinflammatory cytokine , and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( icam-1 ) after tbi . 
 we found that nrf2 ( + /+ ) mice exhibited reduced cerebral nf-b activation and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and icam-1 after tbi . 
 in contrast , nrf2 ( / ) mice exhibited reduced cerebral nf-b activation and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and icam-1 after tbi . 
 these results suggest that nrf2 plays an important role in limiting the cerebral inflammatory response after tbi .

abstractmany recent articles highlight the data revolution in healthcare , an offshoot of the vast amount of digital medical information that has now accumulated in electronic medical records , and present it as an opportunity to create a learning healthcare system . 
 the vision is for a population data - driven knowledge system that generalizes from every patient s life , disease and treatment experiences to impute the best course of action for diagnosis , prognosis and treatment of future patients . 
 we are experiencing a rapidly expanding collection of vast amounts of clinical data from routine practice and ambulatory monitoring . 
 clinicians must already make sense of a diverse variety of data input streams in order to make clinical decisions . 
 data have been notorious for their variable interoperability and quality , but a holistic use of the massive data sources available ( vital signs , clinical notes , laboratory results , treatments including medications and procedures ) can lead to new perspectives on challenging problems . 
 while the wetware of the human mind is a wonderful instrument for this purpose , we must design better data systems to support and improve those components of this data integration process that exceed human abilities .
