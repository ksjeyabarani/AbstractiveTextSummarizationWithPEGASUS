hypertension ( htn ) is the most common comorbidity in the world with significant public health implications [ 1 , 2 ] . the overall u.s .
prevalence of hypertension among adults ages 18 years in 20052008 was 30.9% and was highest among persons ages 65 years ( 69.7% ) and non - hispanic blacks ( 44% ) . 
the american heart association estimates that the incurred costs of hypertension are more than $ 93.5 billion per year , and that cardiovascular disease and stroke for which htn is the predominant risk factor , account for 17% of the total annual health expenditures in the united states .
hypertension and its sequelae , heart failure ( hf ) , are a progressive disease .
evidence shows that less than half of patients with heart failure survive five years ( after diagnosis ) , and less than a quarter of them live ten years after their initial diagnosis .
framingham heart study showed that hypertensive patients were more likely to develop heart failure ( 142 cases of hf detected during the first 16 years of followup ) than those who were normotensive .
the lifetime risk for development of hf among people with blood pressure ( bp ) > 160/90 mm hg is double that of those with bp  ⁇  140/90 mm hg . 
heart failure in comparison to the most prevalent gender malignancies ( bowel cancer in men and breast cancer in women ) , was associated with worse long - term survival .
over a million hospitalizations , contributing to more than 250,000 deaths , and escalating billions of dollars in health care expenditure is the norm .
the disastrous duo , htn and hf , should be recognized , and a tailored focus on management in special populations , high - risk ethnic minority groups especially blacks who are disproportionately burdened should be developed . among racial groups ,
african - american adults have the highest rates ( 44% ) of hypertension in the world and are more resistant to treatment . 
in particular , black women have the highest prevalence and the lowest blood pressure control . 
the relative incidence of hf is 50% higher in african americans , 3% of whom have hf , compared with 2% of the general population [ 13 , 14 ] . 
the disease occurs at an earlier age , and usually at a more advanced stage along with increased hospitalization and mortality .
other causes of hf include coronary artery disease , valvular heart disease , diabetes , left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomyopathies . 
overt clinical hf resulting from diastolic left ventricular dysfunction may be clinically indistinguishable from that resulting from systolic dysfunction
. hf with preserved left ventricular function is observed in 30% to 50% of adult cases of hf .
coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction is a principal cause of systolic left ventricular dysfunction followed by hypertension .
a variety of neurohormonal systems , especially the renin - angiotensin aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems are activated in response to the left ventricular dysfunction and such activation leads to abnormal ventricular remodeling . the inexorable progression to more severe stages of left ventricular dysfunction
can be significantly reduced by effective therapy with neurohormonal blockade including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( aceis ) , beta blockers ( bbs ) , and aldosterone antagonists .
current understanding of the pathophysiology of hf has revolved around neurohormonal activation [ 19 , 20 ] . 
this endothelial dysfunction may result from insufficient nitric oxide ( no ) secondary to either reduced endothelial production of no or to increase no inactivation [ 17 , 19 , 21 ] . in hf , a pronounced increase in angiotensin ii , with modestly reduced no is seen among whites . however , african americans with hf may exhibit greater no reduction ; conversely , angiotensin ii might be less elevated among whites .
important studies are investigating gene variation among the races that may influence the risk of developing hypertension and its complications , such as single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes encoding for 1-adrenergic receptors and a2c - adrenergic receptors .
african americans who are homozygous for polymorphisms in both the 1-adrenergic and a2c - adrenergic receptor genes are at a 10-fold greater risk for heart failure , which is overexpressed in african - americans . 
groups with overexpression of transforming growth factor -1 ( tgf-1 ) , a cytokine involved in cardiac fibrosis and remodeling , vascular and renal disease , production of the vasoconstrictor , endothelin-1 , and stimulation of renin release , have a worse prognosis .

several chemoprotective properties of lycopene on prostate cancer have been proposed , including potent antioxidant properties , decreased lipid oxidation , inhibition of cancerous cell proliferation at the g0-g1 cell cycle transition , and protection of lipoproteins and dna [ 1 , 2 ] .
these mechanistic studies have stimulated the examination of lycopene and its primary source , tomato products , on risk of prostate cancer .
however , studies on lycopene and tomato intake and prostate cancer incidence have yielded mixed results .
the study of this relationship has been complicated by unique and challenging epidemiologic considerations in the measurement of lycopene and on the influence of prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) screening on prostate cancer incidence and progression . as with all epidemiologic studies ,
this paper briefly describes the methodology essential for conducting studies on the association between lycopene and prostate cancer incidence and provides an updated review of studies of lycopene and tomato products with prostate cancer risk .
lycopene is a carotenoid devoid of vitamin a activity . the major source by far , particularly in western populations , is tomato and tomato products ; a few other foods such as watermelons and pink grapefruit also contain lycopene . in epidemiologic studies ,
approaches to assess an individual 's lycopene intake or status include studies that estimate intake of lycopene ( based on reported intake of foods and food content of lycopene from food composition databases ) , studies that assess tomato product intake as a surrogate of lycopene intake , and studies that measure lycopene levels in the serum or plasma .
an issue that is not unique for lycopene , but perhaps of special importance for this carotenoid , is the variable absorption of lycopene from different food sources . in particular , cooking in an oil medium substantially enhances bioavailability of lycopene in the intestine because lycopene is highly bound to plant source matrices and is highly lipophilic .
the measure of lycopene in the serum has theoretical advantages of accounting for absorption and not relying on study participants ' food recall and accuracy of food composition tables .
on the other hand , serum studies have frequently relied on a single measure , and how well a single measurement reflects long - term intake is not entirely clear . also , since lycopene comes largely from tomato sources , circulating lycopene level may be acting as a surrogate of tomato product intake , and other components of tomatoes may account for any observed association with cancer risk .
finally , a population that consumes overall low levels of lycopene or similar levels of lycopene across individuals may result in insufficient contrast between high and low consumers .
psa release into the serum occurs with tissue breakdown between the prostate gland lumen and capillaries .
the original purpose of the psa measurement was to monitor prostate cancer progression and recurrence .
the food and drug administration approved psa testing for monitoring disease status in men with prostate cancer in 1987 and expanded its use to diagnosing prostate cancer in 1992 .
this approval was followed by professional society guidelines that supported the use of psa testing for prostate cancer screening .
consequently , psa became widely used as a screening test in the united states and increasingly in other countries . as a screening modality ,
the sensitivity and specificity of psa varies based on the cut - off . for example , a psa level of 3 ng / ml has a sensitivity of 32% for detecting any prostate cancer and 68% for high - grade prostate cancer and a specificity of 85% .
if this level were increased to 4 ng / ml the sensitivity would decrease to 21% for any prostate cancer and 51% for high grade prostate cancer but specificity would improve to 91% .
elevated serum psa may precede invasive carcinoma by a minimum of 510 years . thus , psa testing enabled earlier detection of prostate cancer .
the rate of first - time psa testing was strongly correlated with prostate cancer incidence rates . with the onset of psa for screening , prostate cancer incidence increased and peaked in 1992 and declined thereafter .
prior to widespread psa use for screening , prostate cancer diagnosis was largely prompted by physical exam findings of an enlarged prostate or symptoms ranging from urinary incontinence to more advanced spinal cord compression and bony pain from metastasis ; therefore , prostate cancer was mostly detected in relatively advanced stages .
invasive carcinoma prevalence increases with age : 2% for men in their 30 s compared with 64% for men in their 70s .
one - third of men under age 80 will have prostate cancer detected on autopsy .
the lifetime risk of prostate cancer is 16% while the risk of mortality from prostate cancer is 2.9% . thus a 
psa screening era beginning in 1988 , fda approved in 1992 , and peaking between 1992 and 1998 has been referred to as a period in which prostate cancers diagnosed by serum psa alone encompassed a variety of stages of prostate cancers , including clinically indolent cancers [ 4 , 7 ] .

 hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection is reported to have a prevalence of approximately 3% worldwide .
majority of patients with chronic hcv have a mild , asymptomatic elevation in serum transaminase levels with no significant clinical symptoms . around 25% of patients with chronic hcv have persistently normal alanine aminotransferase ( pnalt ) .
definition of normal alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) has changed over time and reference range for normal alt differs based on different laboratory cutoffs .
prati et al . in 2002 suggested new cutoffs with 30 u / l ( international unit ) for men and 19 u / l for women compared to 40 
u / l and 30 u / l for men and women , respectively .
a 2009 american association for the study of liver disease ( aasld ) practice guideline suggested an alt value of 40 u / l on 2 - 3 different occasions separated by at least a month over a period of 6 months .
others have used 3 different alt levels equal to or below upper limit of normal ( uln ) separated by at least 1 month and sometimes over a period of 18 months .
it was generally thought that people with pnalt have a mild liver disease and the degree of liver fibrosis is minimal [ 614 ] . based on this ,
later on , it was realized that a considerable number of such patients developed significant inflammation and fibrosis over time .
more recently , treatment has been recommended along the same lines for patients with pnalt as patients with elevated alt .
although more data is becoming available about the relationship of liver enzymes and course of chronic hcv infection , data regarding hcv infection and pnalt is relatively scarce . because of variation in the definition of pnalt
, fewer studies have looked at the relationship of pnalt with chronic hcv infection using updated normal alt definitions .
department of hepatology at the university of illinois ( u of i ) medical center , chicago , had a database of over 1200 patients with chronic hcv infection .
medical records of these patients were reviewed in an effort to characterize patients with chronic hcv infection and pnalt .
histological and clinical parameters for patients with pnalt as well as elevated alt were analyzed .
database of patients with hcv infection presenting to u of i medical center , chicago , was reviewed .
patients with biopsy proven hcv infection and a detectable hcv ribonucleic acid ( rna ) in blood were chosen .
of these , patients with an alt at liver biopsy , at least one additional over the next 12 months , and liver biopsy slides available for review were identified .
most of the liver biopsy procedures were done at u of i medical center and in cases where biopsies were done at outside facility they were read again at u of i medical center .
two expert hepatologists , who were masked to clinical data , assigned knodell et al . 
intervals for alt measurement were chosen around the time of liver biopsy as well as 3 , 6 , and 12 months after biopsy .
patients with end - stage renal disease like those on dialysis and stage iv chronic kidney disease with creatinine clearance of 1529 , those who received organ transplant , those with co - infection with hiv , those who were positive for hepatitis b surface antigen ( hbsag ) , and those receiving antiviral therapy for chronic hcv were excluded .
pnalt was defined as alt 30 u / l on at least 2 different occasions over 12 months .
strict pnalt was defined as alt 30 u / l for males and 19 
u / l for females . demographic data including age at biopsy , gender , and race were recorded .
clinical data included body mass index ( bmi ) , alcohol use , tobacco use , and presence of diabetes mellitus ( dm ) .
hcv virus was further characterized by recording hcv rna levels , genotype , and duration of infection .
histological data included individual markers of inflammation like portal tract inflammation , piece meal necrosis , and lobular inflammation as well as fibrosis according to knodell et al . scoring system .
inflammatory score ( sum of portal tract inflammation , piece meal necrosis , and lobular inflammation ) and histologic activity index ( hai ) score ( sum of inflammatory score and fibrosis ) were calculated .
histologic data from pnalt was then compared with patients from elevated alt group . finally , clinical characteristics of pnalt with advanced fibrosis were compared with pnalt but with no advanced fibrosis .
independent sample t - test and chi - squared test were used to calculate p values where appropriate .

the demand for blood and blood products in nigeria is high due to road traffic accidents , surgical and obstetrical blood loss , and anemia from other causes . despite several
the goal of clinical blood transfusion is to provide qualitative , safe , and adequate blood to recipient.1 the challenges in achieving these goals are enormous and serious efforts are been made globally , by government , donor agencies , and voluntary organizations towards its actualization .
the main sources of blood procurement are commercial ( remunerated ) blood donors , voluntary donors , and replacement donors .
a commercial blood donor offers a unit of blood for a fee paid by a contracted hospital vendor .
a replacement blood donor is a family member or relative of a patient , donating a unit of blood to be used for a specific patient , while a voluntary blood donor is a well - meaning member of the society who donates his or her blood without any inducement for use by a recipient not known to him or her .
there is a general policy on blood screening before utilization in which a donor blood is screened for transfusion transmissible viral pathogens to ensure that only safe blood is transfused .
it is a well - established fact that the safest source of blood is from a voluntary donor.24 in 1997 , world health organization ( who ) set a goal of achieving 100% voluntary donation by 202056 but as at 2010 only 57 of 126 countries surveyed had established this as a standard.7 blood transfusion is a known risk factor for transmission of infectious diseases including viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) , and hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) .
the risk of transmission is highest with blood procured from commercial donors.2489 there is still a high dependence on remunerated donors especially in developing nations such as nigeria .
several nations have made frantic efforts and are making significant improvement towards achieving 100% voluntary donor blood procurement but not so much has been achieved in nigeria .
only 5% of voluntary donation has been achieved in some major donor centers in nigeria.7 the objective of this investigation is to evaluate donor blood procurement and the associated risk of transfusion transmissible viral infections in a tertiary health facility in south - south nigeria .
records of the blood transfusion unit of the health facility from 1 january 2009 to 31 december 2009 were reviewed in order to identify the methods of donor blood procurement and screening results for hiv , hbv and hcv .
for every unit of blood , we studied the method of procurement ( commercial , replacement or volunteer blood donation ) and screening outcome . in this study , voluntary and
replacement donors were grouped together due to the lack of proper differentiation in some of the records , the number of voluntary donors were very few and their blood were actually directed to specific recipients .
blood from commercial donors is usually obtained from outside of the hospital through several vendors .
collection by the vendor is usually not supervised by hospital personnel but adheres to routine guidelines for phlebotomy .
the vendor brings the units of blood to the hospital in fulfillment of a contractual agreement .
blood from replacement donor or panel donor is collected at the blood transfusion unit of the hospital .
blood ( 450 ml ) is usually collected into a bag containing 63 ml citrate phosphate dextrose with adenine ( cpda ) and stored at 2 - 8c .
prior to phlebotomy , the donor 's blood group is determined and the packed cell volume ( pcv ) ascertained .
units of blood from commercial donors are inspected to determine good anticoagulation and exclude hemolysis .
the strip has two horizontal lines labeled control and patient bars . at room temperature , and using automatic micropipette , 50 l of plasma or serum is added to the sample pad . the test strip is read within 15 - 60 min . a single red line at position c ( control ) on the strip indicates a valid control . a similar line is found in patient bar if positive for either hiv-1 or hiv-2 .
the sample is negative for hiv if there is no colour change in the patient bar .
hepatitis b surface antigen screening is carried out using the clinotech 's one - step hepatitis b antigen test strip .
an already anticoagulated blood sample is collected into a clean tube and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to obtain clear plasma at room temperature .
a test strip is then inserted into the test plasma to a maximum indicated by the manufacturers for 10 s and laid face up on a flat non - absorbent surface .
a test is positive if two transverse bands ( t = test and c = control ) are seen and negative when only the one band at control ( c ) is seen .
only units of donor blood found to have good collection and storage and free

in a network querying problem , one is given a small network , corresponding to a known pathway or a complex of interest . the goal is to identify similar instances in a large network , where similarity is measured in terms of sequence or interaction patterns .
previous approaches to the query problem required precise information on the interaction pattern of the query and were usually limited to small queries ( 24 proteins ) .
pathblast a server for querying linear pathways within a protein protein interaction ( ppi ) network ( 1)was subsequently extended to allow searching for more general structures ( 2 ) .
a general framework for subnetwork querying was developed ( 3 ) , but it is applicable only to very small queries due to its complexity .
two other methods are netmatch , a cytoscape ( 4 ) plugin implementing the work of ferro et al . ( 5 ) that utilizes fast heuristics for subgraph isomorphism to identify approximate matches of queries within a collection of networks , and netgrep ( 6 ) , a system for searching networks for patterns corresponding to small sets of proteins with specified attributes and topology .
the torque server implements a novel method for querying protein networks that does not require information on the interconnections ( topology ) among the query proteins ( 7 ) ( figure 1 ) .
this makes torque applicable in broader scenarios , such as querying complexes or pathways whose topologies are not completely known , or even when querying from species for which ppi information is not available .
( 8) also studied queries with no topology information , but since their method is enumerative it was applied to very small queries ( 24 proteins ) .
it was tested extensively on hundreds of queries of known complexes from a variety of species ( 7 ) .
it was shown to yield far more matches than the qnet topology - based approach ( 2 ) , while providing results that are highly functionally coherent . 

the network induced by the vertices labeled a , b , c , d and e is a match to the query , where vertex c is an insertion and query element 4 is deleted .
( a ) the query proteins ; ( b ) the queried network . colored vertices in the network match nodes of the same color in the query .
the network induced by the vertices labeled a , b , c , d and e is a match to the query , where vertex c is an insertion and query element 4 is deleted .
the torque web server implements the algorithms in ( 7 ) for querying protein sets across species .
it combines three approaches : a dynamic programming method utilizing color coding , integer linear programming and a fast heuristic based on shortest paths .
torque automatically selects the best method to apply at each stage and outputs the highest scoring match .
scores are based on the underlying network structure , on interaction confidence values and on sequence similarities between matching proteins .
the input for torque consists of : 
 a query set of proteins in species a;their protein sequences;a ppi network for species b;the sequences of the network proteins . 
 
a query set of proteins in species a ; their protein sequences ; a ppi network for species b ; the sequences of the network proteins .
all inputs are in simple text format : 
 the query set can be entered directly as a comma - delimited or whitespace - delimited list.protein sequences are given in the standard fasta format.the ppi network is given as a text file , where each row represents an interaction and contains the ids of the interacting pair and a confidence value for it in the range [ 0 , 1 ] . 
 
the query set can be entered directly as a comma - delimited or whitespace - delimited list .
the ppi network is given as a text file , where each row represents an interaction and contains the ids of the interacting pair and a confidence value for it in the range [ 0 , 1 ] .
it is possible to use a single fasta file ( input 2 ) for many queries , if it contains the sequences for all proteins in all queries .
when the query field is left blank , torque will use all the proteins in input 2 as the query .
if input 1 contains uniprot protein ids ( www.uniprot.org ) , their sequences need not be entered in input 2 ; instead , torque automatically retrieves them from the uniprot database . for several target species ,
currently , the server supports this option for the three target species saccharomyces cerevisiae , drosophila melanogaster and homo sapiens .
the user can indicate one of these target species instead of providing inputs 3

for the past 50 years disulfiram is the commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of alcohol dependence .
important side effects of disulfiram are hepatological , dermatological , neurological ( polyneuritis , encephalopathy)1,2 ) and psychiatric in nature .
psychiatric manifestations include confusion , loss of memory , psychosis,36 ) mania with psychotic symptoms.7,8 ) disulfiram s major metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate is an inhibitor of dopamine - betahydroxylase ( dbh ) , an enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of dopamine ( da ) to norepinephrine ( ne).9 ) by inhibiting this metabolic pathway from da to ne in the central nervous system , disulfiram results in an increase of da concentrations in mesolimbic system resulting in psychosis .
alcoholics who developed psychotic symptoms during disulfiram treatment are found to have low levels of amine and monoamine oxidase , suggesting dbh blockage.10 ) we present a case of 32-year - old male who developed psychosis with the use of disulfiram .
a 32-year - old male without past of psychiatric and neurological illness reported to psychiatry outpatient department with complaint of daily alcohol intake of 250750 ml ( 40% alcohol by volume ) for the last 5 years . with the informed consent of the patient
, disulfiram was administered at the dosage of 250 mg twice daily for 1 month , while the patient abstained from alcohol .
then the patient presented complaint of fearfulness , suspiciousness , easy irritability , muttering to self , decreased sleep for last one month .
haematological and biochemical indices were within normal limits . on mental status examination delusion of persecution and auditory
his fearfulness , suspiciousness , irritability , muttering to self and impaired sleep gradually improved over a period of 10 days .
risk factors for development of disulfiram related psychotic symptoms include past history or family history of psychosis , overly rapid increase in dosage or greater than recommended total dosage , old age , impaired liver function and concurrent dopaminergic medications or psycho - stimulant abuse.5,11 ) our patient has family history of schizophrenia in his father .
his psychotic symptoms improved after stoppage of disulfiram and use of lorazepam tablet only without any additional requirement of anti - psychotic treatment .
these factors support the association between with disulfiram use and emergence of psychotic symptoms in our patient .
the usual recommended initial dosage is 500 mg per day for the first 1 or 2 weeks , followed by a maintenance dosage of 250 mg per day.12 ) disulfiram related psychosis usually involve either therapeutic or higher than recommended dosages.13 ) our patient has developed psychotic symptoms with 500 mg per day of disulfiram .
we recommend that disulfiram should be used at the lowest effective dose , possibly 250 mg daily .
our case highlights the relevance of a careful history of patient s symptoms and family history that should be performed before starting treatment with disulfiram and caution should be taken while prescribing disulfiram for patients with personal and familial antecedents of psychosis .
disulfiram - related psychiatric complications are reported to be more prevalent in eastern countries,3 ) which suggests that genetic factors may play a role in disulfiram induced psychosis .

 insects - resistant population - samples from the el mal field 
 population of t. infestans were collected in november 2010 from 
 infested houses in the chaco province of argentina ( s2556.077 w6027.105 ) , where 
 vector control using pyrethroid insecticides is considered ineffective by the 
 authorities responsible for the chagas program of chaco province .
field - collected 
 insects were transported to the research center of pest and insecticides ( cipein ) 
 laboratory and further generations of these insects were bred in the laboratory .
the 50% 
 lethal dose ( ld50 ) obtained for deltamethrin for this population is 134 
 ng / insect , with a high resistance ratio of 1,031 ( carvajal et al .
a study performed at cipein has shown that eight years 
 after the most recent exposure to deltamethrin , the ld50 did not vary in a 
 population from northern argentina ( germano 
 2013 ) . 

susceptible population - for comparison , we used a susceptible 
 reference colony , nfs , derived from a domestic field population collected in december 
 2004 from santiago del estero , argentina .
this laboratory colony has been maintained without the 
 introduction of new insects from external sources .
a laboratory test with nfs has shown 
 an ld50 of 0.13 ( 0.11 - 0.15 ) ng / i for deltamethrin .
this value did not differ 
 statistically from that of the traditional laboratory - susceptible strain maintained at 
 cipein ( roca acevedo et al .
, each population was kept in enclosed boxes ( 30 x 30 x 30 cm ) at 28 1c 
 and 50 - 60% relative humidity with a photoperiod of 12:12 h ( l : d ) .
a pigeon was provided 
 weekly as a blood meal source ( who 1994 ) . 

chemicals - technical grade imidacloprid ( 98% ) provided by dr 
 ehrrenstorfer ( augsburg , germany ) was used in topical application bioassays . 

analytical grade acetone was purchased from jt baker ( san pedro xalostoc , 
 mexico ) . in the surface assays and spot - on bioassays ,
the following formulations of imidacloprid 
 were used : 35% emulsifiable concentrates ( ec ) ( mamboret confi and 
 ec - chemotcnica ( argentina ) , 70% wettable granule ( wg ) ( bayer 
 confidor , argentina ) and 10% spot - on ( bayer advantage g , 
 argentina ) .
moreover , 2.5% ec deltamethrin ( bayer k - othrine , argentina ) was 
 used only in surface bioassays . 

topical application bioassays - t. infestans first instars ( 5 - 7 days 
 old ) that had been starved since eclosion were selected for toxicity tests according to 
 the world health organization protocol ( who 1994 ) . the bioassays consisted of the 
 topical application of 0.2 l of the insecticide diluted in acetone on the dorsal 
 abdomen of the first instar using a 10 l hamilton syringe equipped with an automatic 
 dispenser . in the evaluation of blood feeding ,
nymphs were previously fed to repletion 
 on a pigeon and the insecticide was applied immediately after feeding .
the final concentrations of imidacloprid tested 
 ranged from 0.0025 - 0.5 mg / ml . all concentrations were replicated at least three times 
 with a minimum of 10 insects per replicate . to calculate the ld values at p  ⁇  0.05 ,
a 
 minimum of 30 insects per concentration was required and mortality values between 10 - 90% 
 were observed ( robertson et al .
mortality was evaluated after 24 h and also 
 after 48 h and 72 h in the delayed toxicity assays , by placing the insects on a circular 
 piece of filter paper ( 11 cm diameter ) and observing their ability to walk . only nymphs 
 that were able to walk from the centre of the filter paper to the border

distal radius fractures of the upper extremities are relatively common accounting for approximately 17% of all fractures in patients visiting the emergency room ( 1 ) . in recent years , osteoporotic fractures have become a major health issue ; and many studies have been done on relationship between distal radius fractures and osteoporosis .
however , there have been still controversies whether this relationship is statistically significant or not ( 2,3,4 ) .
also , the prevalence of low bone mineral density ( bmd ) and osteoporosis in patients with low - energy distal radial fractures compared with that of normal korean population without such fractures is not well known . in previous study , lee et al .
( 5 ) assessed age- and site - related bmd and the prevalence of osteoporosis in korean women with a distal radius fracture , and compared these with reference data derived from a study done in a large population - based cohort in korea ( 6 ) . for the study , they recruited only small number of 54 consecutive korean women , 50 to 79 years of age , with a distal radius fracture . however , in this study we recruited large number of 206 consecutive korean women patients . this study has shown that bmd is lower in patients with a distal radius fracture in women younger than 60 years of age or over 70 years of age than in normal controls .
in addition , low - energy distal radius fractures are predictive of future 15 years prior to osteoporotic hip and spine fractures ( 7,8,9 ) . considering these findings , it is important to analyze the relationship between bmd and distal radius fractures in postmenopausal women for the prevention of secondary fractures ( 10 ) .
the aim of this study was to compare the bmd and prevalence of osteoporosis of postmenopausal korean women with low - energy distal radius fractures with those of aged - matched normal korean women .
we retrospectively reviewed 206 patients who visited our hospital between march 2006 and march 2010 because of distal radius fractures .
inclusion criteria of this study were low - energy distal radius fractures caused by out - stretched injury of the wrist and postmenopausal women older than 50 years of age .
patients previously diagnosed systemic diseases affecting bone metabolism ( e.g. , metabolic bone disease , renal osteodystrophy ) or those who had been taken steroid for extended period were excluded from this study .
we also excluded patients with previous distal radius fractures , those with high - energy injuries caused by a vehicle accident or fall , those with pathologic fractures , and those who had previously diagnosed osteoporosis .
the bmd was measured at the spine and proximal femur using a lunar prodigy advance dual energy x - ray absorptiometry ( ge healthcare , madison , wi , usa ) . at the spine
, bmd values were obtained from the first to the fourth lumbar vertebral body . at the proximal femur
, bmd values were obtained from the femoral neck , ward s triangle , and the intertrochanteric area separately . for each area ,
the t - score and z - score , which represent differences in bmd from the maximum bone density of young and same aged people , respectively , were calculated . according to the diagnostic criteria of the world health organization ( who )
, osteoporosis was defined as any t - score lower than -2.5 , osteopenia as any t - scores between -2.5 and -1.0 , and normal bone density as any t - scores equal to or greater than -1.0 ( 11 ) .
patients were divided into three groups by age ; group 1 ( 50 - 59 years ) , group 2 ( 60 - 69 years ) , and group 3 ( 70 - 79 years ) .
the bmd values and prevalence of osteoporosis in each age group were compared with those of age - matched control .
the bmd values and prevalence of osteoporosis of the control were based on the reference data from healthy community dwelling korean population ( 6 ) .
these reference data were obtained from a study that used a large cohort of community dwelling korean women , 20 to 79 years of age .
this study included the entire female age group , including women with osteoporosis , and had 599 women 50 to 59 years of age , 894 women 60 to 69 years of age , and 313 women 70 to 79 years of age , and it provided age- and site - specific bmd reference values .
the equipment used in this study was dpx bravo ( ge healthcare , madison , wi , usa ) , which is small and measures only hip and spine bmd .
results are reported as means with standard deviations or frequencies with 95% confidence intervals ( ci ) .

the receptor for advanced glycation end products ( rage ) is a cell surface receptor of immunoglobulin superfamily .
rage activation through ligand binding can induce chronic inflammation and oxidative stress , and it has been linked with diseases like diabetic complications , cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases , and cancer . a soluble form of rage ( srage ) , which is a splice variant of full - length rage or a shedding / cleavage product of membrane - bound rage , has been found circulating in the plasma [ 2 , 3 ] . the srage can bind and sequester rage ligands and thereby can reduce rage activation .
therefore , the srage is generally considered as protective against diseases originating from rage activation [ 13 ] .
rage - ligand interaction was previously claimed to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes , and treatment with srage was shown to effectively prevent transfer of diabetes into nod / scid mice that receive spleen cells from a diabetic nod donor .
subsequently , blockade of high - mobility group box 1 , a rage ligand , was shown to inhibit insulitis progression and diabetes development in nod mice . a minor role of genetic variation in rage
was also suggested to be associated with insulin resistance ( ir ) in a human population .
however , recent studies have suggested that low levels of circulating srage may be involved in the development of diabetes mellitus [ 79 ]
. a declining level of srage at the time of seroconversion to autoantibody positivity has been suspected to be a predictor of type 1 diabetes [ 7 , 8 ] , and an independent association has been found between low levels of srage and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) . however , the relationship of srage with the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of t2 dm has not been specifically explored .
the ir and beta cell dysfunction are two core defects of t2 dm , and the prediabetes is a category of increased risk of developing t2 dm in subjects who have not yet fulfilled the criteria to be diabetic . to explore the involvement or participation of srage in the development of t2 dm ,
present study was designed to assess whether srage levels alter in prediabetes and correlate with ir and beta cell function in prediabetes and newly diagnosed t2 dm .
a total of 158 participants were recruited from those who came for diabetes screening at the bangabandhu sheikh mujib medical university , dhaka , bangladesh , after giving written consent .
this cross - sectional study was conducted according to the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the institutional ethical review committee .
participants were grouped as control ( normoglycemic ) , prediabetes , and newly diagnosed t2 dm based on their blood glucose ( fasting and 2 hrs after 75 grams glucose load ) and hba1c levels . as recommended by american diabetic association ( ada ) ,
diabetes was considered with a fasting glucose level 7.0 mmol / l and/or 2 hrs blood glucose 11.1 mmol / l and/or hba1c 6.5% ; and prediabetes was considered with a fasting glucose level 5.66.9 mmol / l ( impaired fasting glucose , ifg ) and/or 2 hrs blood glucose 7.811.0 mmol / l ( impaired glucose tolerance , igt ) and/or hba1c 5.76.4% .
subjects with previous history of diabetes and those suffering from hypertension , chronic liver and kidney diseases , or any other acute / chronic inflammatory conditions as well as pregnant and lactating women and regular drug users were excluded .
a detailed medical history was taken and clinical examination including height , weight , and blood pressure data were recorded for all subjects .
a fasting blood sample was collected after an overnight fasting of > 8 hours and a second blood sample was collected 2 hours after 75 grams glucose load on the same day from all subjects .
fasting and 2 hours after glucose levels were measured by enzymatic spectrophotometric method using dimension rxl max clinical chemistry analyzer ( siemens healthcare diagnostics inc . ,
hba1c levels were measured by ion - exchange high - performance liquid chromatography in a bio - rad d-10 instrument ( bio - rad laboratories inc . , hercules , ca , usa ) .
fasting serum insulin levels were measured by microparticle enzyme immunoassay technique ( abbott diagnostics , wiesbaden , germany ) using an abbott axsym system with an interassay coefficient of variation ( cv )  ⁇  5% .

according to numerous estimations , 15% to 29% of patients with cataract have 1.5 diopters ( d ) of refractive astigmatism.1,2 cataract surgeons usually prefer to treat cataract and correct refractive ( spherical and astigmatic ) disorders at the time of the surgery .
corneal incision ( astigmatic keratotomy ) and peripheral corneal relaxing incisions ( pcris ) were performed to treat these disorders.3,4 the main drawbacks of these approaches are that the outcome depends on multiple factors as the patient s age , the depth and length of the incision , complications related to wound healing , epithelial defects , or induction of dry - eye symptoms .
these parameters affect the visual outcome in a unpredictable way so the corneal incisions are not considered a reliable method for astigmatism correction .
toric intraocular lens ( iols ) implantation was introduced in the 1990 s as an option for astigmatism correction in cataract patients .
initially they presented the disadvantage of postoperative rotation that decreased the visual outcome.58 new toric iol designs ( acrysof toric iol ; alcon , fort worth , tx ) , approved by the us food and drug administration ( fda ) at the end of 2005 , have been found to be more stable and appear to be the preferred iol for correcting preexisting astigmatism in conjunction with cataract surgery.9,10 the acrysof iols are available in three options : t3 , t4 , and t5 of astigmatic correction 1.5 , 2.25 , 3.00 d , respectively ( at the iol plane ) .
the aim of this study is to report the clinical results of acrysof toric iols implantation for preexisting astigmatism correction and compare the postoperative rotation of the iols one and six months postoperatively .
this prospective study included eyes that had cataract surgery at the papageorgiou general hospital , thessaloniki , greece , between may 2008 and december 2008 .
the study was conducted according to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki and patients gave informed consent after the nature and intent of the study had been fully explained to them .
inclusion criteria were : cataract , age 70 years or younger , and preoperative regular corneal astigmatism greater than 1.00 d. exclusion criteria were : glaucoma , corneal disease , previous corneal or intraocular surgery , macular degeneration or retinopathy , and history of ocular inflammation .
each patient had a complete ophthalmologic examination , including visual acuity ( va ) , slit - lamp examination , intraocular pressure ( iop ) measurement , and dilated fundus examination .
topography ( magellan mapper ; nidek technologies , padova , italy ) , automated refractometry ( rk600 ; reichert , inc .
, depew , ny ) , and ultrasonic immersion biometry ( ocuscan rxp ; alcon ) were performed to determine the appropriate iol spherical power .
cylindrical power and axis placement to achieve emmetropia were calculated using an online toric iol calculator program ( available from http://www.acrysoforiccalculator.com/ ) .
the 0180 axis was marked with the patient in a sitting position to avoid cyclotorsion using the nuijts / lane preoperative toric reference corneal marker ( ae-2791tbl ; asico , westmont , il ) ( figure 1 ) .
intraoperatively , the desired implantation axis was marked using an intra - op toric axis marker ii ( ae-2794 ; asico ) ( figure 2 ) .
a foldable iol was implanted in the capsular bag through a 2.75 mm limbal incision on 110. the toric iol was injected with a monarch - ii injector ( alcon ) and placed around 1015 off axis before the ophthalmic viscosurgical device ( sodium hyaluronate 1% ) was removed .
after ophthalmic viscosurgical device removal , the iol was rotated to its final position by exactly aligning the toric reference marks with the limbal implantation axis marks .
all surgeries were performed by the same experienced surgeon ( it ) using topical anesthesia and a standard divide - and - conquer phacoemulsification technique . because of the intraoperative marker design and the pen mark fading during the operation in several cases , it was difficult to assess the proper alignment of the iol after its placement . because of this difficulty , an image was captured from the real - time streaming recording of the surgery and was assessed blindly by a second operator using a commercially available software ( screen protractor ; iconico , ny , usa ) ( unpublished

small cell carcinoma of the bladder is a very rare and aggressive histological subtype , and accounts for less than 1% of all bladder tumors.its management is challenging because it presents in the same way of other more frequent histological types , but with a high metastatic power .
the diagnosis demands that the pathologist be suspicious and accurate in the analysis of the fragments of a transurethral bladder resection ( tur ) .
multimodal treatment , including radical cystectomy , chemotherapy and radiation therapy should be initiated as soon as possible for a chance of cure and to improve survival .
this kind of carcinoma presents metastasis and has a poor prognosis . in the present article
we report a case of a male patient with small cell carcinoma of the bladder and the development of the condition , and we aim to show the most current management of this tumor , which has no consensus for treatment in the international literature for being extremely rare .
patient jhc , male , 61 years old , came to the medical service with a complaint of hematuria and hypogastric pain for one year .
the urinary tract ultrasound revealed an intravesical tumor , and he was submitted to bladder tur , with a conclusive report for small cell carcinoma of the bladder .
faced with the diagnosis , the attending team chose to perform chemotherapy ( received four sessions of cisplatin , gemcitabine and paclitaxel ) ( figure 1 ) . 

figure 1field with the presence of multiple mitoses , salt - and - pepper nuclei 
 when referred to our service , he was submitted to thorax and abdomen computerized tomography ( ct ) that showed a 6.2x6.0x5.5 cm neoplasm on the left anterolateral wall of the bladder , suggesting invasion of the prostatic urethra .
the patent was then submitted to radical cystectomy , with a bricker ileal derivation procedure , performed uneventfully , lasting 5 hours , with no need for blood transfusion .
it is important to underscore that the time between the last chemotherapy and surgery was 2 months .
the pathology report of the surgical specimen proved small cell carcinoma of the bladder with extravesical extension , perineural and vascular infiltration , and one lymph node affected ( left obturator ) out of 16 dissected .
the patient had pneumonia , was on antibiotics and was discharged 29 days after surgery .
he was referred to oncology to discuss adjuvant therapy which was not initiated , because the patient died 4 months after surgery due to pulmonary thromboembolism ( figure 2 ) . 

the first report of small cell carcinoma of the bladder was made in 1981 by cramer et al . since then , approximately 600 cases were registered in the international literature .
it is characterized by its high aggressiveness and poor prognosis , and by the development of metastic disease in about 67% of patients . 
 
the small cell carcinoma of the bladder usually affects individuals of the same age , sex and presents the same symptoms and morphology of urothelial carcinoma .
that is why it is a diagnostic challenge , depending only on the skills of the pathologist to differentiate it from urothelial carcinoma , which beside the factors already mentioned , has the same radiological aspect of small cell carcinoma of the bladder .
thus , recommendations are based on retrospective studies , reports of individual cases , and protocols for small cell lung carcinoma .
frequently , it presents with mixed histology.molecular studies show a common origin for small cell carcinoma of the bladder and urothelial carcinoma , when coexisting .
however , management should be different , since it frequently presents metastases and has a poor prognosis .
the pathological diagnosis of this kind of tumor is challenging and requires that the pathologist use immunohistochemical techniques for histological confirmation . as they are histologically identical , the world health organization standardization for small cell lung carcinoma is used .
it comprises the following criteria for diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the bladder : presence of group of small cells with scarce cytoplasm , few organelles , salt and pepper chromatin and high rate of mitoses ( > 10 mitoses/10 high power fields ) . 
 on immunohistochemistry
, these tumors express quite an amount of neurospecific enolase , chromogranin , synaptophysin and n - cam ( cd-56 ) .
the presence of one or more markers allows to establish the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor .
pathological staging is based on the consensus for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder ( figure 3 ) .

phakomatosis pigmentovascularis ( ppv ) is a rare condition first described by ota et al . , in 1947 .
there is no sex predilection , but the japanese are found to be affected more .
though four main types have been described , a fifth type with cutis marmorata and aberrant mongolian blue spot have also been added to the list .
a 13-year - old female presented with port - wine stain of left side of the body including face along the distribution of 5 cranial nerve , upper limb , trunk , and lower limb [ figure 1 ] . additionally , this lesion was present on right side of the back as well .
there was associated hypertrophy of the left lower limb with a visible vessel along the lateral aspect of the leg [ figure 2 ] .
ophthalmological examination showed raised intraocular tension in left eye but the right eye was normal .
the color doppler study of left lower limb showed absence of great and short saphenous vein .
an abnormal dilated vein on lateral aspect of leg and thigh was present which was seen to drain into superficial circumflex iliac vein [ figure 4 ] .
non - contrast computed tomography ( ct ) scan of brain showed focal parenchymal atrophy in the left parietal lobe region with foci of gyral calcification .
widespread port - wine stain involving left side of face and chest engorged vein over lateral aspect of left leg along with hypertrophy of lower limb bluish discoloration of sclera of left eye color doppler picture showing anomalous draining vein on lateral aspect of left leg
phakomatosis is a developmental abnormality simultaneously involving eye , central nervous system , and skin .
happle and steijen proposed the genetic concept of twin spotting phenomenon to explain its etiology .
ppv were classified into four types namely ; type i : nevus flammeus and epidermal nevus , type ii : nevus flammeus , mongolian spots , nevus anemicus , type iii : nevus flammeus , nevus spilus , nevus anemicus , type iv : nevus flammeus , mongolian spots , nevus spilus , nevus anemicus .
a , cutaneous involvement only ; and subtype b , both cutaneous and systemic involvement .
ppv type i , iii , and iv have very rarely been reported in literature .
systemic syndromes which may be associated with it are sturge - weber syndrome , nevus of ota , and klippel - trenaunay syndrome .
our patient had port - wine stain and nevus of ota and also had systemic involvement which tilted the diagnosis in favor of ppv subtype 
sturge - weber syndrome is defined as a facial port - wine stain with associated ipsilateral vascular malformation of leptomeninges and eye .
brain changes show increased vascularity of leptomeninges which is usually unilateral and long - term pathological changes show calcification and atrophy . here
our patient 's ct scan changes showed long - term changes like atrophy and calcification of parietal lobe of brain .
eye changes in the form of glaucoma and buphthalmos may occur . though definition of klippel - trenaunay syndrome include cutaneous capillary malformation of a limb and soft tissue swelling with or without bone hypertrophy , original description
indicate that varicosities of vein on affected limb is the usual finding and lateral venous anomaly is the most common abnormality .
clinical picture showing widespread port - wine stain and hypertrophy of lower limb along with abnormal color doppler finding , suggests the diagnosis of klippel - trenaunay syndrome .
thus , our patient fulfilled all the criteria for the diagnosis of ppv along with sturge - weber syndrome and klippel - trenaunay syndrome .
few cases of ppv along with sturge - weber syndrome have been reported in literature , but ppv associated with both sturge - weber syndrome and klippel - trenaunay syndrome has been reported very rarely . in our case report
we are presenting phakomatosis pigmentovascularis with sturge - weber syndrome and klippel - trenaunay syndrome which is so far very rare .

medulloblastoma , a primitive neuro - ectodermal tumor ( pnet ) arising in the posterior fossa , is one of the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system ( cns ) in children . overall survival for children with non - disseminated and non - anaplastic medulloblastoma can approach 80%.1 radiologic and histopathologic features include hyperattenuation on unenhanced computed tomographic scans that reflects the high nuclear - cytoplasmic ratio seen at histological analysis.2 medulloblastoma can also occur in late middle age with identical histopathologic findings to those found in childhood .
studies of chromosomal abnormalities , genetic syndromes , and individual genes have contributed to the understanding of medullblastoma biology.3 an infectious association with medulloblastoma was proposed in 2002 .
del valle et al demonstrated the presence of the human polyoma virus ( jcv ) t antigen ( tag ) , and agnoprotein dna in 65% and 69% of 20 and 16 medulloblastoma ffpe specimens , respectively.4 in an accompanying editorial polyomavirus and medulloblastoma : a smoking gun or guilt by association ?
 howard a. fine5 cautioned only through well - controlled epidemiological case - control studies evaluating large numbers of both normal and tumor - associated brains for the presence of jcv , will we have a chance of determining the relative contribution of the virus toward tumor promotion . over the years pcr findings have not confirmed a viral association with medullolastoma.6 - 9 brucellosis is caused by an intracellular gram - negative coccobacillus and produces lesions in multiple organs including the brain .
exposure to brucella species occurs through drinking or eating unpasteurized milk products , meat , or contact with infected animals .
cns brucellosis is rare . in a study of 19 patients in 1987 , 8 patients had meningoencephalitis , 6 had proximal polyradiculoneuritis , and 5 had diffuse cns involvement ( including one with cerebellar involvement).10 in a study of 301 brucellosis patients in 1992 , 18 had neurobrucellosis , two patients exhibited cerebellar dysfunction.11 in 2009 a 14 year - old girl presented with double vision . on mri examination a 5x3 cm mass
resection of the mass revealed a small blue cell tumor forming scattered homer - wright rosettes , characteristic of classic medulloblastoma .
initial igm for brucella was 0.78 (  ⁇  0.50 neg ) and igg was negative .
repeat igm was negative . in response to the parents who believed the mass was actually neurobrucellosis , the afip performed pcr testing for brucella sp dna in the tumor tissue .
surprisingly dna extracted from two formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded ( ffpe ) tissue blocks contained a 62 base pair ( bp ) sequence of dna found only in the outer membrane protein gene ( omp31 ) of brucella species .
specific primers / probes for b. melitensis , b. abortus , and b. suis did not produce a dna product from the two tumor blocks . in order to assess if brucella may have any association with medulloblastoma
, we retrieved ffpe blocks from brains of patients who died of medulloblastoma as well as blocks of brains from patients who died with other malignancies in the cns , and brains of patients without evidence of cns tumors .
this study showed an unexpected presence of brucella sp in ffpe cns tissues from patients who died from malignancy in the brain .
a total of 52 ffpe autopsy samples of brain tissues were collected from the pathology archives of the armed forces institute of pathology .
of the 31 , 20 were diagnosed as medulloblastomas , 5 as glioblastoma , 4 as metastatic carcinoma and 2 with leukemia .
fifty - two ffpe blocks were cut with a microtome ( 5 m in thickness , 3 sections per block ) . all cut - sections were collected into separate dnase - free eppendorf tubes and processed for dna retrieval as follows : ( i ) de - paraffinized by treatment with 800 l of xylene ( twice ) followed by removing xylene with 800 l of pure ethanol treatment ( twice ) ; ( ii ) tissue digestion and nucleic acids separation were carried out following a modified protocol of a qiagen kit ( cat # 51106 ) ; ( iii ) rna cleaning by incubation samples at 37c for 30 minutes with rnase a ( 100 mg / ml , qiagen ) and ( iv ) dna was purified by qiaquick column ( washing buffer 1 and 2 , qiagen

the centers for disease control and prevention estimate that more than 2 million individuals in the united states develop illness resulting from antibiotic - resistant infections on an annual basis and published antibiotic resistance threats in the united states , 2013 , which provides a snapshot of the complex problem of antibiotic resistance .
the threats were prioritized as urgent , serious , and concerning . of particular concern is increasing multidrug resistance coupled with cessation of antibiotic discovery programs by most major pharmaceutical companies .
this situation has created a major global health crisis in which there are few or no effective agents to treat common bacterial infections or infections caused by less common pathogens , including mycobacterium spp , , filamentous fungi , and yeasts .
, , furthermore , alternative second- and third - line agents that are effective are also associated with safety issues .
most current concerns about antibiotic resistance focus on infections in hospital settings requiring parenteral agents .
little is known about the activity of topical agents against multidrug - resistant organisms ( mdros ) , some of which are likely to be compromised because they contain agents to which resistance has already been reported .
these include neomycin , polymyxin b , bacitracin , and mupirocin . , bensal hp ( sonar products inc . ,
carlstadt , nj ) is a combination topical ointment with antimicrobial properties with activity against methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) and common bacterial and fungal skin pathogens .

in publications dating back several decades , irregularities in the morphology of the femoroacetabular articulation have been implicated as a possible source of hip pain in young , active athletes .
a french article published in 1979 described hip pain associated with structural abnormalities of the proximal femoral neck in athletes participating in hockey , football , soccer , rugby , martial arts , and tennis .
more recently , developments pioneered by open hip surgeons have shown that morphologic abnormalities of both the femur and acetabulum underlie a large number of labral and chondral injuries in the hip [ 1 , 29 ] .
wenger et al . noted the presence of osseous abnormalities , including dysplasia and femoroacetabular impingement ( fai ) , in the majority of patients with labral tears .
this suggests that isolated treatment of soft tissue pathologies may not be adequate without concomitantly addressing underlying structural abnormalities .
the concept of fai has been defined by ganz and colleagues [ 1 , 8 , 27 ] . in this condition ,
a structural or spatial abnormality of the femur ( cam ) or acetabulum ( pincer ) damages the chondrolabral structures during normal joint movement .
the most common situation is a mixed cam and pincer pathology , occurring along the anterior femoral neck and the anterior 
flexion and internal rotation movements , abutment and impingement of the labrum and cartilage occurs .
sub - clinical slipped capital femoral epiphyses [ 15 , 25 ] , mal - union of femoral neck fractures , and decreased femoral anteversion are described causes of cam impingement .
relative posterior opening of the acetabulum ( acetabular retroversion ) or global ( coxa profunda ) overcoverage of the femur by the acetabulum are described causes of pincer impingement [ 23 , 24 ] .
cam and pincer lesions lead to distinct patterns of labral and chondral damage [ 1 , 10 ] and long - standing impingement is likely a significant cause of previously described idiopathic hip joint degeneration .
ganz et al . developed an open surgical dislocation approach to decompress fai [ 7 , 13 ] .
however , we believe that an arthroscopic approach involves less post - operative morbidity and allows patients , including professional athletes , to return to high - functioning lifestyles . the purpose of this study was to define associated pathologies and determine if professional athletes could return to high - level athletics following arthroscopic decompression of fai .
a retrospective chart review was performed of all professional athletes presenting for arthroscopic treatment of fai by the senior author between october 2000 and september 2005 .
all athletes presented with debilitating hip pain and an inability to participate in their sport . all were diagnosed with fai based on physical and radiographic examination .
physical examination criteria included a positive impingement test or flexion abduction external rotation ( faber ) test .
a positive impingement test was defined as groin pain with 90 degrees of hip flexion and maximal internal rotation .
a positive faber test was defined as asymmetry in the distance between the lateral knee and the exam table between the injured hip and the non - injured hip .
radiographic criteria included decreased anterior and superior femoral head neck offset , acetabular retroversion ( as defined by a positive cross - over sign ) , or coxa profunda ( as defined by the medial acetabular border overlapping the ilioischial line ) .
for these athletes with documented physical and radiographic evidence of fai , conservative treatment was limited to only 6 weeks . based on evidence described by beck and colleagues ,
our thought was that conservative treatment could not address the underlying bony abnormalities and any further treatment delay in these highly active patients would likely precipitate further irreversible damage to the articular cartilage .
inclusion criteria for this study included professional athletes with at least one positive physical exam finding , at least one positive radiographic finding , and failure of at least 6 weeks of conservative therapy .
forty - five professional athletes from various sports met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study ( table 1 ) .

 malnutrition is one of the most important causes for improper physical and mental development of children .
one in every five children in the developing world is malnourished , and poor nutrition is associated with half of all child deaths worldwide .
malnutrition in children causes an increase in morbidity and mortality and has an adverse effect on intellectual ability .
globally , acute malnutrition causes more than 50% of childhood mortality in children under 5 years old , which implies that about 3.5 million children die of malnutrition each year .
weight - for - height ( wfh ) index ( figure 1 ) , height - for - age ( hfa ) index , weight - for - age ( wfa ) index ( figure 2 ) , body mass index , and skin fold thickness are to be used more frequently in the field . in april 2006 ,
the who released new global growth charts for infants and children as old as 5 years to replace the existing cdc / who international growth charts , which were based on the 1977 nchs growth charts .
the worldwide malnutrition estimation rates indicate that 35.8% of preschool children in developing countries are underweight , 42.7% are stunted , and 9.2% are wasted .
the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity has become a growing matter of public health concern worldwide .
obesity has increased from 4.2% , in 1990 , to 6.7% , in 2010 , worldwide and is expected to reach 9.1% , in 2020 [ 9 , 10 ] . in iran , like many of the other developing countries , the prevalence of obesity in children has been moving on . according to a survey in west azerbaijan , 8.7% , 7.5% , and 4.3% of the children aged less than five years suffered from stunting , wasting , and underweight , respectively . the present study aimed at assessing the prevalence of malnutrition ( underweight , stunting , wasting , overweight , and obesity ) in under - five - year - old children in salmas district .
the current study is a cross - sectional study which was conducted for assessing the nutritional status of children under 5 years old in salmas district on the basis of national guide and has been performed from 16 until 30 october , 2011 , with the cooperation of the office of community nutrition improvement and the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) . using cluster sampling ,
the statistical population included 059-month - old children residing in the cities and villages of salmas and by ena software sample size was calculated with 5% confidence interval ; 902 children were determined . in this study , children being mentally and physically retarded and having problems in terms of anthropometry were removed from the study and replaced by other children .
for medical ethics , the parental consent form must be completed to conduct completed design . in this study ,
first , the total number of households residing in rural and urban areas and the total number of children between 059 months in salmas city were cumulatively calculated .
then , in the ena software items , in the planning part , the desired items were entered into sample size calculation as follows : the number of children under 5 years old : 19824 people , estimate of the prevalence number of malnutrition : 8.7 , widespread confidence interval : 2.3 , design effect : 1.5.after entering the above information , 841 were determined as the sample size and , with 5% confidence interval for a sample sufficiency , the number of children was calculated as 885 children and , finally , in the study , 902 questionnaires were completed .
given that it was supposed to study 18 children in each cluster , 50 clusters were determined for this study . then , the ratio of urban and rural populations in salmas was calculated in this region ; the urban population was 49% and the rural population was 51% .
therefore , 26 rural clusters and 24 urban clusters were determined and in the next stage the names of all villages and urban blocks were separately entered into the part of selecting clusters in ena software according to the number of clusters .
the required data were collected through measuring the height and weight and arm circumference of the children in the study , completing the questionnaire and interviews with mothers or caregivers of children .
the scale used in this study was a single pan balance with the maximum capacity of 150 kg and accuracy of 100 gr . if possible , the child was directly weighed .
if the baby was too small or cried so hard , first , the mother was weighed alone and then hugged the child .

, he had a large ( 10 cm 10 cm 5 cm ) occipito - cervical swelling , that was soft and nonfluctuant , and transillumination was negative .
the boy had no neurological deficits and no signs or family history of nf-1 . in neuroimaging studies ,
the lesion was seen as an isointense on t1-weighted and heterogeneously hyperintense mass on the t2-weighted image and heterogeneous enhancement mass on postcontrast study [ figure 2 ] .
there were multiple small underlying bone defect in the right occipital region [ figure 3 ] .
the excision was total , and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) leak was seen on bone defect site , so periosteum was buried on bone defect site for preventing the csf leak .
histopathological findings in hematoxylin and eosin staining were showing focal myxoid generation and spindle cells , with serpentine nuclei and wispy cytoplasmic border suggestive of pnf .
t1-weighted with postcontrast sagittal magnetic resonance image shows heterogeneous enhancement lesion in the scalp of the right occipital region and nape of neck ( a and b ) both photographs showing three - dimensional computerized tomography skull showing thing of occipital bone right - sided with multiple bone defects
after that pnf of scalp reported by ohaegbulam . in general , pnfs are found in association with nf ( in 26.7% of patients ) .
pnf is usually found along the course of a major nerve trunk , the ophthalmic division in the face .
it is an unencapsulated lesion and infiltrates the surrounding soft tissue to produce a fusiform appearance .
it usually involves one large segment of the body and may involve both sides of the body either symmetrically or asymmetrically .
the patient in this report had a pnf with nf and with telangiectatic discoloration of the overlying swelling , with multiple caf au lait spots on the left upper and lower trunk .
only nine reports were found in the literature , of these nine , one case had nonoperative management , and two had only a biopsy . in the initial description by helmholtz and cushing , as detailed by scott , the location of the pnf was at the forehead and temporal region . it was suggested then that there was a propensity for the forehead and the temporal region , especially the area of the scalp innervated by the trigeminal nerve .
although the forehead and the distribution along the course of the trigeminal nerve are the most common location , there have been a few reports of the pnf occurring at the occiput detail given in table 1 ; pnf occurs with slight male preponderance ( male / female 7:5 ) .
most reported cases have been congenital , but presented later in life due to apprehensions of a social or psychosocial nature , mostly previous reported cases , there was only thinning of the occipital bone with no true dysplasia .
review of literature of occipital neurofibroma nf is generally considered to be a neurocutaneous disorder of neural crest origin with very little emphasis on osseous abnormalities , although osseous dysplasia is one of the seven criteria for diagnosing nf-1 .
most of the osseous lesions are thought to be secondary to the altered functioning of the nf-1 gene .
besides true dysplasias , the secondary involvement of the bones may be due to compression of the malignant tumors seen in association with this disorder , such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath

malignant melanoma rarely affects the breast , accounting for less than 5% of all malignant melanomas .
malignant melanoma of the breast has various manifestations : primary cutaneous melanoma , primary glandular melanoma , metastatic melanoma , and in - transit metastases to the breast .
primary cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast shows similar clinical features to melanomas arising from other cutaneous areas .
it follows different metastatic patterns than do primary carcinomas of the breast and require a different therapeutic approach .
wide local excision with sentinel lymph node ( sln ) biopsy is the most important therapeutic modality in preventing local recurrence .
malignant melanoma is an immunogenic tumor and adjuvant immunotherapy is indicated in high risk patients .
common metastatic sites are brain , lung , liver and overall prognosis is very poor in metastasis .
herein , we report a case of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast in a 59-year - old woman and discuss the clinicopathologic features and treatments in correlation to the literature data .
a 59-year - old woman was admitted with a black pigmented skin lesion in the right breast .
she mentioned that the lesion had appeared at birth but grew rapidly and bled recently .
the lesion was 2.0 1.5 cm in size and located on the periareolar skin in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast which is not associated any breast mass ( fig .
the axillary lymph node was not palpated and there was no nipple discharge or retraction .
she underwent incisional biopsy a week earlier at a local breast clinic and was diagnosed with malignant melanoma .
the specimen was an ulcerative , pigmented lesion , measuring 1.0 0.6 cm in size and 0.25 cm in thickness ( pt3b ) .
careful examination of the other skin and mucous membranes revealed no areas suggestive of a malignant melanoma .
brain computed tomography ( ct ) and positron emission tomography - ct showed no evidence of metastasis .
she underwent wide local excision of the lesion , including removal of normal appearing skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue to provide a safety margin ; and subsequent sentinel lymph node biopsy ( slnbx ) using the technetium ( tc)-99 m phytate was performed .
grossly , the specimen revealed a sharply defined , black pigmented lesion , measuring 1.9 1.6 cm in size including normal skin 2 cm apart from the tumor margin and subcutaneous tissue ( fig .
microscopic findings showed intraepidermal tumor cells and nests that were laterally spreading in a pagetoid manner and tumor nests invaded the superficial dermis 0.12 cm in thickness ( pt2a ) ( fig .
tumor cells often had large nuclei and nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm with brown - black pigments ( fig .
the resection margins were free of tumor cells and there was no regional lymph node metastasis ( pn0 ) .
the final pathologic stage considering incisional biopsy report was iib ( t3bn0m0 ) according to the 7th edition of the american joint committee on cancer classification .
three years after surgery , the patient is alive and shows no signs of local recurrence or distant metastasis .
the incidence of malignant melanoma has risen sharply over the last decade and can occur anywhere on the body .
it occurs most commonly on the extremities in females and on the trunk in males .
malignant melanoma of the breast is classified into primary melanoma of the breast skin or gland , and metastatic melanoma to the breast from an extramammary site .
cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast is a rare tumor , accounting for less than 5% of all malignant melanomas and primary cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast is particularly rare .
reported that cutaneous malignant melanoma showed different manifestations in the breast not only at initial presentation but also during the follow - up periods of each patient .
to date , several cases of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast have been reported in the west but have not yet been reported in korea .
exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation is the major environmental risk factor and the presence of host factors including skin pigmentation , sensitivity to the sun and large numbers of nevus are strongly associated .
bono et al . reported cutaneous malignant melanoma prefers the upper inner quadrant of the breast and this finding is consistent with an etiologic role for sun exposure . in the present case ,
the lesion was also located in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast . in comparison to primary cutaneous malignant melanomas arising from other areas , neither the symptoms nor the physical findings of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast present any characteristic pattern .
however , in cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast , mmg and/or us should be obtained to reveal the breast lesion that is considered a metastatic lesion . in our case ,
if malignant melanoma occurs

tissue culture methods and irradiation procedure have been described in . the three dimensional tissue culture model
( 3d epioral ) and media were purchased from mattek corporation ( ashland , ma ) .
the 3d epioral tissue is a co - culture organotypic model and consisted of human fibroblasts on the bottom and human oral keratinocytes grown on top of the fibroblasts . in order to induce differentiation and stratification of the keratinocytes of the 3d cultures ,
then the tissues were irradiated ( dose of irradiation was 0 , 2 , or 12 gy ) at the city of hope ( duarte , ca ) facility .
subsequently the tissues were incubated for 6 h at 37 c with 5% co2 after irradiation .
then one of the tissues was placed in 10% formalin for histopathological studies and the others were used for the extraction of total rna .
the rneasy plus mini kit ( qiagen , germantown , md ) was used to extract total rna of at least two identically treated tissues .
the integrity and quality of rna was determined by evaluating the a260/280 absorbance ratio using an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer ( agilent technologies , palo alto , ca ) . only rna samples with absorbance ratio , a260/280 > 2.0 , and rin > 
the rna was converted to double - stranded cdna and amplified using in vitro transcription with t7 polymerase ; the transcription reaction included aminoallyl utp ( aa - dutp ) and the subsequent product was conjugated to cy5 nhs ester ( ge healthcare life sciences , pittsburg , pa ) . the human whole genome onearray v4.3 ( phalanx biotech , san diego , ca ) was used to perform the dna microarray analysis .
for this purpose , a quantity of 0.025 mg / ml fragmented cy5-labeled cdna was hybridized overnight at 42 c using the hybbag mixing system with 1 onearray hybridization buffer ( phalanx biotech ) and 0.01 mg / ml sheared salmon sperm dna ( promega , madison , wi ) . after the hybridization procedure
the raw cy5 intensity signals produced by each of the microarrays were captured using a molecular devices axon 4100a scanner and measured using genepix pro software and stored in gpr format .
the data from all the arrays of each experimental set were analyzed using rosetta resolver system ( rosetta biosoftware , usa ) .
testing was done in triplicate by combining technical replicates while the statistical analyses were done using the proprietary modeling techniques of rosetta resolver .
the error - weighted approach ( which is specifically geared towards combining replicated hybridizations to improve measurement precision and accuracy ) was used to calculate the average expression values . in order to decide whether intensity data was significantly above background , p - values
were calculated to test the null hypothesis that expression is absent ( called p - value detected ) . a p - value detected  ⁇  0.05 indicated that the transcript specific to a given probe was truly present or expressed .
lastly , we also calculated p - values for determining whether genes were differentially expressed . rather than focusing solely on fold changes ,
rosetta resolver uses error - model - based hypothesis tests , which account for both fold change and expression level .
three technical replicate hybridizations were averaged while ensuring that the technical replicates were of high repeatability . using the r function boxplot , raw and normalized log2 data from each sample were plotted but we did not include control and flagged probes .
this analysis not only helps finding hybridization with aberrant intensity distributions but also helps to confirm that the normalization of each replicate microarray has an appropriately centered distribution . for each sample
the scattered plots of raw and normalized log2 data were compared using the r function pairs .
pearson correlation tables were used to define the linear relationship of the two variables , raw and normalized data , in the scatter plots . for each technical repeat , we calculated correlation values for raw and normalized log2 intensities and we included in the calculation only probes with p - value of  ⁇  0.01 .
scatter plots showed that technical replicates had high repeatability and all the correlation values were > 0.953 .
our article , , emphasizes the differentially expressed genes of tissues that received different amounts of radiation ( i.e. 0 , 2 , or 12 gy ) , while herein we show the profiling of all the transcriptomic data resulting from these treatments .
we only used genes with | fold change | > 1.5 and p - value  ⁇  0.05 .
we input gene symbols into david bioinformatics , while throughout we used the default

periprosthetic joint infection ( pji ) is a devastating complication seen in total joint arthroplasty ( tja ) patients .
it could lead to prolonged hospitalization , repeated surgical intervention , significant permanent deformity , or even definitive loss of the implant .
the symptoms of pji are often nonspecific , which makes the diagnosis of pji quite challenging . in caring for a painful joint arthroplasty ,
the ability to distinguish between septic and aseptic failures of the prosthesis is critical as the treatment for pji necessitates unique surgical strategies that aim to eradicate the infecting organism(s ) .
traditionally , the hematological diagnosis of pji is performed by measuring inflammatory factors of white blood cell ( wbc ) levels , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) , and serum c - reactive protein ( crp ) .
in addition , microbiology analysis of synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue using histology and synovial fluid culture and imaging tests such as enhanced computed tomography bone scanning , magnetic resonance imaging , and positron emission tomography are also used . however , some of these results are nonspecific for pji , and the test results have to be combined with the clinical history and symptoms ; thus , a more specific and sensitive routine for pji diagnosis is required . to address the inconsistency of different tests , the american academy of orthopedic surgeons ( aaos ) published their first guideline in 2010 as a reference for the diagnosis of pji , in which esr and crp were used as screening tests and joint aspiration
should be performed when the level of these markers are elevated . then , in 2012 , the musculoskeletal infection society ( msis ) renewed with a consensus statement providing a concise definition of a pji .
although the msis definition provides a standard for definitive retrospective diagnosis and research , its complexity makes it difficult to use in daily clinical practice .
the ideal method of pji diagnosis would be a single test or panel that is highly sensitive , specific , and simple to interpret .
in recent years , researches on pji diagnosis have started to focus on synovial fluid instead of serum , since synovial fluid is the site of primary infection , and the diagnosis should be more sensitive than that of serum theoretically .
studies have revealed that number of antimicrobial peptides and inflammatory cytokines including crp , interleukin ( il)-1 , il-6 , il-17a , interferon- , tumor necrosis factor- , defensin , cathelicidin ll-37 , and so on in synovial fluid could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis .
crp is a protein that has long been measured in the serum as an indicator of infection , and it has already become a well - known protein in the orthopedic community . until now , several studies have suggested that the crp levels in synovial fluid may serve as a simple and cost - effective means for improving the diagnosis of pji as the local crp is thought to enhance complement activation and phagocytosis .
however , there are also studies concluded that crp from synovial fluid does not offer a diagnostic advantage in the detection of pjis after comparing the value of synovial fluid crp with serum crp . to address this controversy
, we believe that establishing a prompt , precise , and convenient diagnostic guideline based on current evidence , consensus , expert opinions , and reviews is necessary .
therefore , in this study , we aim to conduct a meta - analysis to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of synovial fluid crp for diagnosing pji .
ultimately , this will improve the management of patients with pji as an effective treatment of pji requires an accurate and quick diagnosis .
to the best of our knowledge , our study is the first meta - analysis that evaluates the clinical utility of synovial fluid crp in the diagnosis of pji . in our study , we compared the diagnostic performance of synovial fluid crp with the consensus - based guidelines .
the methodological approach to evidence searching and synthesis described in this protocol was based on the cochrane collaboration 's diagnostic test accuracy methods . in our study
, we performed a literature search , screened the studies identified , and selected the studies that meet the eligibility criteria .
we then extracted the data from the selected studies and assessed the eligible studies by means of the revised quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies ( quadas-2 ) criteria .
statistical analysis , evidence synthesis , and report compilation were carried out as the steps below .
we strictly adhered to standards of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta - analyses in reporting the findings of this review .
we searched the electronic databases including pubmed , embase , web of science

systemic chemotherapy can lead to a variety of ocular complications , such as cicatricial ectropion , nasolacrimal duct stenosis , conjunctivitis , keratitis , cataract , macular edema , retinopathy , and optic neuropathy ( 1 , 2 ) .
although bulbar perforation with orbital cellulitis has been reported in an immunocompromised patient , corneal perforation has not been documented in patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy ( 3 ) .
we report a case of corneal perforation with preseptal cellulitis in a patient treated with systemic chemotherapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia ( all ) .
a 17-yr - old female patient undergoing systemic chemotherapy for all was referred to our hospital due to swelling and pain of the right upper lid for two days .
laboratory examination showed leukocytes 40 cells/l , erythrocytes 3.610 cells/l , hemoglobin 10.8 g / dl , hematocrit 30.6% , and thrombocytes 3310 cells/l .
the patients received induction chemotherapy ( vincristine , prednisolone , daunorubicin , and l - asparaginase ) .
there were no abnormal findings , other than diffuse swelling of the right upper eyelid .
artificial tear eye drops were used for the treatment of superficial punctate erosions . on the 12th day
, spontaneous bloody and purulent discharge from the upper palpebral conjunctiva occurred in the right eye .
systemic antibiotics ( meropenem ) were maintained per the antibiotic sensitivity test . on the 16th day ,
periorbital swelling decreased , however , corneal melting and perforation with iris prolapse was noted in the right eye ( fig .
seven months after surgery , visual acuity in the right eye was 20/300 , and intraocular pressure was 14 mmhg .
ocular complications associated with systemic chemotherapy can be divided into complications in the adnexa , anterior segment , and posterior segment .
previously reported complications in the anterior segment include conjunctival injection , conjunctivitis , corneal edema , keratitis , and corneal opacity ( 1 , 2 ) .
anticancer agents such as cytosine arabinoside , 5-flurouracil , carmustine , deoxycoformycin , and tamoxifen have been known to cause corneal toxicity ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ) . in our case ,
vincristine , prednisolone , daunorubicin , and l - asparaginase were used for combination chemotherapy . to the best of our knowledge , corneal toxicity associated with these anticancer agents has not been reported .
serratia marcescens , a motile , gram - negative coccobacillus , is an emerging opportunistic pathogen noted for causing urinary , respiratory , blood stream , and ocular infections ( 6 ) .
preseptal cellulitis in the present case was caused by s. marcescens because the patient was immunocompromised .
extracellular protease produced by s. marcescens is considered a major corneal destructive factor . in an experimental study of rabbit cornea ,
serratia protease preparations have caused rapid and extensive liquefactive corneal necrosis , descemetocele formation , and corneal perforation ( 7 ) .
it is possible that s. marcescens in the purulent discharge directly invaded the cornea with superficial punctate erosions and caused corneal melting and perforation in the immunocompromised patient .
this hypothesis is supported by two facts : first , s. marcescens is a virulent organism .
second , corneal melting and perforation occurred in the area in direct contact with the infected upper palpebral conjunctiva . in conclusion
, physicians should consider the possibility of serious ocular complications , such as severe bacterial keratitis or corneal perforation in cases of preseptal cellulitis caused by a virulent organism , particularly in immunocompromised patients .

microleakage is one of the most important reasons for the secondary decay , inflammation , and necrosis of the pulp . in resin composite restorations
, microleakage occurs between cavity wall and restorative materials usually due to the polymerization shrinkage .
composition of the bonding agents is one of the most important prerequisites to ensure a good seal and stable adhesion to the tooth tissue .
the purpose of adding a solvent to the dental bonding agent is to dilute it to create a thin layer on the surface of etched tooth , and displacement of water from the collagenous network and penetration of resin monomers into these spaces .
although the presence of the solvent in bonding agent is necessary , the entire solvent must be completely eliminated from bonding before curing the bonding agent because its presence can have adverse effects on polymerization of the resin monomers .
when the solvent 's concentration is too high , reduced photoinitiator concentration and occupation of spaces between the monomer molecules will cause a reduction in the conversion of monomers to polymers and reduces the mechanical properties and strength of the bonding .
therefore , after bonding resin applications , the solvent is removed from the resin using air - stream .
acrylate in dental adhesives makes an important contribution in polymerization and creating an appropriate bonding . on the other hand , polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes ( poss )
poss as cross - linking agents in bioadhesive acrylate affect the contractile behavior and improve their physical and mechanical properties .
observing the hybrid layer with scanning electron microscope , reported that among the different concentrations of ethanol as solvent ( 10% , 30% , and 50% ) , the concentration of 30 wt% was the optimum percentage of the solvent and concentrations of less than 10 wt% and over 50 wt% resulted in poor quality hybrid layer .
holmes et al . reported that in a resin matrix which prepared with six different concentrations of acetone and ethanol , the highest conversions of monomer to polymer were observed in acetone and ethanol with concentrations of 5 mol and 2.5 mol , respectively .
however , in higher concentrations of the solvents , the polymer conversion rate was reduced quickly so that at 13 mol approached zero . as the solvent concentration plays an important role in the efficiency of dentin binding agents ,
the present study was designed to evaluate the effect of ethanol concentration as a solvent in experimental acrylate - based dental adhesives containing poss , on the microleakage of dental composite restoration .
in this experimental study , 42 extracted sound noncarious human premolars without restorations , abrasion , and cracks were selected and stored for 2 months in 0.2% thymol solution before performing the study .
standard class v cavities ( h w d = 3 4 2 ) were prepared with 0.8 mm cylindrical diamond burs using a high - speed handpiece and water coolant in the buccal and lingual sides with the occlusal margin in enamel and the cervical margin in dentin .
the teeth were randomly divided into 6 experimental groups of 7 . in all groups , teeth were acid etched by 35% phosphoric acid gel ( ultradent , usa ) for 15 s , rinsed for 15 s and blot - dried for 2 s. in group 1 , as the control group , adper single bond , 3 m , usa was used the adhesives of all the test groups contained di and trimethacrylate monomers , poss , and photoinitiator system but the concentration of ethanol , as the solvent , in groups 2 through 6 varied and was 0% , 20% , 31% , 39% , and 46% by weight , respectively .
the adhesives were prepared in iran polymer and petrochemical institute , tehran , iran . the adhesives were applied and light cured for 20 s at an intensity of 600 mw / cm ( litex 695c , taiwan ) .
cavities in all control an test groups were restored with filtek z350 nanocomposite ( 3 m espe , usa ) in 3 increments .
each increment of composite resin was cured for 40 s. finishing and polishing were done with flamed shaped polishing bur and disks ( soflex , 3 m espe , usa ) .
all samples were thermocycled between 5c and 55c for 1000 cycles . then , wax was used to seal apics of all specimens .
all the surfaces of teeth up to 1 mm around the restorations were covered with two layers of nail varnish .
then , specimens were immersed in 2% basic fuchsine ( merck , germany ) solution at room temperature for 24 h. the teeth were then rinsed thoroughly with distilled water .
cnc cutting section machine ( fanavaran pars , iran ) was used to section the specimens

the enclosure of eukaryotic genomes within the nuclear envelope evolutionarily generated the necessity to transport macromolecules selectively between nucleus and cytoplasm .
following their synthesis in cytoplasm , histones and nucleic acid polymerases have to reach the nucleus , while specifically cytoplasmic proteins have to be kept out .
mature mrna , trna and rrna molecules and their associated proteins have to follow the opposite route , while their immature precursors have to be kept in 1 . , 2 . , 3 . , 4 . , 5 .. eukaryotic mrna is enzymatically metabolized and compacted with proteins within nuclei to generate functional messenger ribonucleoprotein ( mrnp ) particles 6 .
, 7 .. the control of protein biosynthesis involves regulation of intranuclear functions with participation of specific proteins , many of which seem to enter from the cytoplasm as a time - specific event 3 . , 4 . , 5 .
, 7 .. the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( hnrnps ) comprise a group of important regulators engaged in these cellular processes 8 . , 9 . , 10 .. extensive research efforts have been devoted to the cloning and molecular characterization of numerous ribonucleoproteins ( rnps ) in the context of their active role in mrna biogenesis and metabolism 1 .
, 2 . , 9 . , 10 . , 11 . , as well as in terms of their involvement as autoantigens in human diseases ( 11 ) .
hence , emphasis is put on the roles of various rna - binding motifs and their subsequent roles in governing cellular activities , both in health and pathology ( 9 ) .
recently , there has been considerable interest in the participation of these rna - binding particles in triggering the immune response in human autoimmune disorders ( 11 ) .
substantial research both at cdna and protein level have been performed on immunochemical features of human autoantigens ( http://www.zoo.uni-heidelberg.de/mol_evol/mb/ana_base.html ) .
of particular interest is the group of mammalian hnrnps , which constitutes a part of spliceosome , which itself is an autoimmune target ( 12 ) .
novel nucleotide sequences are continuously reported , which afterwards are used to delineate homology among various members based on previously determined nucleotides and protein sequences .
the mechanism of contribution of numerous hnrnps with a similar structural rnp motif ( 13 ) to the induction of different immune reactions is sequence - specific ( 14 ) .
phylogenetic approach is essential to find functionally important genomic sequences based on detection of their high degree of conservation across different species .
such approach shows the level of improvement of the prediction of gene - regulatory elements in the human genome .
this necessitates the study of the degree of homology of rna recognition motifs ( rrm ) among these proteins , requiring an evolutionary computation .
having considered the importance of submitting new sequences for further functional characterization , the newly cloned and expressed cdna of previously unknown member of the hnrnp a / b family of proteins ( figure 1 ) is presented here .
its rna - binding properties and tissue - specific gene expression profiles were recently determined ( 15 ) . based on the concept of correlation between sequences and rna - binding modes , a systemic search was performed for nucleic acid association by evaluating sequence conservation using multiple sequence alignments search tools .
the aim of the presented work herein was to isolate novel cdna sequences with important functional implications in human pathology .
our efforts have been devoted to the cloning and subsequent tissue - specific gene expressions of numerous human rnps from the hnrnp a / b family of proteins ( figure 1 ; ref .
the objective was to search for molecular basis of autoimmunity by applying comparative analysis of the sequences of diverse autoantigens . in this context
, evolutionary computation approach could give us major clues on how evolutionarily conserved mrna transport machinery fails are linked to development of human autoimmune disorders .
we were mainly interested in cdnas , which might encode the yet undescribed hnrnp b2 .
the need for this was based on two observations . on the one hand , autoantibodies directed against hnrnp a2 crossreact with hnrnp b1 and hnrnp b2 . since hnrnp b1 is an alternatively spliced variant of hnrnp a2 , this suggests that hnrnp b2 might be an alternatively spliced form of hnrnp a2/b1 .
however , no attempts to clone a cdna encoding hnrnp b2 were

the first macrolide , erythromycin , was discovered in 1952 and since then macrolides have had an important role in treating infectious diseases ( kirst , 2002 ) .
erythromycin had moderate activity against gram - positive pathogens , while the newer semi - synthetic derivatives azithromycin , clarithromycin , and ketolides have broader antibacterial activity .
macrolides , lincosamides , and streptogramins ( mls ) , though chemically distinct , are usually considered together because most share overlapping binding sites on the 50s subunit of the ribosome and many bacteria carry acquired resistance genes which confer resistance to more than one drug within this group ( sutcliffe and leclercq , 2003 ) .
these antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis by binding within the exit tunnel , adjacent to the peptidyl transferase center , and inhibit translation by preventing progression of the nascent chain inducing peptidyl - trna drop off ( auerbach et al . , 2010 ; starosta et al . ,
different antibiotics within the mls group interact and bind with different rrna residues which may account for why a bacterium may be resistant to the macrolide erythromycin but susceptible to semi - synthetic erythromycin telithromycin ( bulkley et al .
however for most bacteria acquisition of new genes coding for ; ( a ) rrna methylases which generally results in resistance to macrolides , lincosamides , and streptogramin b antibiotics ( mlsb ) ; ( b ) two types of efflux pumps which pump the drug(s ) out of the cell ; or ( c ) one of four types of inactivating enzymes which chemically modify the antibiotic preventing it from binding to the ribosome that is the most important way they become mls resistant ( table 1 )
data taken from following http://faculty.washington.edu/marilynr/ vga(a)lc is a variant of vga(a ) but it is worth separating in table 2 because it is the only recognized variant because of it is extended range in conferring resistance to streptogramin a and lincomycin ( novotna and janata , 2006 ) and variants confer resistance to lincosamides , streptogramin a , and pleuromutilins ( kadlec and schwarz , 2009 ) ; has been shown to confer resistance to lincosamides , streptogramin a , and pleuromutilins ( kadlec and schwarz , 2009 ) ; confers resistance to lincosamides , oxazolidinones , streptogramin a , phenicols , and pleuromutilins ( phlospsa ) but not macrolides .
tetracyclines are one of the oldest classes of antibiotics and the first broad spectrum class of antibiotics
. bacteria may become resistant to tetracyclines by mutation , while the majority of bacteria become tetracycline resistant because they acquire new genes which ; ( a ) pump tetracycline out the cell ( efflux ) ; ( b ) protect the ribosome from the action of tetracyclines ; or ( c ) enzymatically deactivate tetracyclines ( table 2 ) .
tetracyclines interact with the bacterial ribosomes by reversibly attaching to the ribosome which blocks protein synthesis .
tet ( u ) has been sequenced but does not appear to be related to either efflux or ribosomal protection proteins ; tetb(p ) is not found alone and teta(p ) and tetb(p ) are counted as one operon ; tet(x ) and tet(37 ) are unrelated but both are nadp - requiring oxidoreductases : tet(34 ) similar to the xanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase genes of v. cholerae;not related to other tet efflux genes ; tet(37 ) , tet(43 ) .
different classes of mls and tetracycline ( tet ) resistance genes are defined as having  ⁇  79% amino acid identity with all previously characterized genes .
two genes are of the same class if they share > 80% amino acid sequence identity over the entire length of the protein . for a tet or a mls resistance gene to be assigned a new gene designation , it has to be completely sequenced and its amino acid composition compared with all currently known classes .

rare fungi have recently been implicated in human infections ranging from colonisation to invasive fungal infections ( ifis ) in immunocompromised patients , accounting for  ⁇  10% of all isolated fungal pathogens.1 
 pseudozyma species ( spp . )
are basidiomycetous yeast classified in the family ustilaginaceae , and its members are close relatives of ustilago maydis and other smut fungi .
infections in humans have rarely been reported after the first description as a human pathogen in 2003.3 data regarding the clinical characteristics and pathogenicity in humans remain insufficient .
recently , we experienced a case of pseudozyma aphidis fungaemia with invasive fungal pneumonia after reinduction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia ( aml ) . here , we describe this case and review the global literature .
mary 's hospital approved this case report and waived the need for patient consent ( no .
a 51yearold man who was diagnosed with aml and had not experienced remission after the first induction chemotherapy started reinduction chemotherapy with 100 mg m cytarabine for 7 days and 90 mg m daunorubicin for 3 days . on day seven after reinduction chemotherapy ( d7 ) , neutropenic fever ( up to 38.0 c ) developed as measured using an axillary thermometer .
laboratory data included a white blood cell count of 220 l ( absolute neutrophil count , 0 l ) and creactive protein level of 8.60 mg dl .
empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftazidime ( 2 g twice a day ) and isepamicin ( 400 mg once a day ) was initiated after performing blood cultures .
on d8 , the results of the blood culture revealed presumptive growth of grampositive cocci ( gpc ) .
teicoplanin ( 12 mg kg a day after loading with 12 mg kg every 12 h for three doses ) was added based on the culture results .
although the patient had no respiratory symptoms , infiltration was suspected in the right lower lung field on the chest radiograph on d9 .

the patient received fluconazole instead of posaconazole as the primary antifungal prophylaxis ; because he had participated in a clinical trial using a thrombopoietin receptor agonist during the same period , a drug interaction was possible .

it has been well established that patients with end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) undergoing hemodialysis ( hd ) had a higher association of peripheral arterial disease ( pad ) , lower extremity amputation ( lea ) , and foot ulcerations ( fu ) [ 13 ] . such an association could be attributed to a common atherosclerotic cause . moreover ,
diabetic patients with esrd had a 10-fold increased risk of lea in comparison to diabetes patients without renal insufficiency .
several studies have reported increased rates of lea among esrd patients , irrespective of the concomitant presence of diabetes mellitus ( dm ) [ 46 ] .
the mechanism of fu development is multifactorial which depends upon various physiological , mechanical , and treatment factors .
reported significantly higher incidence of foot complications in patients with concomitant esrd and dm in comparison to those who had only dm suggesting a possible relationship between esrd and fu .
in addition , lea and fu are well established complication of diabetic nephropathy [ 8 , 9 ] .
margolis et al . observed a strong correlation between progressions of chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) with the development of diabetic fu .
game et al . also demonstrated a close association of fu and amputations in diabetic patients started to undergo dialysis .
performed a meta - analysis to look for the relationship of diabetic fu with cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) and all - cause mortality .
the authors found an increased association of cvd and mortality in diabetic patients with fu in comparison to those without fu .
interestingly , a recent study advocated a higher incidence of risk factors ( pad and peripheral neuropathy ) for fu among hd patients . in qatar , an earlier report from our center identified a high incidence of pad in hd patients .
however , there is a lack of information that describes the risk factors and prognostic implications of fu among hd patients in the arab middle east .
we aim to evaluate this association and its impact on the outcomes over a 5-year period .
we conducted a retrospective analysis of all hemodialysis patients enrolled at the hd unit at hamad general hospital ( hgh ) , qatar , over five years ( 20072012 ) duration .
patients surviving for at least 3 months on the initial hd were included in the study .
hd patients were categorized into two groups according to whether they had foot ulcer ( fu ) or not ( no - fu ) based on physical examination .
the attending physician in the hd unit collected the data regarding the demographics characteristics , clinical evaluation , medical history , and comorbidities . during the follow - up period over 5 years , hd - related procedures such as vascular access ( arteriovenous fistula , arteriovenous grafting , and tunneled catheter ) , renal transplantation , and vascular complication were also reported .
the need for 3 vascular accesses ( due to mechanical obstruction , poor flow , or infection ) had been analyzed .
we speculated that hd patients with fu had poor outcomes compared to no - fu patients .
the study end - points ( major amputation , vascular complications , and mortality ) were also subanalyzed according to the presence or absence of dm and pad .
fu was defined according to the clinical findings as a full thickness skin break below the level of malleoli .
patients were considered to have pad if they had one of the following criteria : abi  ⁇  0.9 , history of intermittent claudication , vascular bypass or endovascular intervention for occlusive vascular disease , or amputation due to occlusive vascular disease .
major amputations were defined as amputations proximal to the ankle joint , and minor amputations were defined as those through or distal to the ankle joint .
diabetic nephropathy was diagnosed during patient follow - up in the nephrology out - patient clinic according to the patient chart .
it was defined as presence of macroalbuminuria that is a urinary albumin excretion of more than 300 mg in a 24-hour collection or macroalbuminuria and abnormal renal function as represented by an abnormality in serum creatinine , calculated creatinine clearance , or glomerular filtration rate .
analyses were conducted using the student 's t - test for continuous variables and pearson chi - square ( ) test for categorical variables .
multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for predictors of development of fu and mortality . adjusted odds ratios ( or ) , 95% ci , and p values
a significant difference was considered when the two - tailed p value was  ⁇  0.05 .
data analysis was carried out using the statistical package for social sciences version 18 ( spss inc . ,

dilated cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) is the most common form of primary cardiomyopathy and is a leading cause for heart transplantations approximately 30%50% of affected individuals have a familial form of dcm . to date
, at least 40 disease genes have been reported to be associated with familial dcm , in which ; mutations of scn5a gene which encodes the alpha subunit of the major sodium channel in the heart have been demonstrated to result in myocardial damage and dcm [ 4 , 5 ] .
previously , scn5a has been implicated in conduction disturbances and several electrophysiological phenotypes [ 6 , 7 ] , including atrioventricular block ( avb ) , long qt syndrome , sick sinus syndrome , sudden infant death syndrome , and atrial fibrillation [ 8 , 9 ] . meanwhile
, more and more scn5a mutations were discovered to be related with dcm , such as a1180v , d1275n , w156x , r225w , and r222q .
we first reported finding a1180v , a single nucleotide mutation , c.3539c > t , that occurred in exon 20 of the scn5a gene in a three - generation chinese family with age - related dcm and progressive avb in 2008 . in that study , a1180v was detected in all studied patients and in six younger unaffected members of the pedigree .
experimental data revealed that a1180v channels exhibited a negative transform of voltage - dependent inactivation of the cardiac sodium channels , which lead to a rate - dependent sodium current reduction , and a moderate increase in late sodium current . correspondingly , our clinical study revealed qrs widening at high heart rates and qtc prolongation at rest in unaffected carriers .
these findings suggest that a1180v is a functional mutation that can contribute to the development of dcm .
however , data deposited in the dbsnp database show that a1180v has been found in two small sample groups of the asian population . in the first sample group , a1180v
( dbsnp refsnp number , rs41310765 ) was present in a cohort of 47 han people ( r31_hanla ) who were part of the los angeles panel at a carrier frequency of 6.4% . in another sample group ( her_asian - panel ) of 16 individual asians
selected from the coriell cell repository , genetic sequencing yielded a carrier frequency of 6.2% ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/snp/snp_ref.cgi?rs=41310765 ) . to date , the data obtained from the dbsnp database show that a1180v is virtually absent in other ethnic groups .
thus , these unpublished data suggest that a1180v might be a common variant in asians , which is inconsistent with our previous observations . in order to further evaluate the pathogenic role of a1180v in familial dcm and make sure the frequency of a1180v among healthy han chinese
, we followed up the three - generation chinese family and expanded the control size to screen for a1180v . besides , we analyzed its frequency in other database as well .
we followed up all the a1180v carriers and noncarriers of the three - generation chinese family for 6 years .
all individuals were interviewed with the symptoms of cardiovascular disease , such as typical chest pain , palpitation , cyanosis , and syncope .
12-lead electrocardiogram ( ecg ) and echocardiography were performed on the family members to make a diagnosis .
460 unrelated healthy han chinese living in shanghai , ranging from 20 to 70 years old , were enrolled to the control group from a national high technology research and development program ( the national 863 program ) of china .
individuals with known cardiovascular risk factors other than age , gender , and smoking history were excluded .
the enrolled participants did not show any abnormalities under comprehensive clinical evaluation , including review of medical history , physical examination , 12-lead ecg , submaximal exercise ecg , and blood biochemical examinations .
each of the participants and individuals whose data are included here signed an informed consent form after a complete and clear explanation of the nature and purpose of the study .

however , studies have shown that surgery is best done during normal working hours . given the pressures on theatre use
it is important to be able to assess the retinal detachment and to ascertain the urgency of planning surgical intervention .
one of the most important features is the involvement of the macula and fovea that is macula on or macula off . in cases of macula - off retinal detachments ,
macula - on retinal detachments , however , should have their surgery expedited , the main concern being the conversion to a macula - off situation which has a much poorer visual prognosis .
the assessment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments is multifactorial ; in an otherwise normal eye visual acuity is an easy measure of macula involvement with the 6/60 patient being macula off and 6/6 macula on .
similarly the onset of symptoms and the age of the retinal detachment is important , as chronic detachments can be more stable and surgery can be safely delayed .
also the extent of detachment and position of the retinal break can also help predict the progression of an acute macula on retinal detachment .
however , in certain situations the macula - on or macula - off question is not easily answered ; visual acuities may be misleading ; examination of the detachment may be difficult due to poor views often due to vitreous hemorrhage and chronicity may be difficult to ascertain in patients with vague histories .
high - speed spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( oct ) offers a noninvasive tool to evaluate retinal microstructural changes in a number of eye pathologies .
newer systems using spectral domain calculations have improved data acquisition speeds compared with conventional time - domain oct equipment allowing much greater axial resolution .
given the greater resolution a number of characteristic changes seen in retinal detachment have been observed . in this paper , we discuss two cases where spectral domain oct and an understanding of the histological changes have enabled a clearer diagnosis and planning of treatment .
our first case is a seventy - five - year - old gentleman who presented with a vague history of blurred vision for six weeks .
visual acuity was 6/24 and examination revealed a pseudophakic inferotemporal macula - off retinal detachment .
the reduction in visual acuity was thought to be secondary to vitreous haemorrhage as biomicroscopy assessment showed the detachment stopping inferior to the macula ( figure 1 ) . to confirm the macula status ,
contrary to the biomicroscopy examination ( figure 1 ) , this revealed a macula - off retinal detachment ( figure 2 ) .
changes seen in the oct scan were characteristic of an old retinal detachment with the presence of intraretinal cysts , undulation of outer retinal layers , and the hyper - reflectivity in the photoreceptor layer ( figure 2 ) .
secondary to these oct findings , the surgical session was deprioritised and performed five days later .
the surgical repair consisted of a three - port pars plana vitrectomy with perfluoropropane tamponade and cryotherapy .
subsequent spectralis oct one year following the retinal detachment shows restoration of normal retinal morphology with resolution of the intraretinal cysts , flattening of the retinal layers , and no hyperreflectivity seen ( figure 3 ) .
our next case was a fifty - year - old myopic female who presented on a friday with a several - month history of floaters and visual distortion described as 
microstructural analysis of the macula was performed using a heidelberg spectralis oct scan which confirmed a macula - off retinal detachment ; however , the oct scan revealed that the fovea was bisected by this detachment ( figure 4 ) .
moreover , the macula microstructure seen in the oct scan showed no retinal folds or hyperreflectivity present near the fovea .
indeed , the only morphological retinal detachment changes observed which indicated any chronicity were small intraretinal cysts present peripherally away from the fovea ( figure 4 ) .
given the oct findings , she was treated as a macula - on retinal detachment patient , and surgery was expedited such that an emergency theatre session was organised within 24 hours on a saturday morning .
the surgical repair was a three - port pars plana vitrectomy using a sulphur hexaflouride tamponade and cryotherapy .
after subsequent cataract surgery , vision had returned to 6/6 with normal oct findings ( scan not shown ) .
the morphological changes seen in retinal detachment have previously been evaluated by oct and are becoming clearer with newer systems using spectral domain calculations , which have improved data acquisition speeds to  ⁇ 40 000 a - scans per second allowing much greater axial resolution to approximately 3.5 m tissue resolution .
the transformations seen in retinal detachment include intraretinal cyst formation , intraretinal separation , and undulation of outer retinal layers [ 3 , 4 ] .

in most cells , proteostasis 
 involves continuous regulation of protein 
 synthesis and degradation , but the eye lens is a notable exception . during the final stages of maturation , lens cells 
 eject all organelles , preventing normal protein turnover .
the lens therefore provides a unique opportunity 
 to observe the effects of aging in relation to damage accumulation 
 in long - lived proteins , which are increasingly a subject of interest .
they constitute 
 approximately 3540% of the total soluble mass of the lens 
 and are composed of a 3:1 ratio of a to b . while a is found almost exclusively in 
 the lens , b has been found throughout the body including heart , 
 glia , muscle , kidney , lung , and skin cells .
gene knockout studies revealed that a mouse lens can develop normally 
 without b but not without a , which led to prompt cataract 
 formation .
nevertheless , the chaperone activity of 
 heteropolymers formed from a 3:1 ratio of a to b is 
 higher than either homopolymer , suggesting that the combination of 
 both proteins is optimal .
beta and gamma 
 crystallins are the two other major subgroups of crystallins in the 
 lens .
they act in conjunction with the -crystallins to maintain 
 lens structure and transparency and to achieve a suitable refractive 
 index . to behave properly as chaperones , 
 -crystallin monomers must 
 interact with each other to form polydisperse oligomers .
a 
 and b form dimers that then assemble into larger complexes 
 ranging from 15 to 50 monomers , with the subunits dynamically intermixing 
 and exchanging .
removing 
 the n- and c - terminal extensions allows for determination of partial 
 crystal structures .
when crystallins do not interact 
 with each other properly , they become water - insoluble and begin to 
 aggregate .
the influence of many post - translational modifications 
 ( ptms ) on this process has been investigated , including deamidation , 
 oxidation , disulfide formation , and truncation .
importantly , all of these ptms lead to mass shifts that are easily 
 detectable by mass spectrometry ( ms ) .
more subtle modifications 
 that also increase with age , such as 
 isomerization and epimerization , do not lead to easily detectable 
 mass shifts and have been significantly less studied .
methods for detecting isomerization in peptides ( meaning either 
 inversion of the chiral center of an amino acid to produce an epimer 
 or conversion of aspartic acid to isoaspartic acid ) include stereoselective 
 enzymatic digestion , ion mobility , and ms .
previous studies have 
 shown that aspartic acid and serine are the two amino acids most susceptible 
 to spontaneous isomerization .
deamidation 
 of asparagine residues generates aspartic acid , and this transformation 
 can also be accompanied by isomerization .
the mechanism by which l - asp converts into l - isoasp , d - isoasp , and d - asp has been studied previously and is known to proceed via 
 nonenzymatic formation of a succinimide ring , which can yield four 
 isomers , as shown in scheme 1 .
enol tautomerism and then hydrolyzed to form d - asp or d - isoasp . the mechanism 

by which l - ser epimerizes to d - ser in proteins is 
 not well - established , although proposals have been made .
alpha and beta carbons are 
 labeled to highlight the difference between l - asp and l - isoasp , respectively . although isomerization 
 might appear to be a
ptm , studies have shown it can cause major perturbations in protein 
 structure . noguchi and coworkers successfully crystallized hen egg - white 
 lysozyme with an isoaspartic acid substitution at asp101 that caused 
 backbone deflection of nearly 90 relative to the native structure .
crystal structures of a modified ribonuclease 
 revealed that isoasp-32 induces conversion of an -helix to 
 a u - shaped loop .
isomerization not only 
 perturbs 3d structure but also can affect physical properties such 
 as solubility and bioactivity .
for example , isomerization of asp92 
 in immunoglobulin 2 ( igg2 ) leads to deactivation of the antigen - binding 
 region .

obesity is a worldwide phenomenon , with an incidence increasing in parallel with obesity - associated diseases such as insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes mellitus , and hypertension .
the combination of obesity and hypertension places patients at a higher risk of hypertensive end - organ damage and vascular events [ 2 , 3 ] .
blood pressure ( bp ) is subject to diurnal variation , and studies using ambulatory bp monitoring ( abpm ) have demonstrated the clinical significance of disturbances in the diurnal bp profile and have associated nondipping with a progression in end - organ damage [ 4 , 5 ] .
moreover , a nondipping pattern of bp has been reported to occur in several conditions that are frequently associated with obesity .
although body mass index ( bmi ) is associated with the severity of ambulatory hypertension and an increase in daytime bp , bmi does not reflect body fat distribution .
epicardial adipose tissue is related to visceral fat , rather than total adiposity , and shares microcirculation with myocardial tissue and coronary vessels [ 6 , 7 ] . because elevated bp is associated with ectopic fat accumulation in the intrathoracic and epicardial areas , a possibility of association of epicardial adipose tissue with hypertension as well as diurnal bp patterns [ 10 , 11 ] has been found in some recent studies [ 8 , 9 ] .
epidemiological studies have found that epicardial fat is two to three times more common among females than males and that excessive body weight increases the risk of diabetes mellitus ( dm ) and cardiovascular diseases approximately one - and - a - half to two times higher in women than it does in men .
furthermore , a higher prevalence of hypertension among overweight adults is found in women than in men , which may indicate different susceptibilities based on gender . given these facts
, we aimed to investigate the influence of obesity on the association between epicardial fat thickness ( eft ) and circadian bp changes in patients with recently diagnosed essential hypertension ( eh ) , with a gender subgroup analysis .
this cross - sectional observational single - center cohort study included patients who underwent 24 h abpm and echocardiography between january 2008 and october 2013 .
demographic characteristics recorded at the first visit included age , sex , height , weight , medication , smoking history , and other diseases .
blood was drawn for measurement of total serum cholesterol , triglycerides , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) and low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol , blood glucose , creatinine , uric acid , and high sensitivity c - reactive protein ( hs - crp ) .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as the ratio of dry weight in kilograms to height squared ( in square meters ) .
a total of 441 consecutive patients , who underwent office bp measurements , 24-hour abpm , and laboratory measurements for cardiovascular risk factors and echocardiography , were analyzed .
following the recommendations of the european society of hypertension , a normotensive state was defined as a mean daytime ambulatory systolic and diastolic bp  ⁇  135/85 mmhg by abpm , associated with
true ht was assigned if the average daytime bp was higher than 135/85 mmhg and the average nighttime bp was above 120/75 mmhg .
obesity was defined as a bmi above 25 kg / m , as per the korean society for the study of obesity .
the patients with the following diseases were excluded from the study : secondary hypertension , significant liver disease , neurologic disorder , malignant disease , valvular heart disease , heart failure , and history of acute coronary syndrome , myocardial infarction , coronary revascularization procedure , carotid revascularization procedure , ischemic leg ulcer , peripheral revascularization , or amputation .
because the presence of type 2 dm is known to be associated with increased eft regardless of obesity [ 6 , 7 ] , we also excluded overt type 2 dm from the analysis to avoid its possible confounding impact on the association between eft and circadian bp variability in our hypertensive patients with or without obesity .
office bp measurements were performed using an automated device ( easy x 800 ( r / l ) , jawon medical , seoul , korea ) .
measurements were taken after patients had rested for 10 min in a sitting position , with the arm comfortably placed at the heart level .
each set of two measurements was averaged to give the office systolic and diastolic bp .
abpm was performed on each patient 's nondominant arm using an automatically oscillometric device ( tonoport v ,

the dental industry has a long history in the development of dental prostheses to recover a patient 's tooth function.1 as a substitute for teeth , a dental prosthesis must show stable durability , aesthetic value , precise function , and convenient use , as well as biocompatibility in order to perform the desired function properly . in addition , these factors must be applied to a wide range of manufacturing methods used in the construction of dental prostheses.2 metal ceramic is a very common material used worldwide , and it has been successfully used as the gold standard for long - term clinical use ; it provides excellent results in stability , aesthetic value , and marginal adaptation.345 in recovery using a dental prosthesis , marginal adaptation is an important factor.3 an inappropriate margin could cause a minute gap between the abutment tooth and prosthesis , which may lead to a periodontal lesion , plaque accumulation , secondary caries , microleakage , inflammation after endodontic treatment , or periodontal disease.5678 in addition , according to previous research , a defective margin may cause a failure of the long - term preservation of the prosthesis , resulting in an increase in the failure rate.9 conventional fabrication methods for a prosthesis is a series of processes that includes taking an impression of the patient 's oral cavity , pouring stone , producing a wax pattern , and performing the investing , casting , and polishing .
however , during this process , the risk of inaccuracy may increase due to the properties of the material used and the worker 's ability .
in addition , temporal labor and cost could increase as well.1345 therefore , to address these problems , an automated cad / cam system was introduced to the dental field.15 the cad / cam system is a type of subtractive manufacturing that cuts the materials to the desired shape and size .
it enables a larger quantity of production than traditional methods , is easy to use , and saves the time . because of these advantages , the cad / cam system is widely used.5 however , bornemann et al.10 showed that this system tends to reduce accuracy through the scanning process , software design , milling , and a number of other related processes .
this results in too much consumption of raw material , and the waste of bur was increased .
accordingly , the additive manufacturing ( am ) method , which supplements labor - intensive conventional manufacturing methods and subtractive manufacturing methods with high raw material consumption , is being considered a technology - intensive alternative in the field .
multi - jet modeling , an additive manufacturing process used in the dental field , is the 3d printer , which is very advantageous in terms of manufacture speed and applicability with various materials compared with other 3d printings , as it has a number of jet nozzles.11 as a very professional 3d printer , a newly - launched additive manufacturing process " micro - sla " is characterized by high accuracy , and thanks to its minute ability in realization it is more appropriate for manufacturing the dental prosthesis than any other printers .
also , compared to the other 3d printings , it is cheaper and speedy printing ( 14 mm / hour on the basis of the vertical standard ) is possible to shorten the time required . as a disruptive technology ,
am has the potential to revolutionize our lives , work , and international economy.12 only a few companies are applying am to dentistry , and , therefore , there are a limited number of studies done in this field . identifying the limits and advantages of this manufacturing method is an important task in the prosthesis and dentistry fields .
thus , the purpose of this study was to verify whether the marginal and internal gap of a prosthesis made according to the am method is within the clinically allowable range by conducting a comparative evaluation of the conventional lost wax technique ( clwt ) , the subtractive manufacturing system with wax blank milling ( wbm ) , and am with multi jet modeling ( mjm ) and micro - stereolithography ( micro - sla ) .
the null hypothesis was that there is no difference in the marginal and internal gap among the 4 groups .
an acrylic model ( standard working model ag-3 zpvk 13 , 14 , 16 , frasaco gmbh , tettnang , germany ) with abutment teeth was used .
therefore , the maxillary right canine , first pre - molar , first molar were provided with a 360 1.0 mm chamfer preparation.13 the incisal and occlusal reductions were 1.5 - 2.0 mm .
the maxillary right canine , first pre - molar , first molar were reproduced using duplication silicone ( deguform , degudent gmbh , hanau , germany ) . in the reproduced area , the epoxy

this may be spontaneous or secondary to mechanical factors like vigorous scratching or combing the hair .
a 19-year - old female patient presented with short , rough , and unruly hair on the scalp since childhood .
patient gave a history of knots getting caught in fine - toothed comb whenever the scalp was combed with breakage of few hairs .
there was no history of excessive cosmetic use or parlor activities for hair care . on examination ,
the scalp hairs were dry , curly , and short in length up to the nape of neck , transverse split ends ( trichoschisis ) were seen in majority of hairs [ figure 1 ] .
microscopic examination of the hair shaft revealed knotted portions of hair ; no other shaft abnormalities were noted except for trichoschisis at the distal portion of the shaft [ figure 5 ] .
short curly hair on the scalp small nodules on the distal portion of hair shaft sparse hair in the temporal region trichonodosis and trichoschisis in light microscopy
there are two types , one rare variety of unknown etiology involves abnormally growing scalp and body hair with spontaneous trichonodosis which is predisposed to splintering and fracturing . the second commoner type , encountered in patients with normal scalp and body hair , is considered secondary to mechanical forces such as combing and brushing .
the hairs in this type are dry and curly , but no abnormality in structure or growth pattern occurs .
rarely , more than one knot is found on a single hair and most were a simple half hitch knot .
when the hair of subjects with trichonodosis was combed or brushed , knots were observed to catch in fine toothed combs and to a lesser extent , in brushes . in those with extensive trichonodosis ,
breakage usually occurred at the knot , but proximal breakage and several uprooted telogen hairs were also seen .
kinky hair tends to be flat in cross section , whereas curly or straight hair is oval to round .
these flat or ribbon - shaped hairs do not lie flat on a level surface but remain spiral .
this recoiling may lead to an entanglement which , by chance , forms a knot that results in trichonodosis .
mechanical factors such as scratching , combing , washing or friction may produce tangling and knotting of hairs .
the pubic and thigh regions are most frequently involved since curliness of the hairs in those areas predisposes them to knotting .
if the knots are pulled excessively tight , transverse splintering of the hair shaft and simulation of trichorrhexis nodosa may result .
these knots resemble the ova of body , head and pubic lice and light microscopic examination is necessary for differentiation .
the nodules in trichonodosis are located distally , whereas the ova are located in the proximal shaft .
acquired type of trichonodosis due to mechanical factors is a common occurrence but reported less in literature .
spontaneous type of trichonodosis associated with abnormal scalp and body hair is a rare occurrence .
this type starts at an early age and hair breaks away after a particular length due to the fracture of hair shaft at the knot .
trichonodosis must be considered when patients with kinky hair complain of hair loss or breakage , and the cause is not apparent .

in the year 2003 immunosuppressive therapy using mitoxantrone has been approved for treatment of patients with worsening relapsing - remitting or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( ms ) in germany .
due to potential side effects on the heart and bone marrow the cumulative dose of mitoxantrone was initially limited to 100 mg / m and later on extended to 140 mg / m in selected cases .
however , systematic data on the course and incidence of cardiac toxicity following low - dose mitoxantrone are lacking . in the following ,
we report about serial cardiac evaluation in 30 consecutive patients before , during , and after mitoxantrone treatment in consecutive patients with ms . in the years 2006 and 2008 ,
parts of the study have been published in german language in journals which are not indexed by pubmed [ 1 , 2 ] .
from january 2003 to july 2004 , thirty consecutive patients with secondary progressive or worsening relapsing multiple sclerosis were treated with mitoxantrone at 3-month intervals .
it was agreed among the participating physicians that termination of treatment due to cardiac reasons was limited to clinical heart failure only .
mitoxantrone infusion as well as cardiac evaluation before , during , and after treatment was performed by a cardiologist .
all patients were treated ambulatory and received a pneumococcal vaccination before treatment was initiated . in the following we focus on the cardiac evaluation of mitoxantrone infusion . prior to each treatment , all patients underwent a careful history taking , laboratory testing , a resting electrocardiogram ( ecg ) , and a transthoracic cardiac ultrasound . on all occasions , mitoxantrone at a dose of 12 mg / m diluted in 250 ml saline was infused over a period of 30 minutes . 
the electrocardiogram was obtained by a digital 12-channel system ( custo cardio 130 , ottobrunn ) in recumbent position .
cardiac imaging was performed using a digital ultrasound system ( vivid 3 , general electrics , solingen ) .
cardiac chamber measurements ( mm ) , calculation of fractional shortening ( fs% ) , and respective ejection fraction ( ef% ) were done on m - mode images only ; values were determined as an average of three consecutive measurements .
global assessment of cardiac function and valvular disease was performed on two - dimensional views .
the relation between ef , fs , lvedd , and heart rate with the cumulative mitoxantrone dose was analyzed using linear regression analysis with random coefficients ( software sas 9.1 , proc mixed ) .
the course of each patient was linearly modeled and the population average ( trend ) estimated respecting age and gender .
30 consecutive patients ( 23 female , 7 male ) with a mean age of 47 10 years were treated with mitoxantrone . no patient had received mitoxantrone , a mediastinal radiation , or any cancer treatment before the present mitoxantrone therapy .
three patients suffered from noninsulin - dependent diabetes ( 10% ) , 2 patients from essential hypertension ( 7% ) , and 4 patients from depression .
prior to mitoxantrone treatment 8 patients had been treated with interferon ( 27% ) , 3 with azathioprine ( 10% ) , 1 with glatiramer acetate ( 3% ) , 2 with interferon and azathioprine ( 7% ) , 1 with glatiramer acetate and interferon ( 3% ) , and 1 with immunoglobulins ( 3% ) . in 4/30 patients
mitoxantrone therapy had been started during hospitalization elsewhere ( 9 courses ) and continued mitoxantrone treatment as all other 26 patients ambulatory .
all reported data refer to the data obtained in all 30 patients during ambulatory treatment only .
mitoxantrone was infused 222 times with a mean cumulative dosage of 83 37 mg / m ( minimal dose 24 mg / m , maximal 156 mg / m ) .
treatment frequency ranged from 2 to 13 infusions per patient and extended over a mean period of 23 13 months ( minimal 3 , maximal 53 months ) . during therapy with mitoxantrone 3 patients ( 10% ) experienced an acute episode of relapsing symptoms , one after the first course , one after the 4th , and one after the 5th course of mitoxantrone . in two of these 3 patients ,
an additional high - dose course of intravenous steroids was administered . at the terminal mitoxantrone infusion 5/30 ( 17% )
reported about amelioration of ms symptoms as compared to symptoms at the start of therapy , 19/30 ( 63% ) about no change , and 6/30 ( 20% ) about worsening symptoms .

cellular adaptation requires biochemical processes including post - translational mechanisms to modify existing proteins . catalyzed by opposing kinases and phosphatases , reversible phosphorylation of serine , threonine , and tyrosine residues is now appreciated as a fundamental regulatory mechanism with the majority of phosphorylation ( > 99% ) occurring on serine and threonine residues [ 1 , 2 ] . due to their untapped therapeutic potential ,
protein phosphatases have been identified as promising targets for xenobiotic manipulation through rational drug design ( reviewed in [ 36 ] ) . in particular ,
the ubiquitously expressed protein phosphatase 2a ( pp2a ) has been proposed as a target for the treatment of a number of pathologies ranging from neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer disease to a variety of neoplasias [ 79 ] . 
compared to other members of the phosphoprotein phosphatase ( ppp ) superfamily of serine / threonine phosphatases , a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which pp2a recognizes substrates and mediates site - specific dephosphorylation remains to be developed . sequence and structural homology of the catalytic subunits of ppp family members
has revealed a conserved catalytic mechanism in which a divalent metal cation activates a water molecule to hydrolyze phospho - serine / threonine without the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate ( reviewed in [ 1012 ] ) . despite a shared catalytic mechanism , substrate specificity within the ppp family
for example , the ppp calcineurin ( also known as protein phosphatase 2b ) has been shown to interact with two consensus sequences , pxixit and lxvp , found on nonsubstrate - interacting proteins and target substrates ( reviewed in [ 11 , 13 ] ) . for protein phosphatase-1 ( pp1 ) , substrate specificity is conferred by incorporation of pp1-interacting proteins via a conserved docking motif with a general consensus sequence of rvxf ( reviewed in [ 11 , 12 ] ) . at present , consensus sequences in pp2a substrates have not been identified .
this review will focus on our emerging understanding of pp2a substrate specificity , which appears to involve additive effects of multiple discrete interactions . 
pp2a is a highly conserved serine / threonine phosphatase which , depending on the tissue of origin and cell type , may account for up to 1% of cellular protein and the majority of serine / threonine phosphatase activity .
the physiological functions of pp2a have been implicated in all facets of cellular existence ( reviewed in ) .
further , pp2a functions as a critical tumor suppressor whose interruption leads to proliferative diseases .
the heterotrimeric holoenzyme is composed of a catalytic subunit ( c ) a scaffold subunit ( a ) and one member of four families of regulatory subunits ( b ) ( figure 1 ) .
the diversity of pp2a heterotrimers is achieved through expression of two c subunits , two a subunits and approximately fifteen b subunits in vertebrates .
the b subunits are derived from four diverse gene families ( b , b , b , and b ) that have little sequence similarity between families but maintain high sequence similarity within families .
the b family ( b55 , pr55 , ppp2r2 ) of regulatory subunits consists of four genes ( , , , ) , the b - family ( b56 , pr61 , ppp2r5 ) is comprised of five isoforms ( , , , , ) , the b family ( pr72 , ppp2r3 ) includes three isoforms ( /pr72/130 , /pr59 , /pr48 ) , and the b family ( pr93/pr110 ) is made up of three proteins ( sg2na , striatin , and mmob1 ) .
there is some controversy as to whether the b family members , most notably sg2na , are bona fide pp2a regulatory subunits that always associate with the ac dimer or whether they are merely regulated by association with the pp2a dimer .
given the large number of pp2a subunits , it is thought that each cell expresses a dozen or more distinct holoenzyme complexes which act on a diverse array of substrates .
pp2a holoenzyme diversity has been the subject of several excellent papers [ 14 , 15 , 18 ] . like pp1 , regulatory subunit incorporation is thought to dictate the substrate specificity of the pp2a complex , however , only recently have molecular studies begun to develop insight into the mechanism by

nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases in the worldwide and it is associated with chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease .
nafld is associated with insulin resistance and is defined as fat accumulation in liver , exceeding 5% of liver weight , in the absence of ethanol intake > 10 g / day .
the first one is about the development of insulin resistance that explains the effect of insulin resistance in nafld .
the second theory is increased inflammation which can lead to nafld . in a study conducted in japan
, a significant relationship was observed between the level of serum c - reactive protein ( crp ) and risk of nafld .
however , in another study , no significant correlation was seen between serum crp and nafld .
vitamin d is a fat - soluble vitamin that exists in a number of food products such as oils and dairy products .
vitamin d is traditionally known as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism , but in recent years a significant relationship has been observed between serum levels of vitamin d and risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases .
vitamin d receptors are present in more than 38 tissues and its receptors affect genes controlling oxidative stress and inflammation .
there are several lines of evidence demonstrate an association between vitamin d and liver disease .
however , in several studies , there were no association between vitamin d concentration and severity of fatty liver .
the effect of vitamin d on its receptor in these cells regulates and balances the inflammation and oxidative stress .
moreover , several studies have confirmed the relationship between serum vitamin d levels and inflammation . due to the role of inflammation in nafld ,
hence , the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin d supplementation on inflammation in patients with nafld .
a randomized double - blind placebo - controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients ( 30 - 70 years ) with nafld .
samples were calculated with a confidence interval of 95% and 80% power of the test by below formula ( s = 1.7 , d = 0.7 ) .
this study was conducted in metabolic liver disease research center in isfahan university of medical sciences , isfahan , iran .
the study was performed with the approval of isfahan university of medical sciences local ethics committee .
exclusion criteria in our study were defined as acute illnesses , chronic kidney disease , hyperparathyroidism , hypoparathyroidism , chronic heart failure , hepatitis c or hepatitis b , wilson syndrome , history of chronic liver diseases , or disorders that affect gallbladder and bile ducts , pregnancy or history of taking any drugs affecting levels of alt including ( valproic acid , tamoxifen , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl - coenzyme a reductase inhibitors , metformin , angiotensin - converting enzyme 1 and angiotensin - converting enzyme - related 1 ) .
subjects should not intake oral vitamin d / calcium / multivitamin supplementation in the previous study .
participants were divided into two groups using permuted block randomization : ( a ) 30 patients in vitamin d group ( capsules containing 50,000 iu vitamin d ) , ( b ) 30 patient in the placebo group .
intervention period followed for 10 weeks and patients received vitamin supplements or placebo capsules every week . to evaluate the acceptability of vitamin d supplementation , serum 25-hydroxy vitamin d level was measured at the beginning and end of the study .
dietary records were collected every 2 weeks , and intakes were determined based on estimated values in household measurements . to obtain nutrient intakes of participants on the basis of these 5-d food diaries , nutritionist iv software ( version 7.0 ; n - squared computing , salam , or , usa ) , which was modified for iranian food items were used .
physical activity levels estimated as metabolic equivalent of task hours per week ( met - hr / wk ) .
met - hr / wk for each exercise program calculated ( days per week hours of exercise each time met equivalent of exercise ) and summed of all met - min / wk values for each patient evaluated .
height and body weight were measured while the subjects were in a standing position at baseline and 10 week .
25-hydroxy vitamin d was assessed by using a commercial elisa kit ( immuno diagnostic systems ) . at the beginning and the end of the study .
ast and alt serum levels were measured through enzymatic photometric method ( ifcc ) with a sensitivity of 2 u / l and a coefficient of variation of 14% ( alt , ast , and alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) were measured by commercially available enzymatic reagents ( pars azmoon

transurethral resection of the prostate ( turp ) is still viewed as the benchmark for surgical therapies for benign prostatic enlargement ( bpe ) .
even though the mortality and short - term morbidity rates following turp in contemporary series are much lesser than in the older series ( 0.1% vs. 0.2% mortality rate , 11.1% vs. 18% morbidity rate ) , they still remain an area of concern to the urologist .
the learning curve for turp , as most urologists would agree , ranges from 50 - 100 cases and this level of experience is often not reached by the end of the residency training period because of the dramatic decrease in the overall turps being performed annually .
these , among other factors have driven the search for a safer , easier to perform alternative that is as efficacious as turp for the surgical management of bpe . among the emerging surgical therapies for bpe ,
it is selectively absorbed by hemoglobin within prostatic tissue , thus permitting photoselective vaporization of prostate ( pvp ) .
ktp - pvp is considered to be easier to learn and perform than turp and competence occurs following 5 - 20 procedures . even though ktp - pvp is being done now for well over a decade , data comparing ktp - pvp with standard
we performed a prospective , randomized study to examine the efficacy and safety profile of ktp - pvp when compared to standard turp .
the study protocol and all procedures were approved by the institutional ethics committee . between february 2009 and august 2009
, consecutive patients attending the urology opd with lower urinary tract symptoms ( luts ) secondary to benign prostatic enlargement ( bpe ) who satisfied the eligibility criteria ( inclusion / exclusion criteria ) and who were planned for surgery according to the international bph guidelines of the american urology association were included in this prospective , randomized study .
inclusion criteria : a ] age > 50 years , b ] ipss>7 , c ] prostate volume ( trus ) : > 20 and  ⁇  80 cc , d ] q max  ⁇  15 ml / sec .
e ] patient presenting with an indwelling foley 's catheter where indication for catheterization was chronic retention(pvru > 300 ) .
g ] patients receiving alpha blocker/5 alpha reductase inhibitor drugs / herbal medications believed to be active in prostate .
initial evaluation included a detailed clinical history including the international prostate symptom score ( ipss ) , quality of life ( qol ) score and international index of erectile function ( iief5 ) score , physical examination including digital rectal and focused neurological examination , urinalysis , serum prostate specific antigen ( psa ) measurement , prostate volume estimation by transrectal ultrasound ( trus ) , post - void residual urine ( pvru ) measurement by abdominal ultrasound and qmax ( maximum flow rate ) measurement on uroflowmetry ( ufr ) .
 ⁇  pvru and ufr measurement were not done in patients who were on catheter consequent to acute retention of urine .
such patients were eligible if all other criteria were met with ⁇ . if the digital rectal examination was abnormal and/or
the psa was > 4 ng / ml , a 12-core trus - guided prostatic biopsy was performed preoperatively to rule out prostate cancer .
all procedures were performed by one of the three consultant urologists in our department , each of whom were skilled in turp but had performed  ⁇  5 ktp - pvp prior to this study .
all three surgeons performed nearly equal number of ktp - pvps and turps . for pvp , a continuous flow 23f laserscope was used .
the lens employed was a 30-degree lens and the irrigant used was 0.9% sodium chloride .
the fiber was a 600 micron , 70 degree side firing laser fiber emitting green light at 532 nm . at first
the median lobe ( when present ) was lased and thereafter the lateral lobes were lased in a symmetrical manner .
tissue was vaporized down to the prostatic capsule until an unobstructed view of the trigone and a turp like cavity was obtained .
vaporization was achieved by moving the laser fiber slowly and constantly in a paint brush fashion taking care to keep the fiber in near contact with the prostatic tissue . if any bleeding vessels were encountered during vaporization , coagulation was accomplished by defocusing the laser fiber ( increasing working distance to 3 - 4 mm ) or by reducing the power setting to 30w from 80w .
a standard tungsten cutting wire loop at a setting of 160 w cutting and 80 w coagulation was used .
the resection was carried down to the surgical capsule from bladder neck up to the verumontanum .

the causes are multifactorial , with extramedullary pulmonary hematopoiesis being described as a rare etiological factor ( 2 ) .
this occurs in conditions such as myeloproliferative disorders , hemoglobinopathies and marrow infiltrating diseases . in chronic myeloproliferative disorders , extramedullary hematopoiesis in the lungs
may be suspected on computed tomography ( ct ) chest scans in the presence of diffuse ground - glass opacities or interstitial thickening ( 3 ) .
we report the case of a 66-year - old man in whom chest ct scan did not reveal any lung parenchymal abnormality .
a pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis causing pulmonary hypertension and severe tricuspid regurgitation was diagnosed on technetium-99 m ( tc-99 m ) sulfur colloid bone marrow scan and single - photon emission computed tomography ( spect)/ct .
a 66-year - old man with a known primary myelofibrosis ( diagnosed in december 2008 at an outside institution ) presented to our hospital with complaints of shortness of breath and abdominal bloating in march 2012 .
he had multiple hospital admissions for the worsening of its dyspnea over the previous two years . on clinical examination , he was dyspneic with an elevated jugular venous pressure and bipedal pitting edema .
the total white cell count was markedly raised ( 41.2 10/l ) with a low hemoglobin level ( 5.3 g / dl ) .
a ct pulmonary angiogram did not show any pulmonary embolism ; however , the right atrium and the main pulmonary arteries were dilated , suggesting a pulmonary hypertension with reflux of contrast into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins ( fig .
1e ) . the two - dimensional echocardiography confirmed a severe tricuspid regurgitation with marked right atrial dilatation and moderately impaired right - ventricular systolic function .
a tc-99 m sulfur colloid bone marrow scan with spect / ct imaging was performed ( symbia , siemens medical solutions , erlangen , germany ) with a background history of primary myelofibrosis to exclude pulmonary hematopoiesis as the cause of pulmonary hypertension .
the planar gamma imaging showed a hepatosplenomegaly with increased tracer accumulation in the spleen , compatible with an increased hematopoietic activity resulting from an underlying myelofibrosis ( fig .
a moderate degree of tracer activity in a diffuse pattern was noted in both thoracic regions ( fig .
the spect / ct imaging confirmed the location of an increased thoracic tracer activity in the lungs ( fig .
a lung biopsy was not carried out in view of the increased risk of pulmonary hemorrhage in the presence of pulmonary hypertension .
a hydroxyurea treatment was started for the patient to control the markedly raised total leukocyte count and massive splenomegaly .
concurrently , he was referred to a short course radiation - therapy to the lungs with view to achieve control of the pulmonary hematopoiesis .
the usual sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis are the liver , spleen and intrathoracic paraspinal regions ( 3 ) .
lungs and pleura are rare sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis with less than forty cases of pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis described in the current literature ( 4 ) . a causal association between pulmonary hematopoiesis leading to dyspnea and
pulmonary hypertension has been postulated in few case reports and a limited number of cohort studies ( 1 , 2 , 5 ) .
( 1 ) listed hematopoietic infiltration of the pulmonary parenchyma as one of the probable causes of pulmonary hypertension in patients with myelofibrosis .
( 6 ) described the case of a 49-year - old man in whom dyspnea due to pulmonary hematopoiesis was a presenting feature of myelofibrosis . in most of
case reports describing pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis , the diagnosis was suspected on the chest ct scan due to abnormalities such as ground - glass opacities ( 4 ) or interstitial septal thickening ( 6 ) .
ground - glass opacities per se are non - specific ct findings with more common differentials of congestive cardiac failure and lung infection in patients presenting with dyspnea . in the setting of myelofibrosis ,
additional possibilities include pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis , thromboembolism or chemotherapy - induced lung toxicity ( 7 ) . in our case ,
an increased lung uptake of tc-99 m sulfur colloid is not specific to an extramedullary pulmonary hematopoiesis .

human cells show a different ddr during mitosis than in other cell cycle phases . during most of the cell cycle ,
after cells reach the point of no return , however , dsbs on mitotic chromosomes do not trigger cell - cycle delay or arrest ; and the cells rather proceed through mitosis even if they contain unrepaired dsbs or fragmented chromosomes.(32 ) indeed , the sensitivity to ionizing radiation is higher in mitotic cells than in interphase cells.(33,34 ) moreover , dsb introduction into mitotic cells by etoposide treatment induces massive chromosome aberrations in the next cell cycle in a cancer cell line ( fig .
thus , dsbs during mitosis are very toxic to cells because of the induction of severe genomic instability .
effect of etoposide - induced double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) during mitosis on genomic instability of mitotic chromosomes .
representative images of chromosome spreads from etoposide - treated ( + etoposide ) and non - treated ( etoposide ) in hct116 human colon cancer cells arrested in mitosis .
during mitosis , dsbs activate pikks to induce phosphorylation of h2ax , and mdc1 as well as the mrn complex are recruited to the dsb sites , as seen during interphases ( fig .
however , the recruitment of rnf8 , rnf168 , 53bp1 , and brca1 to dsb is largely suppressed during mitosis ( fig .
1b , d , right).(30,33 ) the mechanism of the suppression and its purpose were not well understood .
two groups recently showed that localization of rnf8 and 53bp1 to dsbs is inhibited during mitosis.(35,36 ) the first work done by orthwein et al .
( 2014 ) showed that , in human cells , rnf8 and 53bp1 are phosphorylated during mitosis by cdk1 and that inhibition of the phosphorylation restores their localization to dsb sites ( fig .
orthwein et al . also identified t198 on rnf8 as a cdk1 phosphorylation site and showed that rnf8-t198a , a phosphorylation - defective protein , can localize to mitotic chromatin after dsb introduction .
rnf8 prepared from mitotic extracts can not bind to mdc1 in vitro , but rnf8 prepared from cdk1 activity - inhibited cells interacts with mdc1 in vitro .
they also found that t1609 and s1618 on 53bp1 are phosphorylated during mitosis ( fig .
3a ) and that 53bp1-t1609a / s1618a double mutant protein can localize to mitotic chromatin and restores dsb repair in cells expressing rnf8-t198a .
their study confirmed that t1609 is phosphorylated by cdk1 , whereas s1618 is a target of plk1 in vitro .
these show that there are at least two distinct mechanisms to regulate the recruitment of these ddr effector proteins.(35 ) domain structure of 53bp1 and comparison of cdk1 and plk1 sites among xrcc4 orthologs .
( b ) domain structure of xrcc4 and conservation of phosphorylation sites among various species .
s326 in the c - terminus of human xrcc4 ( hs ) is a potential cdk1 phosphorylation site .
the gray and black boxes show xlf and dna ligase iv binding sites , respectively .
phosphorylation of cdk1 or plk1 sites are shown in mouse ( ms ) , chicken ( gg ) , zebrafish ( de ) , and budding yeast ( sc ) .
dna ligase iv and xlf binding sites in mouse , chicken , and zebrafish were predicted by aligning with the dna ligase iv and xlf binding sites of human xrcc4 using t - coffee software .
( 2014 ) indicated that t1609 and s1618 of 53bp1 are hyperphosphorylated in the absence of pp4c phosphatase in human cell lines.(36,37 ) they analyzed the function of pp4c phosphatase during ddr and found that these sites are phosphorylated specifically during mitosis.(36 ) these mitosis - specific phosphorylation sites are located in the ubiquitin - dependent recruitment motif of 53bp1 , a recognition site of ubiquitinated h2a , which is required for the localization of the protein to dsb sites.(1517 ) both of the reports(35

oral melanoma is an extremely rare tumor arising from uncontrolled growth of melanocytes found in the basal layer of oral mucous membrane .
it occurs between 30 and 90 years of age , with a higher incidence in the 6th decade with a mean age of 56 years .
it is having a higher prevalence in yellows , blacks , japanese , and indians of asia due to more frequent finding of melanin pigmentation in oral mucosa of these races .
green et al . described criteria for diagnosis of primary oral melanoma which includes demonstration of melanoma in the oral mucosa , presence of junctional activity , inability to demonstrate extraoral primary melanoma .
a total of 80% to 90% of oral malignant melanoma arises in the mucosa of maxillary jaw with a majority occurring on the keratinized mucosa of hard palate and gingiva .
clinically , it is easy to diagnose them as these are pigmented ones and have irregular shape and outline .
these are mostly asymptomatic and detected only when there is ulceration or hemorrhage of the overlying epithelium
. the delayed detection may be the cause for the poor prognosis with a 5-year survival being between 15% and 38% .
the purpose of this article is to present a case of oral malignant melanoma , as well as to emphasize the necessity for early recognition and treatment of this lesion .
a 48-year - old male patient reported to the department of oral medicine and diagnosis with chief complaint of pain and swelling in the upper right gums .
the clinical examination revealed a large mass of 8 3 cm in dimension on buccal aspect of right maxillary alveolus involving marginal , attached , and interdental gingiva [ figure 1 ] .
anteriorly , it extends from the gingiva of mesial surface of 22 , to the gingiva in relation to 17 posteriorly .
13 was missing and 12 was displaced laterally ; while , 11 , 12 , and 21 exhibited mobility . primary oral malignant melanoma extending from 22 to distal aspect of 17 the palpatory findings revealed a firm consistency of lesion with mild pain .
a complete examination of the lesion was done and no other primary site of the lesion was found .
correlating all clinical features , diagnosis of primary malignant melanoma of oral cavity was made and the patient was referred for further investigations .
a computed tomography examination of neck , chest , abdomen , and bone scanning and ultrasounds of liver and kidney were normal excluding any diagnosis of distant metastasis .
an incisional biopsy was done for the lesion under local anesthesia and the specimen was sent for histopathologic examination .
the gross examination of tissue revealed a mass of 2 mm 3 mm 1 mm in size , which was black in color and firm in consistency .
the hematoxylin and eosin - stained section showed a melanin - producing tumor , consisting of atypical irregularly elongated spindle and oval - shaped melanocytes , exhibiting uniformly dark , enlarged and irregular nuclei [ figure 2 ] . in the superficial layers of the tissue , a junctional nevus with pigmentation
the diagnosis of an invasive melanoma arising most likely from a pre - existing junctional nevus was made and the patient was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic for required therapy . as per the traditional approach , partial maxillectomy of the right side was performed . to reduce the defect and to reconstruct alveolus ,
microvascular fibula flap was used . the orbital floor near to maxilla was reconstructed with the help of premolded titanium mesh .
the histologic examination of the specimen confirmed the initial diagnosis of an invasive melanoma of the oral mucosa .
the patient has been followed - up with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis either clinically or radiographically , 11 months after the tumor 's resection .
the hematoxylin and eosin stained section shows melanoma with invasive pattern showing large cells with pleomorphic vesicular nucleus and brown pigment ( 40 ) the hematoxylin and eosin stained section shows stratified squamous keratinized epithelium with in situmelanotic pigment growth ( 10 )
it has no known predisposing factors and is difficult to diagnose and manage . differentiating it from a metastatic melanoma is often challenging .
the first symptoms of oral melanoma described by berthelsen were those of asymptomatic swelling and occasional bleeding , where he found that only 2 ( 14% ) patients had a pain .
because most of the melanomas are painless in their early stages , the diagnosis is often unfortunately delayed until symptoms resulting from ulceration , growth , or bleeding are noted .
the pain may be the later manifestation in melanoma as in our case that again could cause delay in seeking treatment . on gross appearance ,
the tumors on the palate are usually flat , with a varying degree of thickness .

the retina is susceptible to a variety of degenerative diseases , including age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) , retinitis pigmentosa ( rp ) and other inherited photoreceptor degenerations , photoreceptor loss following retinal detachment , ganglion cell loss in glaucoma and optic neuropathies , as well as the loss of retinal neurons associated with nondegenerative conditions such as diabetic retinopathy ( dr ) , macular edema and ischemia , vascular occlusions , trauma , and inflammatory diseases .
amd is a particularly prevalent cause of blindness among elderly persons , affecting more than 30 million people globally .
that number is expected to double over the next decade in association with demographic shifts towards an older population , particularly in developed countries .
similar to the situation with many neurological diseases , little is available in the way of effective treatments for patients with amd or other blinding disorders of the retina .
a large body of research has shown that the use of exogenous neurotrophic factors can reproducibly promote the survival of specific neurons in various parts of the central nervous system ( cns ) , including the retina [ 2 , 3 ] .
frequently investigated neuroprotective neurotrophic factors have included glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( gdnf ) , brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) , and ciliary neurotrophic factor ( cntf ) . among these
, gdnf has been associated with significant effects with respect to preventing cell death , including the protection of specific neuronal populations in the brain [ 5 , 6 ] , spinal cord , and retina [ 811 ] .
receptors for gdnf are known to be expressed within the mature retina [ 8 , 11 , 12 ] .
stem and progenitor cell transplantation has also shown considerable promise in animal models of neural degeneration .
subretinal transplantation of neural progenitor cells ( npcs ) has yielded intriguing evidence of cellular repopulation of damaged retinas , growth of neurites into the optic nerve head and retardation of ongoing retinal degeneration [ 1317 ] .
both unmodified , as well as genetically modified , cortical human npcs can survive for prolonged periods , migrate extensively , secrete growth factors , and rescue visual function following subretinal transplantation in the dystrophic royal college of surgeons rat , with sustained visual benefits following injection . more recently
, subretinal transplantation of human forebrain progenitor cells has been extended to nonhuman primates , although this model used nondystrophic hosts and therefore did not lend itself to evaluation of neuroprotective efficacy . when used for transplantation therapy , npcs engineered to secrete gdnf contributed to reduced apoptotic death in vitro , enhanced survival in vivo , neuronal differentiation , and improved host cognitive function following traumatic brain injury as compared with nontransduced npcs [ 2124 ] . 
the visual system of the cat is quite sophisticated and one of the most extensively studied among higher mammals .
there are many similarities to the human retina although that of the cat has a tapetum and is generally optimized for performance under scotopic conditions . like humans ,
the cat retina has also been the subject of decades of anatomical and physiological studies and has been used as an animal model of binocular visual function as well as studies involving drug treatment and research on retina detachment [ 27 , 28 ] .
in addition , the feline eye is large relative to that of rodents thereby allowing the application of surgical techniques similar to those typically used clinically .
finally , there exist feline models of retinal degeneration caused by spontaneous mutations in genes known to be involved in retinitis pigmentosa in humans [ 29 , 30 ] .
these animals provide excellent models for exploring the therapeutic potential of stem cell - based neuroprotective strategies in an animal with highly developed visual capabilities . 
previously , we showed that it is possible to derive npcs from the developing cat brain and that these cells are capable of integration into the retina of dystrophic feline recipients .
to more fully exploit the potential of this model , it is useful to develop feline npcs capable of sustained growth factor delivery to the host retina .
here we use a bicistronic feline lentiviral vector to generate genetically modified feline neural progenitor cells that exhibit sustained overexpression of gdnf before and after differentiation .
cat neural progenitor cells ( cnpcs ) were originally isolated from 47 day cat fetuses as previously described .
briefly , forebrains were removed and finely minced with a surgical scalpel and the resulting tissue fragments digested for 20 minutes in 0.1% type i collagenase ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) .
the supernatant containing dissociated cells was then passed through a 100 mm mesh strainer , centrifuged , and seeded

a 71-year old caucasian male with dilative cardiomiopathy and irrelevant family history was admitted to our hospital for the evaluation of a suspected liver disease .
laboratory findings revealed a slight anemia ( hemoglobin level of 12,5 g / dl , hematocrit of 38% , red blood cells count of 3,9 mil / mm ) .
iu / l ) and elevated gammagluta - myltranspeptidase ( ggt=230 iu / l ) .
ultrasound showed multiple small hypo- and hyperechoic lesion foci , some cystic lesions with comet - tail echoes , the biggest cyst measured 8 mm in the vii segment ( fig .
ct scan revealed multiple small cystic lesions ; the largest hypodense nodule was in the vii hepatic segment with no peripheral or central enhancement ( fig .
multiple small cystic lesions were detected with t1 hyposignal and t2 hypersignal , the largest being in segment vii ( fig .
corroborating data from these imaging techniques with 6 month follow up , the final diagnosis was biliary hamartoma ( complex von meyenburg ) .
biliary hamartoma is a benign congenital malformation of the biliary duct which was described for the first time in 1918 by von mayenburg , therefore it is also called von mayenburg complex ( vmcs ) .
although jaundice and portal hypertension may arise as a result of mass effect , patients are usually asymptomatic
. the biliary hamartomas may be single or multiple , with size ranging between 1 and 15 mm . due to the small size of the lesions ,
histologically , it consists of disorganized and dilated bile ducts and ductules surrounded by fibrous stroma .
the multiple comet - tail sign is thought to be the specific us finding of vmcs ( 6 ) .
it has been suggested that lesional echogenicity may depends on the number and size of the dilated bile ducts and on the degree of fibrosis .
on contrast enhanced ct , biliary hamartomas are usualy of low attenuation and may have irregular margins .
the majority of cases reported suggest that vmc does not show contrast enhancement . on mri ,
vmcs are described as hypointense on t1 and hyperintense on t2 in comparison with surrounding liver parenchyma . although biliary hamartoma is a benign condition , there are some isolated reports of hepatic malignancies on a background of vmc , including hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma .
biliary hamartomas usually presents as multiple small nodules and despite the fact that they are rare , they may be confused with liver metastatic disease , microabscesses , diffuse primary hepatocellular carcinoma , biliary cysts or caroli s disease . in conclusion , associating different imaging modalities with the follow - up are very useful in the diagnosis of biliary hamartoma .
a correct diagnosis is established when typical imaging findings are present , otherwise histological confirmation might be needed .

people whose rights are not respected on the basis of their gender identity or sexual orientation lack protection within families and the community at large .
this places a constraint on their ability to seek health services and information . at the same time , for economic reasons or due to low self - esteem , they may engage in risky behavior which can predispose them to infection with human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) and hepatitis virus .
the lack of opportunities for people experiencing social exclusion pushes them toward financial poverty , worsens their physical and mental health status , and perpetuates this vicious cycle.1 according to research conducted by anthropologists , pockets of areas existed in africa before the colonial era where homosexuality was practiced .
it was not openly acknowledged because issues related to sexuality were taboo and not intended for public discussion.2 open acknowledgment of same sex relationships is perceived as a threat to the traditional african culture and religion because it contradicts their definition of what constitutes family and community .
it is also perceived to be the negative influence of westernization ( globalization ) and should therefore be repressed or curtailed .
several actions are undertaken to achieve this , including bullying , taunting , hostility , discrimination , and violence.3 stigma , discrimination , and human rights violation has trailed the hiv epidemic and had posed a significant challenge hampering efforts geared toward prevention , care , and support . from the report of a survey conducted between 2008 and 2011,4 a high proportion of men and women living with hiv in nigeria reported verbal and physical abuse , experiencing stigma within the family and community , as well as loss of job or income.5
achieving universal access will remain a dream if people most at risk , infected , or affected can not access information and services .
this can be as a result of punitive laws , economic circumstances , religious beliefs , sociocultural prejudices , and norms that pose structural barriers.4 human rights violations , including extrajudicial killings , torture , detention , and even rape , have been perpetuated against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity . to protect the human rights of individuals with respect to this issue , a set of guidelines , ie
, the yogyakarta principles , were developed to guide the application of international human rights.6 as of may 2013 , most of the un member countries were not conforming to the yogyakarta principles ; 65 countries and 85 entities have anti - discriminatory laws compared with the 31 countries and 35 entities that recognize same sex unions .
same sex activities and relationships in the northern sharia - implementing states of nigeria , somalia , and another five countries in the world attract the death penalty . in 71 countries and five entities ,
the punishment is imprisonment.1,7 according to chapter 21 articles 214 and 217 of the country s criminal code , same - sex sexual activity is a felony in nigeria , and punishable by imprisonment of up to 14 years.1,6,7 greater experiences of family rejection , a traumatic form of emotional abuse as a result of gender identity and sexual orientation , has been linked with poor mental health outcomes ( attempted suicide , high levels of depression , and substance use problems among adolescents).8 one of the recognized coping mechanisms seen upon exposure to a stressful environment is alcohol and drug use aimed at numbing the pain experienced .
this can lead to alcohol dependency and drug abuse , creating a situation whereby men will engage in risky sexual behavior .
globally , the number of new hiv infections and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids)-related deaths has been dropping over the years . an estimated 20% reduction in the number of people newly infected with hiv and 24% fewer deaths from the disease was observed between 2001 and 2011.5 in nigeria , available reports indicate an increase in the number of people newly infected with hiv from an estimated 250,000 in 2005 to over 388,000 in 2012 .
men who have sex with men ( msm ) and their partners , according to the report , were responsible for 10% of all new infections that occurred in the country within that time period.9 globally , the prevalence of hiv has been observed to be higher among msm than in the general population in most countries.5 in nigeria , 17.2% of msm were living with hiv in 2010 compared with the national prevalence of 4.1%.10 this study examined the occurrence of human rights violations among msm living in lagos in 2012 before the same sex marriage prohibition bill was signed into law by the president of the federal republic of nigeria .
the study site was lagos , a densely populated cosmopolitan city in south western nigeria .
a list of community centers frequented by msm in lagos state was collected from the lagos state aids control agency .

korea became an aging society in 2000 , and in 2008 , the prevalence of individuals aged 65 years or older was 10.3 % . in 2018 , korea will become an aged society when 14.4 % of its population comprise the elderly , and a super - aged society by 2026 [ 1 , 2 ] .
to overcome this situation , the korean government introduced a new social insurance scheme for long - term care ( ltc ) in july 2008 .
the ltc insurance program provides social services for elderly people with a few functional limitations .
the purpose of this insurance system was to meet the markedly increased demand for elderly healthcare as a result of a rapidly aging population , elevated expectations for healthcare , and a change in the pattern of medical conditions in the elderly from acute illness to chronic disability .
this insurance uses the ltc grade for denoting how much help is required for an elderly person in their daily lives .
after the implementation of ltc insurance , the number of nursing facilities in korea also increased sharply from 1717 locations ( 68,581 people ) in 2008 to 3751 locations ( 116,782 people ) .
researchers have documented the widespread incidence of inappropriate medication use in elderly persons and reported an estimated prevalence from 4.8 to 45.6 % [ 511 ] .
the proper use of medicines and monitoring for adverse effects are important factors in the treatment of elderly patients .
aging is associated with a reduction in first - pass metabolism and therefore an increase in the bioavailability and distribution of drugs , which increases the risk of adverse effects ; these risks grow exponentially when a number of different drugs are used .
because of the potentially serious consequences of exaggerated or incorrect prescriptions , screening tools have been created to detect inadequacies in drug prescriptions . in 2012 , the american geriatrics society ( ags ) and an interdisciplinary panel of experts in geriatric care and pharmacotherapy reached a consensus on the 2012 ags beers criteria .
fifty - three medications or medication classes encompass the final updated criteria , which are divided into three categories : potentially inappropriate medications ( pims ) or classes to avoid in older adults ; pims or classes to avoid in older adults with certain diseases and syndromes that the listed drugs can exacerbate ; and medications to be used with caution in older adults .
elderly nursing home residents regularly receive complex multi - drug therapy because of the presence of both acute and chronic diseases . for this reason ,
there have been few reports dealing with the prevalence of pim prescriptions or their adverse effects on elderly patients in south korea [ 14 , 15 ] . to our knowledge
, there have been no reports on the prevalence of pim prescriptions in south korea ltc facilities using the 2012 version of the beers criteria .
hence , we evaluate the frequency of inappropriate medication use in elderly patients admitted to nursing homes in korea by applying the newly revised 2012 ags beers criteria .
a retrospective cross - sectional survey study was performed in patients aged 65 years or older , which produced a sample of 824 people admitted to 20 nursing facilities in northwest korea from january 2012 to february 2012 .
we excluded four patients who did not take any medications , 259 patients with incomplete medical records , and 32 patients who were not included in any ltci programs .
we assessed the patients age , sex , co - medication , comorbidity , activities of daily living ( adl ) , length of stay , grade of ltc insurance for seniors , and the bed size and business type of the ltc care facilities .
the ltc grade is based on standards of five areas of physical functions ( adl ) , cognition , behavioral changes ( behavioral problems ) , demand on nursing care , and need for rehabilitation , and judgment standards made in consideration of service necessary according to the state of functions . on a checklist with a maximum score of 100 , a score of 55 and over makes an individual eligible for insured care .
categories of ltc grade are defined as follows : grade 1 ( most severe)the elderly person has one of the following handicaps : he or she can not go to or get out of bed unaided ; experiences behavioral difficulties , impaired judgment , and frequent memory loss as a result of severe brain injury ; or completely needs full assistance with all the activities of daily life and records a ltc acknowledgment score of at least 95 ; grade 2 ( severe)the elderly person can not eat , defecate nor dress themselves unaided ; has impaired judgment and memory loss due to dementia ; needs considerable help in moving or moving in a wheelchair ; spends most parts of daily life in bed and records an ltc acknowledgment score of at least 75 but less than 95 ; grade 3 ( moderate)the elderly person partially needs considerable ltc protection ; some degree of

extrahepatic portal venous obstruction ( ehpvo ) is accompanied by replacement of the extrahepatic portal vein by a cavernoma with or without thrombosis of the intrahepatic portal , splenic , or superior mesenteric veins . in developing countries ,
ehpvo has been reported to be the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( ugib ) in children ( 70% in some reports ) and is also a common cause of variceal bleeding in adults . in western countries , ehpvo is second only to cirrhosis as a cause of portal hypertension , but its relative incidence is much lower compared with that in the developing countries .
its aetiology is still not clear but has been attributed to umbilical sepsis after birth with thrombosis extending to the portal system via the patent umbilical vein or portal pyaemia following intra - abdominal sepsis .
however , notwithstanding a lack of knowledge about its cause , most children and adults with ehpvo are generally from the so - called lower economic strata .
however , the outcome after a bleed is better compared to bleeding in cirrhotics ( if adequate blood replacement facilities are at hand ) , because patients with ehpvo have normal liver function ( and histology ) which helps them to sustain bleeding episodes without decompensation
. however mortality rates of between 5 and 30% have been reported for a single bleeding episode because of the large volumes of blood lost in patients who do not have access to sophisticated medical facilities including blood transfusion . till the middle of the 20th century , surgery was the only treatment available for these patients . however , with the advent of endoscopic therapy , this soon became the predominant treatment modality for the control of acute bleeding and also an important method for the prevention of a repeated bleeding episode .
the main disadvantages of endotherapy are that it requires multiple sessions and a long - term followup with a recurrence rate of up to 40% in some studies .
because the prevalence of ehpvo is the highest in developing countries and the condition affects mainly the poor [ 2 , 19 ] , most of whom do not have access to blood transfusion facilities and are not treatment compliant , the benefits of using a less invasive procedure like endoscopic therapy must be weighed against surgery which , in the best centres carries an operative mortality of 1% , is a onetime treatment , is not associated with encephalopathy and followed by rebleeding rates of less than 10% .
moreover , operations like a splenectomy and proximal lienorenal shunt eliminate a large painful spleen and hypersplenism and restore a normal growth pattern in children .
thus , any new treatment for ehpvo must be compared with the results of shunt surgery which have stood the test of time especially if it has been performed by an experienced surgeon .
a history of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a child who has oesophagogastric varices in endoscopy and normal liver function tests should raise the suspicion of extrahepatic portal venous obstruction .
although a similar picture can also be present in well compensated child a , cirrhosis ehpvo is much more common in children especially in the developing world .
investigations to confirm the diagnosis are usually simple and readily available at most centres . 
massive splenomegaly is present in 90% of patients , and a complete blood count may reveal a low haemoglobin level and decreased total leukocyte and platelet counts due to hypersplenism in 50% .
liver function tests are nearly always normal , unlike in cirrhotics , but in the long - term the prothrombin time and albumin levels may be deranged due to the prolonged decreased portal blood flow and hence decreased synthetic function . 

ultrasonic doppler ( usg doppler ) examination of the upper abdomen should be the first radiological investigation performed to confirm the diagnosis as it has a sensitivity of 7090% and a specificity of 99% in diagnosing ehpvo .
the characteristic findings are the replacement of portal vein by multiple tortuous vessels , also known as cavernous transformation , with hepatopetal blood flow in the collaterals ( figure 1 ) .
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy ( ugie ) is done to confirm the presence of varices and to grade their size .
splenoportovenography by splenic puncture or selective coeliac / superior mesenteric angiography provides excellent imaging of the portal venous system but is invasive and has largely been replaced with computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography . 
ct arterial portography is highly accurate , not operator dependent , and useful in circumstances when bowel gas obscures the findings on ultrasound examination . however , its high cost , exposure to radiation , and the systemic toxicity of the contrast agents used are its main disadvantages ( figure 2 ) .
mr angiography is noninvasive and has a diagnostic accuracy that is similar to ct

a 56-year - old gentleman previously known to have rheumatic mitral stenosis , presented with a recent increase of dyspnea ( new york heart association class iii ) , now associated with orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea . on examination , he had rapid atrial fibrillation with a pulse rate of 130/min .
after control of the pulse rate with digoxin and beta blockers , echocardiography revealed a mitral valve area of 1.1 cm by pressure half - time method , a mean diastolic pressure gradient of 18 mm hg across the mitral valve , a total mitral valve score of 9/16 , and no mitral regurgitation .
moderate calcification of the mitral valve was noted ; however , since no commissural calcium was found , percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty was planned .
trans - esophageal echocardiography showed no thrombi in the left atrial appendage , a mitral valve annulus diameter of 38 mm , and a thin inter - atrial septum ( 2 mm ) .
the procedure was performed through a right femoral vein puncture , employing the multi - track technique , using 2 balloons ( 20 and 18 mm in diameter ) . following a smooth trans - septal puncture ,
the mitral valve was crossed with a judkins right catheter , and 2 wires were secured in the left ventricular apex with a double coil clearly seen in both .
the 2 balloons were advanced along the wires and inflated ; yet , surprisingly , no clear waist was seen ( figure 1 ) .
skeptic about the balloon position , the operator decided to redo the inflation more proximally , wherein a clear waist was seen that ultimately yielded to balloon inflation .
suddenly , blood pressure collapsed to 80/60 mm hg , with a slow though still irregular 
bedside echocardiography confirmed the presence of moderate pericardial effusion so that pericardiocentesis was immediately performed ( figure 2 ) .
roughly , 250 ml of frank red oxygenated blood were drained out of the pericardial sac . in the mean time , heparin was counteracted by protamine sulphate administration , and dopamine infusion started at a rate of 10 g / kg / min .
blood pressure returned back to 100/60 mm hg , and the pulse rate rose to 100 bpm .
the pigtail catheter in the pericardial sac stopped to drain any more blood ; however , once again , blood pressure started to drop progressively down to 60/40 mm hg , and the pulse rate surged now to 110 bpm .
amazingly , bedside echocardiography unveiled an echo - dense mass posterior to the left ventricle .
unfortunately , however , during transfer to the operating room , the patient was arrested in asystole .
resuscitation started straight away and continued for 15 min , well inside the operating room .
following median thoracotomy , the surgeon was confronted with a large blood clot filling the posterior pericardial sac .
the clot was removed at once ; the heart restarted to beat at 70 bpm and blood pressure was restored to 100/70 mm hg .
a 1.5 cm tear was discovered in the left ventricular apex , which was sutured with teflon sutures . eventually , the patient was hemodynamically stable but was discharged to the intensive care unit in deep coma , wherein he was supported with mechanical ventilation .
his consciousness level improved the next day , so that his glasgow coma score was 6 ; the day after , it reached 9 .
thereafter , he became fully conscious , and was disconnected off mechanical ventilation ; however , he suffered some memory deficit , and mild motor dysphasia .
three days later , he regained an almost normal neurological state and was discharged from the intensive care unit .
post - procedural echocardiography revealed a mitral valve area of 1.9 cm , with no mitral regurgitation , and confirmed the absence of further accumulation in the pericardium .
over the past two decades , percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty has emerged as the procedure of choice in 
the procedure is associated with mortality rates that range from 0 to 3% , chiefly due to cardiac tamponade , severe mitral regurgitation , or deterioration of the patient 's general condition . 
 
the incidence of hemopericardium following percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty is reported at 1 - 3% , being related to either trans - septal puncture or left ventricular perforation with guide wires or balloons . 
 
the site of perforation is crucial for both the immediate and long - term outcome .
frequently self - limited perforation of the right atrial appendage often responds well to pericardiocentesis , and spontaneous closure is the rule . on the other hand ,

the metabolic syndrome ( mes ) is defined as a cluster of interrelated metabolic abnormalities that doubles the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) .
the major features of mes are insulin resistance , central obesity , hypertension , and dyslipidaemia .
this condition is often associated with suppression of adiponectin and elevation of leptin and various inflammatory markers ( e.g. , interleukin-6 [ il-6 ] , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [ mcp-1 ] , c - reactive protein [ crp ] , and regulated on activation , normal t cell expressed and secreted [ rantes ] ) [ 2 , 3 ] that may play a causal role in insulin resistance .
also , insufficient physical activity accompanied with increased or inappropriate fat accumulation [ 4 , 5 ] may potentially increase the risk of cvd .
the prevalence of mes in gulf cooperation council ( gcc ) countries is ranked amongst the highest in the world .
furthermore , the risk of mes is higher amongst arab women ( 1355% ) compared to arab men ; it is 18% higher in women in oman [ 8 , 9 ] , 55% in qatar , 22% in united arab emirates , and 13% in saudi arabia . on the other hand , data from caucasian populations either point to men and women being equally at risk of developing mes [ 1315 ] or to men being more predisposed to developing mes than women [ 1621 ]
this difference in mes risk is thought to be , at least partly , explained by men having a greater propensity for abdominal obesity compared to premenopausal women .
it is unclear as to what factors confer the reported higher risk of developing mes in arab women compared to men .
gender differences in fat accumulation and/or the secretory function of adipose tissue may explain some of this disparity .
poor aerobic fitness , in addition to low grade inflammation , contributes to the development of insulin resistance and is often a better predictor for cvd risk factors than self - reported physical activity .
furthermore , muscular strength and aerobic fitness combined or independently are inversely related to mes .
therefore , this study investigated gender differences in body composition , systemic levels of adipokines and inflammatory markers , and aerobic fitness in a cohort of healthy qatari adults matched for age and body mass index ( bmi ) .
a matched case - control study was conducted at aspetar , qatar orthopaedic and sports medicine hospital between february 2009 and december 2009 .
this study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee and all subjects provided written consent prior to participation .
healthy qatari men ( n = 29 ) and women ( n = 29 ) were matched for age and bmi .
subjects with diabetes mellitus , those who were pregnant or postmenopausal , or receiving medical treatment for any chronic disease were excluded from the study .
after a 10-hour overnight fast , subjects underwent a detailed clinical assessment , including body composition , fat distribution , anthropometry measurements , and blood pressure .
subjects also underwent a series of tests for aerobic fitness and indices of muscular strength .
height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm ( seca 242 , germany ) , and weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a portable stadiometer ( detecto , usa ) . both height and weight measurements
waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the smallest girth horizontally around the trunk underneath the subject 's clothing .
central obesity was defined as > 80 cm for women and > 90 cm for men .
two blood pressure readings were taken 5 minutes apart with the subject at rest in a relaxed sitting position . the average systolic and diastolic blood pressures were calculated and used in subsequent analyses .
dxa ( ge medical system lunar , madison , wisconsin , usa ) using the encore software ( version 12.10 ) was used to quantify fat mass ( g ) , tissue ( g ) , lean mass ( g ) and percentage of body fat .
ct scans were performed to obtain 5 axial images of each of the following regions : heart , liver , abdomen , and midthigh . for the abdominal region ,
omental adipose tissue was differentiated from subcutaneous adipose tissue by manual drawing , and subcutaneous adipose tissue was further classified as superficial and deep .

prescription writing is a complex and challenging task that requires diagnostic skills , knowledge of medicines , communication skills , an understanding of the principles of clinical pharmacology , and appreciation of risk . in recent years ,
medical researchers observe deficiencies in health care occurring due to many prescribing errors , which arise because of two factors .
one could be due to decision making and the other due to defect in the art of writing prescriptions .
the factors related to the former could be inappropriate prescription , irrational prescription , under prescribing , or over prescribing .
the illegibility of the prescription or omission of any of the details in a prescription order could result in misinterpretation and medication errors .
a good prescription should be legible and possess all the essential information necessary for the pharmacist to dispense and the patient to follow in such a way to avoid possible errors and thereby the complications introduced by such defaults . although prescription writing is a part of the medical students ' curriculum , their prescribing skills are still poor either as a part of their examinations or as they go out as qualified health professionals .
although many prescribing errors are unintentional , studies have shown that the prescribing performance of interns and medical students are poor partly because of inadequate training .
furthermore , studies reveal that many medical graduates feel under - prepared to take on prescribing responsibilities after graduation even though prescription writing is taught by lectures or case - based teaching .
educational interventions such as problem - based tutorials , interactive electronic tutorials , teaching sessions based on who prescribing guide , case scenario - based methods , etc . , have been tried by researchers to improve the skill . however , most of the trials failed to provide a definitive answer and a strong evidence to support the use of above interventions .
patient - based teaching is one of the educational interventions to teach clinical skills using real patients .
this offers lifelike preparation and has more relevance to the trainee s future , i.e. , their day - to - day performance as a doctor .
this intervention may improve prescribing skills since the learning occurs within the context of real patients and is easier to recall .
based on the above facts , this study was conducted to determine the role of educational intervention ( patient - based teaching ) to improve the prescribing skill of ii year medical students .
this prospective comparative study was done in a tertiary care medical college after obtaining permission from the institutional ethics committee .
as this is a pilot study in its aspect to test a newer intervention , we decided to select a small sample size .
two groups of 25 students were selected randomly from ii mbbs to participate in this study .
the control group included all the 25 students who were posted to surgery postings and the test group included whole of the 25 students who were posted in general medicine department .
written informed consent was obtained from the participants and permission obtained from the heads of the concerned departments . both groups of students ( n = 50 )
participating in the study were given general introduction about prescription writing , prescribing format and the who guidelines for selecting the preferred drug after making clinical diagnosis .
five common clinical conditions were chosen for teaching prescription writing to both the groups ( peptic ulcer , bronchial asthma , new case of hypertension and diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism ) .
the participants of the test group were subjected to patient - based teaching which was carried out in the general medicine department of our hospital exposing the students of test group to real patients suffering from the above mentioned clinical conditions .
after briefing about clinical conditions and appropriate prescriptions , students were given 10 min duration to interact with patients .
students of control group were trained on prescription writing by explaining five clinical conditions using case scenarios in the department of pharmacology . after allowing the participants of both the groups to undergo self - study for 2 days
, they were asked to write prescriptions in the standard format for the same five clinical conditions discussed .
then , assessment of their prescribing skill was done by analyzing scores obtained [ figure 1 ] . to prevent teaching and evaluation biases , teaching for both
the groups were done by the first author , evaluation by the second author and providing dummy numbers to prescriptions of the students of both the groups .
scoring for the prescriptions written by all the participants was done by a modified 14-point scoring format .
the mean scores obtained by both the groups for the five prescriptions were analyzed using unpaired t - test and the individual parameters in the 14-point score were compared by chi - square test .
an open - ended feedback was obtained from the test group students who were exposed to the newer educational intervention [ figure 1 ] .
the five prescriptions written by each student were scored and the average obtained for each student and the mean score calculated for both the study groups .

mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from all culture - positive tb patients in seattle and king county , washington , during 20032004 were genotyped by spacer oligonucleotide typing and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit methods .
we included patients who had an isolate that matched the outbreak strain or who had a social link to an already included patient .
patient medical records were reviewed , and infectious periods were calculated . for sputum smear positive patients , the infectious period extended from 3 months before symptom onset or the first positive smear ( whichever was earlier ) until 2 weeks after the start of appropriate tb treatment or until the patient was placed into isolation or produced consecutively negative smears . for sputum smear negative patients , the infectious period extended from 1 month before symptom onset , the start of appropriate tb treatment , or the date that the patient was isolated ( whichever was earlier ) , until 2 weeks after the start of appropriate tb treatment or until patient isolation ( 7 ) .
we interviewed patients to learn their contacts , activities , and locations frequented while they were contagious .
additional contacts were found by outreach workers and a disease intervention specialist from the east - african community who was hired to work in the neighborhoods frequented by the patients . while in these neighborhoods , outreach workers and the disease intervention specialist recruited persons seen with patients or their contacts to be evaluated for tb and latent tb infection .
contact activities , specifically those related to illicit drugs , were observed or self - reported .
friends were defined as contacts of patients who spent time within a close - knit network of young men who exhibited similar marijuana - using behavior .
other contacts were defined as the families and relatives of patients and those who were named but were not closely associated with this network .
contacts received a tb evaluation including a tuberculin skin test ( tst ) to detect infection .
patient 1 was first evaluated in december 2003 , when a chest radiograph suggested pulmonary tb ( i.e. , upper lobe cavitary infiltrate ) .
however , only clarithromycin was prescribed , and the patient was lost to follow - up .
he was again seen in an emergency room in april 2004 after the infection evolved into bilateral extensive pulmonary tb .
eight patients were born in east africa ; a median of 13 years ( range 622 ) had passed since their arrival in the united states .
patient 5 was a white woman who received illicit drugs from patient 1 . * unknown for 1 patient .
patients were symptomatic and had findings indicating infectiousness : all had pulmonary tb , 7 had cavitary disease , and 8 had sputum that tested smear - positive for acid - fast bacilli .
consecutive chest radiographs indicated progression to cavitary disease in  ⁇  75 days weeks in 3 patients and  ⁇  121 days in another patient .
table 2 shows the dates of clear chest radiographs interpreted as normal and the first chest radiographs showing disease . while contagious , patients stayed in various locations , including cars , for most of the day . a single - bedroom apartment occupied by at least 1 patient while he was contagious was regularly visited by 2 other patients .
numerous members of the friend network slept there on any given night , and many others would regularly visit during a 10-week period beginning in april 2004 ( figure ) .
the occupants nailed boards over the apartment windows to conceal activities , primarily marijuana use , from outsiders .
all reported frequent " hotboxing , " the practice of smoking marijuana with others in a vehicle with the windows closed so that exhaled smoke is repeatedly inhaled .
considerable overlap in infectious periods was noted , which highlights the potential for simultaneous contact with multiple contagious patients .
at least 31 ( 57% ) friend contacts spent time at the 1-bedroom apartment . after those with a past positive tst result were removed , 14 ( 64% ) of 22 screened friends and 6 ( 23% ) of 26 other contacts had a positive tst result .
the risk for a positive tst result was 2.8 greater among friends than among other contacts ( 95% confidence interval = 1.36.0 ) .
twenty - nine ( 54% ) friend contacts self - reported or were observed hotboxing . among the friends who reported or
were observed hotboxing , 11 ( 79% ) of 14 who received a tst had a positive result .
risk factors for tb include birth in a country with high tb prevalence ( 2 ) and incarceration ( 8) .
although most patients in this outbreak were foreign - born and had histories of incarceration , genotyping results and epidemiologic findings suggest that tb

heterogenous vancomycin intermediate staphylococcus aureus ( hvisa ) strains have been reported as indicators for reduced vancomycin susceptibility in s. aureus , and various studies associated its presence with vancomycin treatment failure .
it has been shown that methicillin resistant s. aureus ( mrsa ) has the propensity to evolve into hvisa phenotype during in vitro exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin . during the last decade
, hvisas had been isolated in many countries including those in south east asia ; nevertheless , in our knowledge , its emergence has not been reported in malaysia . as a pilot study
, we investigated the prevalence of hvisa among mrsa strains isolated at hospital kuala lumpur ( hkl ) in a 3-month period and determined factors associated with its infections .
hospital kuala lumpur is the largest hospital in malaysia with the highest mrsa burden in the country . in this hospital
, vancomycin is used as the standard first line treatment for mrsa infection ; however , recently , its efficacy has been a subject of discussion due to several anecdotal vancomycin treatment failure cases in hospital kuala lumpur .
we also wondered if some of the mrsas isolated in the hospital were actually hvisas with reduced susceptibilities to vancomycin that could not be detected by routine microbiological tests used in our hospital diagnostic laboratory . to investigate this , from 25 february to 25
may 2009 , we collected a total of 320 index mrsa isolates ( first mrsa isolated from the corresponding patients ) and established them as strains for vancomycin resistance testing . as it is cost , time and labor consuming to perform vancomycin population analysis on all 320 strains to test for heterogenous vancomycin resistance , strains were first screened for the phenotype using glycopeptide resistance detection ( grd ) etest antibiotic strips ( ab biodisk , sweden ) .
after grd screening , a total of 8 strains were defined as presumptive hvisa , no visa strain was detected . following that , to confirm the results of the grd screening
interestingly , area under the curve ( auc ) analyses of the strains ' population analysis profiles confirmed that 7 out of the 8 tested strains were hvisa ( table 1 ) , giving a prevalence rate of 2.19% .

dpp-4 inhibitors are a new class of anti - diabetic agents that improve glucose homeostasis by enhancing the actions of incretin hormones .
vildagliptin has a relatively shorter half - life than other dpp-4 inhibitors and therefore is preferably administered twice daily .
exposure to vildagliptin in patients with moderate - to - severe renal impairment is increased compared with that observed in control subjects .
however , the degree of exposure to vildagliptin does not correspond to the severity of renal impairment .
in contrast , the level of the primary metabolite of ( dpp)-4 ( m20.7 ) increases in association with declines of renal function ; however , increases in the level of this metabolite have no clinically relevant consequences since m20.7 is pharmacologically inactive [ 1 , 2 ] .
therefore , vildagliptin can be used without dose adjustment in patients with a creatinine clearance of > 50 ml / min .
although vildagliptin is , in principle , contraindicated in patients with moderate - to - severe renal impairment , a recent 24-week study suggested that vildagliptin ( 50 mg once daily ) therapy is effective and well tolerated in moderate - to - severe renal impairment patients and those on dialysis with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) [ 3 , 4 ] .
dpp-4 is also known as adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2 or cd26 ( ec 3.4.14.5 ) and is expressed on the surface of several cell types , including lymphocytes and monocytes , where it exerts immunoregulatory effects .
in addition , dpp-4 substrates are proline- and alanine - containing peptides , including various growth factors , chemokines , neuropeptides and vasoactive peptides .
due to these off - target mechanisms , the use of dpp-4 inhibitors may result in unexpected side effects related to immunological responses . in this article
, we report the first case , to our knowledge , of sarcoid - like lung granulomas in a hemodialysis patient treated with vildagliptin .
a 70-year - old female began to receive hemodialysis for end - stage renal disease due to diabetic nephropathy in august 2010 .
her treatment regimen for t2 dm was changed from insulin injections to the oral administration of vildagliptin ( 50 mg / day ) in december 2011 . following the initiation of vildagliptin , the patient 's level of hba1c ranged between 6.0 and 6.3% , and no episodes of hypoglycemia were observed . in april 2012
, multiple nodular lesions were incidentally detected on chest computed tomography ( ct ) screening for lung cancer , without subjective symptoms ( figure 1a ) .
the patient had no pets , was not a smoker , had no experience of traveling overseas or allergies to drugs or foods .
a quantiferon - tb ( qft ) blood test was positive ; however , repeated sputum cultures and polymerase chain reaction assays were negative for tuberculosis ( tb ) .
the multiple nodular lesions increased in size on ct after 2 months ( figure 1c ) ; therefore , a ct - guided needle lung biopsy was performed , and granulomas without caseous necrosis were identified on a histological examination ( figure 2 ) .
no pathogenic microorganisms were detected on staining , including grocott 's methenamine silver and acid - fast staining .
furthermore , there was no evidence of tb on a culture of bronchial alveolar liquid ( bal ) .
because the presence of tb infection could not be completely excluded and the size of the granulomas progressively increased ( figure 1d ) , antituberculosis drugs , including rifampicin ( 450 mg / day ) , isoniazid ( 300 mg / day ) and ethambutol ( 250 mg / two days ) , were administered empirically starting in september 2012 . nevertheless , the granulomas further increased in size on follow - up ct performed 1 month later ( figure 1e ) .
therefore , we discontinued both the antituberculosis drugs and vildagliptin . following the discontinuation of vildagliptin ,
the size of the granulomas decreased within 1 month ( figure 1f ) , and most of the lesions were barely detectable after 4 months ( figure 1 g )

dysphagia is the subjective awareness of difficulty in the passage of solids or liquids from the oropharynx to the stomach .
dysphagia can be classified into an oropharyngeal or an esophageal location , and it is caused by neuromuscular motility disorders and mechanical obstruction.1 ) mechanical dysphagia is associated with intrinsic or extrinsic compression , resulting in progressive intolerance to solids . the term , dysphagia aortica , has been used to describe difficulty in swallowing caused by external compression from an ectatic , tortuous , or aneurysmal aorta as a result of age - related degeneration.2 ) dysphagia aortica is classically seen in elderly women with short stature who have hypertension and kyphosis.3 ) we report herein a patient with dysphagia associated with an aortic aneurysm .
an 86-year - old woman presented with worsening nausea and vomiting . because of her progressive dysphagia to solids for the last 6 months , she had ingested only semisolids and liquids .
three days before seeking evaluation at our hospital , she had difficulty in swallowing liquids , along with nausea and vomiting .
the medical history revealed that she had been diagnosed with primary hypertension , an ascending aortic aneurysm , congestive heart failure , moderate aortic regurgitation , and moderate mitral regurgitation 6 years previously . because of old age
she had undergone vertebroplasty due to multiple compression fractures of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae 5 years ago . on admission to the hospital
the blood pressure was 130/90 mmhg , the pulse rate was 64 beats / min , the respiratory rate was 28 breath / min , the body temperature was 36.0 , the height was 1.43 m , and the body weight was 37 kg .
the physical examination showed a diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and a pansystolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border .
the laboratory findings were as follows : the white blood cell ( wbc ) count was 5,100/mm , the hemoglobin was 11.8 g / dl , the platelet count was 151,000/mm , the blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) was 39.8 mg / dl , the creatinine was 1.5 mg / dl , the total protein was 5.8 g / dl , the albumin was 3.2 g / dl , the lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) was 546
her chest radiograph revealed blunting signs at both costophrenic angles , cardiomegaly with a cardio - thoracic ratio of 0.8 , and an enlarged , tortuous aorta ( fig .
1 ) . computed tomography ( ct ) of the chest demonstrated an enlarged , tortuous aorta ( fig .
the diameters of the ascending thoracic aorta , the descending thoracic aorta , and the proximal abdominal aorta were 7 cm , 6 cm , and 5.3 cm , respectively .
the upper gastrointestinal barium study revealed marked extrinsic compression of the distal esophagus just above the esophagogastric junction ( fig .
we concluded that the symptoms and the results of the imaging studies were consistent with dysphagia aortica .
although we recommended surgical correction of the aortic aneurysm or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy , the patient declined any invasive procedures and she was transferred to a nursing home on the 12 hospital day .
the esophagus normally begins on the right side of the thoracic aorta and then descends .
then , the esophagus lies on the left side of the aorta and penetrates the diaphragm through the diaphragmatic histus.4 ) the aging process and the accompanying degenerative changes with the loss of elasticity causes a dilated , elongated , and distorted aorta , which may result in a so - called reverse c- or reverse s - shaped aorta.3 ) as a result , the esophagus is pushed and compressed by the aorta against the cardiac chambers , which are anterior in location.5 ) there is no gold standard diagnostic procedure for dysphagia aortica .
the association of suggestive symptoms , such as progressive intolerance to solids with concomitant weight loss along with the results of imaging and other diagnostic studies provide a high index of suspicion.6 ) the diagnostic work - up includes radiologic , endoscopic , and manometric studies . on a standard chest radiography and ct scan , the enlargement of the aortic arch and the tortuous dilated aorta can be observed .
a barium swallow test may show partial esophageal obstruction and pulsatile movement of the barium synchronous with aortic pulsation.7 ) endoscopy reveals pulsatile extrinsic compression and stenosis of the lower esophagus with proximal dilatation .
esophageal manometry may demonstrate a localized high pressure band with superimposed pounding that is synchronous with the cardiac pulsation.8 ) however , the typical findings of dysphagia aortica can be inconsistent .
the radiographic findings are often inconclusive because a dilated , tortuous thoracic aorta is frequently encountered in elderly patients

a human being exposes himself to a variety of injuries caused by numerous forces like vehicular accident , social conflict , terrorism , crimes , wars , industrial accident and fall from a height .
the commonly injured organs are the liver , spleen , kidney , intestines , stomach , pancreas , urinary bladder and vessels .
previously all patients with bta ended up in laparotomy and were managed according to the organ injuries .
the advent and development of new techniques like laparoscopy minimally invasive surgery ( mis ) have a diagnostic as well as definitive therapeutic role in bta . the availability of sophisticated instruments , equipments and expert anaesthesiologists make laparoscopy an attractive technique for diagnostic and therapeutic measures in bta .
haemoperitoneum with stable vitals and injury to the liver , spleen , bowel , mesentery and bladder can be managed by laparoscopy .
advanced laparoscopic techniques include bowel resection and anastomosis , ligation of blood vessels can be as efficiently utilised in bta as an elective open surgery.[35 ] one can visualise the peritoneal cavity and act expeditiously if needed ( i.e. , laparotomy , laparoscopic - assisted intervention , or only observation ) at the time of laparoscopy .
this study was planned with the objective of evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of laparoscopy in managing the organ damage in bta .
after institutional ethical committee approval and informed written consent from the patients , a prospective randomised clinical study was carried out in 25 adult patients of either sex , scheduled for laparoscopic intervention in the surgical ward of the government medical college and sir t. hospital , bhavnagar .
patients who sustained haemoperitoneum , confirmed in ultrasonography ( usg ) or computed tomogram ( ct scan ) , with relatively stable haemodynamics , were enrolled in this study ( blood pressure > 80 mm of mercury systolic and > 15 ml / hour urine output ) .
patients with unstable haemodynamics , even after three units of whole blood transfusion ( 1 unit = 300 cc ) and associated edh ( extradural haemorrhage ) / sdh ( subdural haemorrhage ) , compound fracture , spine fracture , severe chest injury with low spo2 (  ⁇  90% ) , haemodynamically unstable , anticipated difficult endotracheal intubation and pregnancy , were excluded .
the three main ports are : 
 umbilical port ( 10 mm)right - sided port ( 5 mm / 10 mm ) lumbar at anterior axillary lineleft - sided port ( 5mm/10 mm ) lumbar at anterior axillary lineextra port , if required , is made according to the organ injury usually in the subxiphoid region or in the lower abdomen .

transdermal drug delivery is a noninvasive route of drug administration into the body through the skin .
however , only a few drug candidates have been successfully developed into suitable transdermal formulations because of the formidable skin barrier .
the highly lipophilic nature of the skin restricts the permeation of hydrophilic , high molecular weight and charged compounds through the stratum corneum into the systemic circulation .
transdermal iontophoresis is defined as application of an electrical potential that maintains a constant electric current across the skin and enhances the delivery of ionized as well as unionized molecules .
it uses an electrode of the same polarity as the charge on the drug to drive ionic drug molecules into the body .
the mechanisms of transdermal iontophoresis include electrorepulsion ( a charged ion is repelled from an electrode with the same charge ) , electro - osmosis ( convective flow of solvent through a charged pore that occurs in response to the preferential passage of counter ions when the electric field is applied ) , and current - induced skin permeability increment .
one of the major advantages of iontophoretic drug delivery is the ability to readily and precisely control the drug - delivery profile through modulating the current output .
methotrexate ( mtx ) is an antineoplastic agent used for the treatment of cancer , psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis .
it is used for the treatment of cancer and at low doses , it has immunosuppressive and anti - inflammatory properties and is used for the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis .
various topical forms like ointments , creams and gels[1518 ] have been tried as the systemic use of this drug causes many side effects mainly , hepatic toxicity and liver damage but are still not available commercially .
the drug can be delivered either in solution formulation or through loading on to the hydrogel patches .
incorporation of the drug into hydrogels facilitates drug handling and release and in case of iontophoretic delivery , allows the patient to remain ambulant .
it has been reported that the iontophoretic delivery of mtx from hydrogels was more effective than passive delivery from aqueous solution .
it has been demonstrated that iontophoresis remarkably improved the transdermal delivery of mtx over passive diffusion .
more interestingly , a case of palmer psoriasis treated with iontophoresis of mtx has been reported using current density for iontophoresis beyond the clinically acceptable limits .
although , the results with iontophoresis are promising , none of the papers give a detailed comparison between high and low current density used for iontophoresis .
the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of current density on mtx permeation as well as to assess the skin injury caused by the above - mentioned physical enhancer by histological examination .
mtx was a gift sample from dabur ( india ) , acrylamide was obtained from spectrochem pvt .

the hydrogel patches were synthesized using acrylamide monomer by solution polymerization method as described by prasad et al . , 2007 .
all experiments were conducted according to the protocol approved by the institutional animal ethics committee ( iaec ) of all india institute of medical sciences , new delhi , india .
white albino mice ( n=5 in each group ) were procured from aiims and sacrificed .
the hair was removed from the abdominal region using an animal hair clipper and the full - thickness skin was excised .
fat adhering to the dermis side was cleaned by using a blunt scalpel and isopropyl alcohol , taking care not to damage the skin .
finally , the skin was washed in tap water and observed physically for any gross damage .
the fresh skin was used , for in vitro , attenuated total reflectance - fourier transform infrared ( atr - ftir ) and histopathological studies . for permeation studies
, the mice skin was clamped between the two half - cells of the modified vertical franz diffusion cell with epidermis facing the donor chamber and the area available for perme

 rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is a chronic , systemic , autoimmune disease , and the most common form of chronic joint inflammation , affecting 0.51% of the uk population .
ra is most prevalent in individuals aged 40 years or older with the risk of developing ra being up to 5 times higher in women . as a consequence of their disease ra
patients typically suffer severe joint pain , reduced muscle strength , and impaired physical function .
although outcomes of the disease have improved with modern approaches to drug treatment , using agents such as methotrexate and biologics , the disease is still a progressive one with long - term joint damage and disability the expectation rather than the rule . 
a major feature of the disease is severe inflammation of the synovium where there is a 3100 times elevation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha ( tnf- ) , interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) , interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) , and c - reactive protein ( crp ) .
the course of ra is typically one of exacerbations and remissions but , even during inactive phases of the disease , systemic levels of cytokines remain dysregulated when compared to those without rheumatoid arthritis .
ra also results in downregulation of anabolic factors for muscle , for example , muscle levels of insulin - like growth factor i ( igf-1 ) .
the circulating levels of cytokines reflect disease activity and level of inflammation present and also may play a significant role in the systemic effects of the disease , such as vascular disease and rheumatoid cachexia .
in addition to the articular features of the disease , ra is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) [ 7 , 8 ] .
the relative risk of myocardial infarction is estimated to be double in women with ra relative to those without , and cvd events typically occur a decade earlier and to a greater extent in patients with ra relative to healthy controls ; sometimes even before the fulfilment of all criteria of ra .
a recent meta - analysis of 24 studies , comprising 111,758 patients with 22,927 cardiovascular events , reported a 50% increased risk of cvd deaths in patients with ra compared with the general population .
this increase in cvd in ra patients appears to be independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors .
given that chronic low - grade inflammation is thought to play an important role in the underlying cause of cvd , atherosclerosis , it seems reasonable to hypothesize that systemic inflammation contributes to elevated cvd in persons with ra . 
most ra patients also suffer from an accelerated loss of muscle mass , a condition known as rheumatoid cachexia .
this loss contributes to disability and has a significant impact on an individuals ' quality of life .
rheumatoid cachexia has been reported in two thirds of all ra patients , including patients with stable ra [ 5 , 14 ] .
roubenoff and colleagues proposed that rheumatoid cachexia is caused by the cytokine - driven ( principally tnf- ) hypermetabolism and protein degradation . however , poor nutrition and low physical activity levels are also believed to contribute .
it has been demonstrated that ra patients do less exercise than their healthy counterparts ; more than 80% of ra patients are physically inactive in some countries , whilst in the uk it is believed that approximately 68% of ra patients are physically inactive .
the extreme physical inactivity of ra patients ' becomes a vicious circle in terms of health and disease progression .
thus it has become apparent that encouraging physical activity is an important and essential part of the overall treatment of ra .
the purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of exercise in patients with ra and to demonstrate the multitude of beneficial effects that a properly designed exercise intervention has in this population . in order to present this aim
firstly , a brief explanation of the background of ra and the benefits of exercise in the general population is presented .
secondly , the benefits of exercise in ra are highlighted , focusing on the areas of cardiovascular disease , musculoskeletal and joint health , and overall function .
thirdly , the perceptions of ra patients regarding exercise are discussed and finally exercise prescription for ra is reviewed .
this expert review has been derived from a combination of systematic reviews and other research papers focusing on randomised controlled trials , published guidelines , the recent literature , and also making use of our own specialised experience .
it is not within the scope of this review to discuss the benefits of standard low - intensity physiotherapy techniques such as range of motion , stretching , and/or specific joint strengthening .
the review , however , does encompass a range of physical activity and physical exercise .
we broadly define physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles resulting in energy expenditure above resting levels and physical exercise ( exercise or exercise training

dietary sugar intake , in the form of sucrose or high - fructose corn syrup ( hfcs ) , has dramatically increased and correlates with a rise in obesity , metabolic syndrome , and diabetes .
because a broad range of physiological , behavioural , and neurological variables influences food choices and eating behaviour , it is difficult to understand the mechanisms of eating behaviour and their alterations .
the hedonic value of highly palatable foods and their wide availability can override the physiological mechanisms related to energy homeostasis [ 2 , 3 ] .
the hedonic reward value of food is closely linked to the sensory perception of food ( including food taste , odour , and texture ) and refers to the driving force behind the motivation to eat .
the nutrient detection by the gut is mainly controlled by enteroendocrine ( ee ) cells and might activate a cascade of physiological phenomena , including endocrine regulations ( e.g. insulin , leptin , glucagon - like peptide-1 or glp-1 , secretion ) , inhibition of gastric emptying , inhibition of food intake , stimulation of intake as well as psychobehavioural responses .
dietary sugar overconsumption might provoke deleterious effects at both central and peripheral levels , including alterations in ( i ) the regulation of secretion of satiety peptides and neuropeptides [ 7 , 8 ] ; ( ii ) gut permeability leading to low - grade inflammation and liver disease ; ( iii ) blood brain barrier ( bbb ) permeability ; ( iv ) the endocannabinoid , opioid , and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems , as well as ( v ) brain structures involved in reward processing .
both drugs and food have powerful reinforcing effects partly mediated by dopamine increases in the limbic system that , under certain circumstances or in vulnerable individuals , could overwhelm the brain s homeostatic control mechanisms , but the plausibility of sugar addiction and its role in obesity and eating disorders in humans is still a subject of controversy .
much of the research on the effects of dietary sugars on health has recently focused on fructose , given the striking parallel increases in obesity and in fructose intake over the past decades .
these studies have found important fructose - induced health disturbances that are different from those provoked by glucose or sucrose .
most of fructose intake in diets originates from sucrose ( containing 50 % fructose and 50 % glucose ) and soft drinks containing high - fructose corn syrup ( hfcs ) ( range 4765 % fructose , and 5335 % glucose ) .
an estimate of the consumption of hfcs from beverages indicates a daily range between 132 and 316 kcal for americans aged over 2 years , and patients with non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) consume twofold more calories from hfcs from beverages than healthy patients ( 365 vs. 170 kcal / day ) . in the united states , average fructose consumption from sugar - sweetened beverages has increased from 37 to 49 g / day during the last 30 years ( + 0.4 % per year ) .
thus , it is not clear whether the fructose - induced metabolic disturbances observed in human and animal studies are due to fructose itself or the associated increase in energy intake .
moreover , since fructose and glucose intake may vary simultaneously , this raises the consideration that other dietary sugars ( e.g. sucrose and glucose ) might also contribute to the development of obesity and associated co - morbidities .
in fact , there are controversial findings on metabolic effects between the different sugars ( i.e. glucose , fructose , and sucrose ) .
while some studies have disclosed significant differences between these sugars , other studies have found small or no difference .
for example , in overweight or obese humans , intake of a fructose - sweetened beverage led to a significant increase in visceral adipose tissue , hepatic de novo lipogenesis , and postprandial triglycerides compared to subjects offered a glucose - sweetened beverage . in lean and obese subjects , de novo lipogenesis increased to the same extent after overfeeding with glucose and sucrose .
both high - glucose and high - fructose diets stimulated lipogenic gene expression in rodents .
most of the studies on the effects of sugars on health and disease , at both peripheral and central levels , have been performed in rodents , and studies are missing in humans or other animal models closer to humans , such as the pig model .
given that human studies are limited due to ethical considerations , future studies should privilege the use of animal models that closely resembles humans .
on the other hand , there is an impressive number of studies available concerning the effects of dietary sugars , using different experimental paradigms , with different approaches , animal models , oral intake doses , in the form of sugar solutions or added in the diet

when a limb muscle is stretched , changes in the expression of myosin heavy chain ( myhc ) , the protein primarily responsible for the contractile speed and metabolism type of muscle fibers , are observable within days.1 when stretched , muscle fibers tend to change from a fast phenotype ( mainly comprising myhc iib ) to a slow phenotype ( consisting mainly of myhc i or rarely i).1 - 6 these changes , although controversial , occur along a continuum of changes in the expression of myhcs from isoform iib to iso form i.7 in addition , the expression of less common isoforms , such as embryonic or neonatal myhcs ( developmental myhcs ) , may also be increased.8 the same responses might occur in the masticatory muscles after an increase in occlusal vertical dimension and/or mandibular advancement.9,10 in animal models , functional appliances commonly used for orthodontic treatment induce a phenotypic change in masticatory muscle fibers , with a tendency toward transition to a slow phenotype.11,12 slow fibers are fatigue resistant and easily convertible to fast fibers ; in comparison , fast fibers are fatigable but difficult to convert to slow fibers .
therefore , in a masticatory muscle stretched by a functional appliance , the fiber composition would gradually balance as the orofacial structures grow and then , treatment effects would be sustained without relapse provided that the new fiber proportion is maintained .
however , a phenotypic change appears to occur only within the fast fiber population , and a definite molecular change among slow fibers remains controversial.9,10,13 the aims of this study were to examine whether a passive stretch stimulus by means of a functional appliance induces changes in the fiber composition of masticatory muscles and whether these changes are similar to the changes in stretched leg muscle fibers by using rt - pcr , western blot , and immunohistochemical assays .
eight male growing new zealand white rabbits with an average weight of 2.5 kg and average age of 11 weeks were divided into control and experimental groups , consisting of 3 and 5 rabbits , respectively . under the assumption that the myhc composition in the masticatory muscles of the control animals would vary less than that in the experimental animals ,
the rabbits were brought to the institutional animal facility and allowed to acclimate for 2 weeks . in the experimental group ,
each animal was sedated with ketamine ( 40 mg / kg i.m . ) and xylazine ( 5 mg / kg i.m . ) , the maxillary central incisors were etched with 37% phosphoric acid , and a prefabricated nickel - chromium inclined plane was fitted on these teeth ( figure 1 ) by using glass ionomer cement ( principle ; dentsply caulk , milford , de , usa ) .
this inclined - plane appliance was designed to force the mandible approximately 2 mm forward and approximately 4 mm downward .
the control group did not receive this appliance.11 while sedated , the experimental and control animals also received a cast ( vetcast ; 3 m , st .
paul , mn , usa ) to stretch 1 hind limb as described by yang et al.,5 the limb was extended at an angle of 110 before casting as previously described.14,15 consequently , the extensor digitorum longus ( edl ) was stretched when the animal walked on this limb .
the rabbits had free access to pellet food and water . at the end of the 1-week experimental period ,
they were sacrificed with an overdose injection of ketamine - xylazine along with placement in a co2 chamber .
the masseter ( superficial and deep parts ) , lateral pterygoid , and edl of both hind limbs were dissected immediately after the animals were sacrificed .
three representative regions from the mid - belly of each muscle were sectioned into 1-cm square pieces , flash - frozen in isopentane , cooled in liquid nitrogen , and stored at -80 for later sectioning .

acommon problem in clinical laboratories is maintaining the stability of serum analytes during sample storage .
samples are usually stored in the door ( 48c ) of a refrigerator for short durations or in a deep freezer ( 20c ) for longer time periods .
thus , the temperature at which the samples are stored constitutes an important preanalytical variable that may affect analysis results in the clinical biochemistry laboratory setting .
these laboratories face many challenges including equipment breakdown and the lack of reagents , which can prevent same - day processing of samples . in such cases ,
the only option is to preserve the samples in a deep freezer ( 20c ) .
in addition , samples are sometimes stored for an extended duration until subjected to routine batch analysis for research purposes .
previous studies have provided information regarding the stability of analytes in serum using a number of methods that have since become obsolete .
although many blood analytes have been shown to deteriorate within hours in unseparated samples kept at ambient temperature , the few studies examining unseparated samples stored at low temperatures involved prolonged contact between serum and cells , which could have caused erroneous test results . moreover ,
the stability of 72 analytes following prolonged serum - cell contact has been previously described .
the effects of prolonged storage on the stability of 31 analytes in plasma and serum separated from cells with a gel barrier have also been reported .
a number of studies have described approximately thirty analytes in serum immediately separated from cells .
in addition , several studies have examined the effect of storage conditions on the stability of various serum components . however , limited information is available regarding the stability of commonly used clinical biochemical analytes in human serum including the effect of storage temperatures as low as 20c on blood - separated serum .
therefore , the present study examined the stability of 17 routine chemistry analytes in immediately cell - separated serum following storage at a designated temperature ( 20c ) for different periods ( 0 , 7 , 15 , and 30 days ) using the previously described standard guidelines for blood sample handling and separation .
this hospital - based study included ten random samples from outpatients being treated at the hospital clinics .
the samples collected from each patient were for physician - ordered laboratory testing ; no additional blood was taken from the subjects .
the institutional ethical committee approved the study , and informed consent was obtained from all the participants .
all procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the helsinki declaration on human experimentation .
fasting venous blood ( total of 6 ml blood ) was collected in the morning using a vacuette standard tube holder and vacuette 22ga 1 ( 0.7 mm 25 mm ) multisample needle ( becton , dickinson and company , usa ) .
the blood specimens were drawn into 7.5 ml plastic vacuette serum tubes ( bd vacutainer serum ; bd , franklin lakes nj , usa ) .
the sample tubes were left in an upright position for 30 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min .
the serum samples of each subject were pooled into a plain tube and then aliquoted into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes ( eppendorf , milano , italy ) ; four aliquots per patient samples were kept ( three for storage at 20c ) and the remaining serum was used for the baseline measurement ( t1d ) .
the serum aliquots were stored frozen at 20c for either 7 ( t7d ) , 15 ( t15d ) , or 30 ( t30d ) days and then analyzed separately for stability .
the following analytes were examined : [ table 1 ] methods used for measuring biochemical parameters 
 metabolites : na , k , urea , creatinine , uric acid , total calcium , phosphorus , direct bilirubin , and total bilirubinproteins : total protein and albuminlipids : total cholesterol and triglyceridesenzymes : alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) , alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) , and amylase .

the random sample comprises 267 caucasian preadolescents ( 121 girls , 146 boys ) and 330 caucasian adolescents ( 164 girls , 166 boys ) of a population belonging to the swedish part of the european youth heart study ( eyhs ) .
the eyhs is a cross - sectional school - based study of risk factors for future cardiovascular disease among preadolescents ( 910 years old ) and adolescents ( 1516 years old ) .
the mean ages in the swedish sample for preadolescents and adolescents were 9.6 years and 15.6 years , respectively .
height , weight , and birth weight were measured by internationally accepted standardised procedures ( 22 ) .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight / height2 ( kg / m ) .
identification of sexual maturity was assessed according to tanner and whitehouse 1976 . a researcher of the same gender as the child recorded the pubertal stage after brief observation . on account of ethical reasons
the direction of one school preferred not to take part in the assessment of sexual maturity .
fifty subjects did therefore not participate in this assessment ( 3 preadolescent girls , 7 preadolescent boys , 25 adolescent girls , and 15 adolescent boys ) .
the consumption of milk was assessed by an interviewer - mediated 24-hour recall . in preadolescents ,
a qualitative food record completed the day before the interview with the help of parents served as a checklist for the data obtained during the recall .
dietary data were processed by stormats ( version 4.02 , rudans lttdata , sweden ) and analysed using the swedish national food database ( version 99.1 ) . as part of a broad - ranging questionnaire , parents of the participants were asked if their child had a chronic illness or adhered to a special diet . since under - nourishment is practically non - existent in a nutritionally replete population such as sweden and milk intake accounts in part for daily energy intake , the bmi was taken as proxy for energy intake .
furthermore , bmi is traditionally used to validate energy intake data ( 23 ) . for the genetic analysis of lp and lnp ,
genomic dna was isolated from edta whole blood samples from the individuals with the qiaamp dna blood mini kit spin procedure .
the dna fragment spanning the -13910-c / t polymorphic site was amplified using a biotinylated forward - primer ( 5 gggctggcaatacagataagata-3 ) and an unbiotinylated reverse - primer ( 5 agcagggctcaaagaacaatcta-3 ) .
the applied sequencing primer was : 5-ctttgaggccaggg-3. sequencing was performed using a psq96 snp reagent kit and a psq 96ma system ( pyrosequencing ab ) psq 96ma 2.0.1 software .
the procedure has been previously described in detail ( 24 , 25 ) . for the determination of socio - economic status ( ses ) we used the dichotomous variable , below versus above the mean income level in the catchment areas of the sample ( below or above the mean in their municipality ) on account of the relatively equal distribution of income in sweden ( 26 ) . for four subjects , data for ses
student 's t - test was used to determine differences in milk intake ( g / d ) between lp and lnp subjects .
milk intake ( g / d ) was somewhat skewed to the right and therefore split in quintiles of milk intake .
stepwise backward multiple linear regression analysis was performed in order to study the relationship between milk intake in quintiles and body height ( cm ) after adjustments for sex , birth weight ( g ) , father 's and mother 's height ( cm ) , bmi , tanner stage ( 15 ) , and ses .
the study was approved by the research ethics committees of rebro county council and huddinge university hospital .
parents and 15-year - olds gave specific written informed consent to participate in the study .
the variables included in the backward multivariate regression model were : milk intake , lct c > t-13910 polymorphism ( lp = ct , tt vs. lnp = cc ) , sex , birth weight , father 's and mother 's height , bmi , tanner stage , and ses .
characteristics of preadolescents and adolescents by quintile of milk intake are given in table 2 .

conserved domains in proteins have crucial roles in protein interactions , dna binding , enzyme activity and other important cellular processes . with recently released predictions of the number of genes in the human genome being less than many previous predictions , interactions among protein domains
protein domains are often conserved across many species and , as such , they offer an interesting dataset for analyzing how genomes maintain any given domain in relation to other conserved domains , as well as for analyzing the relationship of conserved domain occurrence to proteome size .
many groups have attempted to find , document and annotate these conserved domains . whereas most groups use a form of hidden markov models for profiling , each group approaches the problem in a unique way , yielding a wide range of databases that can be used to verify each other . for this study
i used the smart cd database to collect data on the number of genes containing each conserved domain in each genome .
the study was restricted to the five eukaryote genomes sequenced so far : homo sapiens , drosophila melanogaster , arabidopsis thaliana , caenorhabditis elegans and saccharomyces cerevisiae .
results were confirmed using a repository of databases called the proteome analysis database ( abbreviated here as pad ) .
it has been possible to compare conserved domains across different genomes , and to validate the approach by using a repository of databases ( pad ) and one database from this group ( smart ) .
a close link is revealed between numbers of genes with a given conserved domain and the total number of genes in each genome .
data were gathered as follows : a perl script was written to submit requests to the smart database for the number of genes with each of 519 conserved domains in each genome .
information in pad is already in genome - specific columns for the 200 most frequent conserved domains in humans and was downloaded directly .
the information was parsed and stored for each genome . from the smart database , 211 conserved domains were selected on the basis of the fact that they occurred at least once in each of the five genomes ( see additional data files ) . from pad ,
122 conserved domains were selected on the basis of the fact that they occurred at least once in each of the five genomes ( see additional data files ) .
my initial observation was that for many conserved domains , the ratio of the sum of genes in genome 1 containing the conserved domain to the total number of predicted genes in genome 1 was proportional to the ratio of the sum of genes in genome 2 containing the conserved domain to the total number of predicted genes in genome 2 . given that : a = sum of proteins with given conserved domain ( cd ) in genome 1 ; b= sum of proteins with given cd in genome 2 ; e= sum of predicted genes in genome 1 ; f= sum of predicted genes in genome 2 , then on average : upon rearranging equation 1 , it was noted that for many conserved domains the ratio of the number of genes containing the given conserved domain in each genome accurately reflected the ratio of the total predicted number of genes ach genome . or , given the variables in equation 1 , then on average : to normalize the data i used a ratio of the sum genes with a given conserved domain in a genome to the sum genes with the given conserved domain in all five genomes .
this was used to minimize the effect that the predicted number of genes may be significantly wrong for one of the genomes whereas the others may be more accurate .
equation 1 was rewritten to reflect this normalization . given that a= sum proteins with given cd in genome 1 ; g= sum proteins with given cd in five genomes ; e = sum predicted genes in genome 1 ; h= sum predicted genes for all five genomes , then on average : the sums of conserved domains in each equation 3 ratio range were depicted graphically for each genome , and are displayed in figure 1 ( smart database ) and figure 2 ( pad ) .
the average ratio for each genome was calculated and multiplied against the sum predicted genes of all five genomes , yielding a number close to the number of predicted genes in each respective genome ( table 1 ) .
equation 2 could be used to predict total genes in a genome given that the other variables are reasonably well known , such as from expressed sequence tag ( est ) data .
more important , this suggests the possibility that these conserved domains are maintained in this ratio as a result of functional constraints on interacting domains .
the fact that this ratio is maintained fairly well in all five eukaryotic genomes attests to its potential importance .
although there is much disagreement on the total number of genes for the different genomes , similar gene - finding methods were used for each of the five published eukaryotic genomes .
it can therefore be assumed that ratios of

from november 2008 through may 2010 , m. tuberculosis isolates were cultured during routine care of adults > 18 years of age with primary tb and no history of treatment .
the patients were from 2 regional referral centers , the irkutsk regional tb - prevention dispensary and the research practice center for phthisiatry ( yakutia ) ; the study was approved by the institutional review boards at the university of virginia and irkutsk state medical university .
initial pretreatment isolates were grown on lowenstein - jensen agar slants and identified to species in accordance with world health organization recommendations .
drug susceptibility was tested by absolute concentration method on agar slants ; drugs tested were rifampin ( critical concentration 40 g / ml ) , isoniazid ( 1 g / ml and 10 g / ml ) , ethambutol ( 2 g / ml ) , streptomycin ( 10 g / ml ) , ethionamide ( 30 g / ml ) , and kanamycin ( 30 g / ml ) .
dna extraction was performed on all isolates , followed by 12-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit 
variable number tandem repeat ( miru - vntr ) analysis ( 7 ) and further lineage definition by region of difference deletions , or for ural strains as described ( 5 ) .
phylogenetic tree construction was based on the miruvntrplus database ( 8) , and vntr international type numbers were confirmed on the sitvit database ( 9 ) .
dna from mdr isolates was amplified and sequenced for the known drug - resistance determining regions katg , inha , rpob , embb , gyra , rrs , and eis by using methods described by the centers for disease control and prevention ( 10 ) .
sequences were compared with published sequences for m. tuberculosis h37rv by using genedoc version 2.7.0 . among 235 patients with primary tb ( 130 from yakutia , 105 from irkutsk ) , isoniazid monoresistance was found in isolates from 16 ( 12% ) from yakutia and 19 ( 18% ) from irkutsk ( p = 0.27 ) .
multidrug resistance was found for 61 patients ( 36 [ 28% ] from yakutia and 25 [ 24% ] from irkutsk ) ( p = 0.55 ) .
mean age ( sd ) for these 61 patients was 33 ( 12 ) years , 40 ( 66% ) were male , and these characteristics did not differ significantly between patients from irkutsk and from yakutia .
however , no hiv - infected patients were identified from yakutia compared with 11 ( 44% with mdr tb ) from irkutsk ( p ⁇ 0.001 ) .
twelve mdr tb patients from irktutsk died ( outcome unknown for the other 13 patients ) , including all with hiv , compared with 4 ( 11% ) from yakutia who died ( p = 0.002 ) .
follow - up varied and was limited mostly to inpatients . among all 235 patients with primary tb ,
strains of the beijing family were significantly more common among those from irkutsk ( 70 [ 67% ] ) than from yakutia ( 40 [ 31% ] ) ( p ⁇ 0.001 ) .
however , strains found in yakutia ( s 256 [ 11% ] , t 8 [ 7% ] , and ural 171 [ 5% ] ) were not found in irkutsk ( table 1 ) .
the cluster of s 256 ( miru profile 233325153325 ) was the most common among primary mdr tb isolates from yakutia and was fully 86% mdr ( table 1 ; technical appendix ) .

radical prostatectomy ( rp ) is considered to be a standard curative procedure for patients with organ - confined prostate cancer .
recently , the advent of pioneering nerve - sparing robot - assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( ns ralp ) has significantly increased the potency rate after rp [ 1 - 3 ] . however , even if ns ralp is performed , a large number of patients still experience erectile dysfunction ( ed ) after surgery . therefore , the need for better penile rehabilitation is anticipated . this increase in need for penile rehabilitation stems from two pillars .
first , the introduction of prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) testing in the 1990s made early detection of prostate cancer possible .
the early screening using psa testing led to a significant drop in patient age , and younger prostate cancer patients have great interest in and need for erectile function ( ef ) after surgery .
second , recent advances in surgical techniques have motivated more prostate cancer patients to consider penile rehabilitation .
ns ralp by an experienced surgeon can minimize nerve injury , and early penile rehabilitation with oral administration of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors ( pde5-is ) can maximize penile recovery in ed patients after rp . after the advent of the orally administered pde5-is in 1998 , there was a huge shift in the ed treatment algorithm .
recent literature shows that pde5-is are safe and effective in treating ed patients after rp .
once daily administration of pde5-is has been experimentally proven to have a protective role in ed , and early administration of pde5-is helps to prevent cavernosal hypoxia , which leads to smooth muscle apoptosis and penile fibrosis [ 8 - 11 ] .
although pde5-is are one of the standard treatments for ed after rp , consensus has not been reached on their use , such as when to start , which drug is best , which dosage to use , how long to use , and when to stop . in the case of tadalafil ,
doses of 10 and 20 mg have been administered on demand to ed patients , and once - a - day dosing of 5 mg has been used since the korea food and drug administration approval in 2008 . moreover , in a study that compared the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of on - demand tadalafil and daily dosed tadalafil for the treatment of ed , 72% of the patients preferred daily dosed tadalafil .
however , clinical studies on the daily administration of low - dose pde5-is and the effect of such treatment on ed patients after rp are sorely lacking .
the present study was therefore conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily use of tadalafil 5 mg in the treatment of ed patients after ralp .
we evaluated the records of 116 patients who , between september 2007 and december 2011 , had undergone ralp by an experienced surgeon for localized prostate cancer at our institution .
ralp was first performed in 2004 as a joint effort between our institution and singapore general hospital , which was the site of the initial korean experience .
standard ralp techniques including bladder neck preservation and posterior urethral reconstruction were used because these techniques during ralp can have favorable impacts on the early postoperative recovery of continence .
the 116 patients who developed ed after ns ralp , who had normal preoperative ef , and whose local clinical stage was t2 or lower with a gleason score lower than 8 and a serum psa of less than 20 ng before surgery were included in the study .
the additional exclusion of 24 patients who underwent hormonal or radiation therapy preoperatively or postoperatively , who received any kind of preoperative ed treatment , or to whom pde5-is could not be prescribed resulted in 92 patients .
the 92 patients were retrospectively evaluated in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional review board at dong - a university hospital . in a study of the 92 patients ,
47 patients were prescribed tadalafil at a dose of 5 mg per day . in the tadalafil group , all patients took 5 mg tadalafil per day 1 hour before bedtime .
for all 47 patients , oral intake of tadalafil 5 mg was initiated early after foley catheter removal , between 2 and 3 weeks after the surgery .
the tadalafil group was then stratified depending on the ns procedure they had undergone : bilateral ns ( n=30 ) and unilateral ns ( n=17 ) .
postoperative ef was assessed through the patients ' responses to the korean version of the five - item international index of erectile function ( iief-5 ) questionnaire , which is also referred to as the sexual health inventory of men .

integration of several quantum dot ( qd ) devices on a single chip offers the advantages of compact size , high speed and low optical losses , added to the advantages discrete qd devices offer due to three - dimensional carrier confinement in the active region .
ion implantation induced intermixing is a technique that is compatible with planar processing and can be used for band gap tuning , essential for device integration .
ion implantation induced intermixing has been widely used for band gap tuning of quantum wells ( qw ) and qds [ 3 - 8 ] .
though there are many reports on band gap tuning of qds , there are no reports to date on multi - color qd lasers using ion implantation induced intermixing . in this letter , we report on multi - wavelength qd lasers fabricated using implantation induced intermixing .
we first demonstrate differential band gap shift and effect on carrier confinement and energy level spacing in qds due to ion implantation induced intermixing , using photoluminescence ( pl )
. then we report on multi - color qd lasers and discuss the effect of intermixing induced changes in confinement and energy level separation in the active region on the performance of the devices .
the thin p - clad laser structures studied in this work were grown by metal - organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd ) system .
trimethylindium , trimethylgallium and ash3 with h2 as the carrier gas were used as the precursor sources ; silane and ccl4 were used as n- and p - type dopant sources , respectively .
the active region of the lasers consisted of five layers of in0.5ga0.5as qds incorporated into gaas barrier layers .
100 kev protons at a dose of 5 10 cm were implanted into the active region , wherever mentioned . following implantation ,
the device structures were annealed at 600 c for 30 min in the presence of ash3 .
annealing conditions were chosen to maximize the room temperature ( rt ) pl recovery from the qds in the active region .
pl spectra from the active region of the devices were obtained prior to device fabrication by exciting the samples using a 635 nm laser and collecting the luminescence using a cooled ingaas detector .
four micrometers wide ridge wave - guide lasers were fabricated from the annealed and as - grown laser structures using the standard device processing steps .
the as - cleaved devices were tested at rt in pulsed mode ( duty cycle 5% ) .
first , we present results demonstrating differential band gap shift and the effect of annealing on the carrier confinement and separation between consecutive energy levels in the qds in the active region of the laser structure . due to larger effective mass of holes compared to that of electrons ,
the hole energy levels are closely spaced than the electron energy levels and holes are less confined than the electrons in the as - grown sample .
interdiffusion has the same effect on hole energy levels as that on electron energy levels , but we only discuss the effect of interdiffusion on carriers with higher confinement ( electrons ) , as the device performance is affected mainly by changes in electron confinement rather than the hole confinement .
figure 1 shows the 10 k pl spectra from the active region of the device structures annealed with and without implantation . for the un - implanted region , the qd ground state ( gs )
luminescence peaks at 1015 nm ( p1 ) . due to enhanced interdiffusion caused by proton implantation ,
the qd gs luminescence peak ( p1 ) from the implanted region is blue shifted with respect to peak p1 from the un - implanted region . under the implantation and annealing conditions used in this study ,
peaks p2 and p2 represent qd excited state ( es ) transitions in un - implanted and implanted samples , respectively .

the three compounds lincomycin ( a natural antibiotic produced by streptomyces lincolnensis and discovered in 1961 ) , clindamycin , and pirlimycin ( two semi - synthetic derivatives of lincomycin ) comprise a group of clinically important antibiotics known as lincosamides . the structure of lincomycin ( fig . 
1a ) can be divided into two parts , a pyrrolidine derivative and a six - atom sugar ring ( methylthiolincosamide ) , which are linked via an amide bond in the central part of the molecule .
1b ) is obtained by 7(s)-chloro - substitution of the 7(r)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin , and pirlimycin ( fig . 
1c ) is obtained by trimming the propyl group of clindamycin to get an ethyl group .
these compounds are soluble in water and chemically stable both in the dry state and in solution.fig .
1chemical structures of lincosamides : lincomycin ( natural antibiotic , a ) and its semi - synthetic derivatives clindamycin ( b ) and pirlimycin ( c ) chemical structures of lincosamides : lincomycin ( natural antibiotic , a ) and its semi - synthetic derivatives clindamycin ( b ) and pirlimycin ( c ) lincosamides block bacterial protein synthesis , which takes place on the ribosomes .
the bacterial 70s ribosome can be separated into two subunits : large ( 50s ) and small ( 30s ) , named after their sedimentation coefficients .
the small subunit of prokaryotic ribosomes consists of 21 proteins and one 16s rna chain , while the large subunit contains over 30 proteins and two rna chains ( 23s rna and 5s rna ) .
lincosamides bind to the 23s rna ( interacting with the a- and p - trna binding sites ) of the 50s ribosomal subunit and inhibit the peptidyltransferase reaction , i.e. , peptide bond formation .
the main spectrum of action of lincosamides includes bacteria associated with skin infections , and lincosamides are first - choice antibiotics used in veterinary dermatology .
however , although they do have adverse effects , such as nausea , rash , or abdominal pain , lincomycin and clindamycin are also effectively used in human medicine .
lincosamides are effective against gram - positive bacteria , such as staphylococcus , streptococcus , most anaerobic bacteria ( e.g. , bacteroides fragilis ) , and some protozoa . in the latter case
gram - negative bacteria are , in general , resistant to lincosamides , with one important exception : capnocytophaga canimorsus .
lincosamides exhibit excellent pharmacokinetic properties ; they are well absorbed orally and can penetrate well into infected skin .
also , the minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic90 , the minimum concentration needed to inhibit growth overnight in 90% of organisms ) of clindamycin towards streptococcus pyogenes is over 120 times lower than that of tetracycline .
unfortunately , extensive use of these antibiotics has led to increased resistance in many strains of bacteria , which have been developing various mechanisms to counter these drugs .
one known mechanism is structural modification of the drug s target ( ribosome ) through the methylation of 23s rna ( e.g. , base no .
2058 ) and/or mutations ( e.g. , of bases g2057 , a2058 , a2059 , c2452 , and c2611 ) . other mechanisms of resistance are active efflux of the drug across the cell surface , or its enzymatic deactivation
. bacterial resistance together with side effects are the most important reasons for improving known lincosamides and designing modified compounds .
the conformational properties of free clindamycin and lincomycin have been studied using x - ray techniques [ 9 , 10 ] as well as h and c nmr spectroscopy and molecular dynamics . however , verdier et al . 
ribosome interactions by two - dimensional transferred nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy ( trnoesy ) , and showed that the conformation of the lincosamide plays a crucial role in its binding to the ribosome .
they found that the free conformers of clindamycin and linb ( lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase ) enzyme - bound clindamycin are similar .

penile squamous cell carcinoma ( pscc ) , the predominant histological type ( > 95% ) of penile cancer , is a relatively rare malignant tumor in western countries and japan .
pscc is a rare disease , making it difficult to establish a standard of care in any of the clinical stages , particularly in advanced disease .
multimodal treatments , including surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation therapy , should be considered for patients with advanced pscc . however , the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen is unknown , although cisplatin - containing chemotherapy is the mainstay of combination chemotherapy .
recent studies have suggested that taxanes in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil ( 5-fu ) have a significant effect on unresectable and recurrent penile cancer .
malignant wound , results in a decline in the quality of life because of the presence of bleeding , exudates , and/or strong odor .
mohs chemosurgery is a technique of chemical fixation of a cutaneous tumor and subsequent excision .
several studies have shown the efficacy of mohs paste for maintaining malignant wounds in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the breast , skin , head , and neck [ 4 , 5 ] .
we report a case of a pscc with advanced lymph node metastasis treated with combination therapy consisting of taxane - based chemotherapy , irradiation , and mohs paste .
an 80-year - old male presented to a community hospital with pain and redness in his left inguinal region .
he had undergone penectomy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy 1 year ago because of primary pscc ( pt1pn0 ) .
a large solid mass with bleeding and a smelly exudate was observed in his left inguinal region .
macroscopically , the tumor mass of the left inguinal region was 7.0 cm in diameter with an ulcer , redness , and exudate ( fig .
a ct scan revealed a huge mass ( 5.9 5.8 cm ) in the left inguinal region along with his left femoral vessels ( fig .
he was administered combination therapy consisting of a taxane - based chemotherapy , irradiation , and mohs chemosurgery .
the chemotherapy regimen consisted of 60 mg / m docetaxel administered over 3 h on day 1 ; 750 mg / m 5-fu on days 15 ; and 70 mg / m cisplatin on day 4 .
the patient also received 50-gy external - beam radiation therapy to the left inguinal region , initiated on the same day of chemotherapy .
mohs paste was applied every morning with a surrounding gauze to avoid attaching with normal skin ( as previously reported ) .
mohs paste included 50 ml of zinc chloride - saturated aqueous solution , 10 g of zinc powder , and 15 ml of glycerin .
radiation therapy was temporarily deferred for 12 days beginning on day 9 because of neutropenia and general fatigue .
the necrotic tissue fell off and the wound flattened on day 20 after starting chemotherapy .
2b ) , and a ct scan showed that the tumor had decreased by 70% in diameter at 1 month after the first course of chemotherapy ( fig .
3b ) . because of socio - economic reasons , the patient declined additional treatment .
there was no progression or metastasis on the chest and abdominal ct for 8 months .
however , the wound grew and became erosive again 10 months after discharge , and the patient died because of the progression of local recurrence 1 year after chemotherapy treatment .
in our patient with inguinal recurrence of pscc , multimodal treatment , consisting of combination chemotherapy , irradiation , and mohs chemosurgery , was responsible for the tumor shrinkage and the successful local control of a malignant wound .
although this field is limited by a paucity of clinical trials or prospective data , the available single institutional retrospective reviews indicate that multiagent cisplatin - based chemotherapy regimens fight significantly against pscc . in 1991 , dexeus et al . 
reported a triple - drug chemotherapy regimen , which soon became a standard regimen for pscc with tolerable adverse effects .
the regimen consisted of 20 mg / m cisplatin on days 26 , 200 mg / m methotrexate on days 1 and 15 , and 10 mg / m bleomycin on days 26 .
they reported a response in 10 of 14 ( 71% ) patients ( with moderate side effects ) . in their follow - up studies ,
a lower rate of complete responses with severe toxicities was reported [ 8 , 9 ] . with respect to scc of the head and neck , in which p

hookworm is one of important soil - transmitted helminthes ( sth ) for humans around the world .
human infection by hookworms induces blood loss , iron - deficiency anemia , and other anemia associated - symptoms and signs .
necator is rather prevalent in tropics and southern subtropics while ancylostoma is in subtropic or northern temperate zones .
worldwidely , n. americanus accounts for the predominant etiology of human hookworm infection , whereas a. duodenale occurs in more scattered focal environments ( 2 ) . until the 1970s , sths were highly prevalent in korea , and the population of infected people far outweighed those uninfected .
infections of sth were decreased , however , by a national mass control program in the 1970s to 1990s ( 3 ) .
only clonorchiasis and sporadic tissue parasitic helminthiases are recognized at present in korea ( 4 ) . among sths ,
hookworm disappeared first , and thus anemia and malnutrition by hookworm infection became negligible in korea in 1980s .
the hookworm egg positive rate in korea was 10.7% in 1971 , but decreased to 3.7% in 1978 , 0.08% in 1985 , and 0% in 2004 ( 3 , 5 ) .
of human hookworms , a. duodenale was predominant in korea but n. americanus was recognized in a few localities ( 6 - 8 ) .
the last case of n. americanus infection in korea was reported in 1978 ( 8) .
later , in 1992 , an imported case of a. duodenale was reported ( 9 ) .
herein , we describe a case of an 82-yr - old woman who suffered from severe chronic iron deficiency anemia by necator americanus infection in korea .
an 82-yr - old woman was transferred to the national police hospital , seoul , on october 22 , 2007 , complaining of shortness of breath and dizziness which lasted for years .
she lived in uljin - gun ( county ) , a remote rural area of eastern mountain of gyeongsangbuk - do , korea .
she had resided in uljin - gun throughout her entire life and had no history of overseas traveling .
, she had been treated for anemia including two transfusions in 2006 at a general hospital in seoul .
she also visited another general hospital complaining exertional dyspnea , and was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis . on physical examination at admission , she was pale , ill - looking , and undernourished , but her vital signs were stable .
laboratory results revealed overt anemia : rbc 1.6610/l ( normal 4.0 - 5.410/l ) , wbc 3.810/l ( normal 4 - 1010/l ) , hb 3.4 g / dl ( normal 12 - 16 g / dl ) , hct 12.4% ( 36 - 48% ) , mcv 74.7 fl ( normal 79 - 95 fl ) , mch 20.5 pg ( normal 27 - 33 pg ) , mchc 27.4 g / dl ( normal 32 - 36 g / dl ) , platelet count , 16210/l ( normal 130 - 40010/l ) , fe 9 g / dl ( normal 37 - 145 mg / dl ) , total iron - binding capacity 318 mg / dl ( normal 228 - 428 mg / dl ) , ferritin 10 ng / ml ( normal 10 - 130 ng / ml ) , neutrophils 56% , lymphocytes 25% , monocytes 11% , and eosinophils 8% .
stool examination was negative for occult blood , but was not examined for parasite eggs .
other biochemistry examinations , including electrolytes , liver and renal functions were within normal limits .
serum elisa against tissue invading helminthiases was negative for clonorchis , paragonimus , cysticercus , and sparganum .

to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of hbov , we investigated the presence of this virus in children with respiratory tract infection in our region ( gipuzkoa , basque country , spain ) . among the first patients in whom hbov was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates , we found two 12-month - old children with diarrhea in addition to respiratory symptoms . because animal parvoviruses are frequently associated with enteritis in young animals ( 6 ) , we investigated the presence of hbov in the diarrheal feces of both children .
hbov was detected in both samples , and no other intestinal pathogens were identified . to rule out the possibility that this result could have been due to fecal contamination
resulting from swallowing respiratory secretions , and to determine whether the gastrointestinal tract is affected by this new respiratory virus , we studied its presence in patient feces in 527 episodes of acute gastroenteritis , unrelated to respiratory infection , in children  ⁇ 3 years of age , mainly from nonhospital centers ( ambulatory clinics ) .
viral dna and rna were obtained from nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool specimens with an automatic extractor biorobot m48 ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) by using the magattract virus mini m48 kit ( qiagen ) .
cdna was obtained by using m - mulv reverse transcriptase ( promega , madison , wi , usa ) and random primers .
aliquots of the dna and cdna were frozen at 40c until pcr for hbov detection was performed .
respiratory samples were investigated for respiratory syncytial virus , influenza viruses a and b , parainfluenza virus types 14 , and adenovirus by cell culture and pcr .
rhinovirus , coronavirus ( nl63 coronavirus included ) , and metapneumovirus were studied by pcr alone .
yersinia enterocolitica , campylobacter spp . , and enteroinvasive escherichia coli o157 by standard culture methods .
hbov detection was performed by pcr with primers derived from the np1 gene ( 1 ) .
positive samples were retested and confirmed as positive by using a second pcr assay with primers derived from another location in the hbov genome ( vp1 gene ) ( 7 ) . amplified np1 and vp1 gene fragments ( 354 bp and 403 bp , respectively ) were sequenced and analyzed by using the blast software ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast ) .
each pcr run included a negative control ( water ) that was treated as the clinical sample throughout , and pcr was performed with the usual precautions to avoid contamination .
of the 527 stool samples analyzed from december 2005 through march 2006 , hbov was detected in 48 ( 9.1% ) . from a second group of 520 children
 ⁇ 3 years of age who came to the pediatric emergency unit of our hospital with an episode of acute respiratory infection during the same period , a similar frequency of hbov detection was obtained ( 40/520 , 7.7% ) when nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested .
analysis of np1 and vp1 partial gene sequences obtained from all fecal and respiratory hbov - positive samples showed a similarity of > 95% with previously published hbov sequences . of 40 hbov - positive respiratory samples , 25 ( 62.5% ) showed coinfection with other viruses ( respiratory syncytial virus in 13 , rhinovirus in 3 , influenza a in 3 , coronavirus oc43 in 2 , adenovirus in 1 , influenza b in 1 , respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus oc43 in 1 , and influenza a and rhinovirus in 1 ) .
of the 48 hbov - positive fecal samples , 28 ( 58.3% ) showed coinfection with another intestinal pathogen ( salmonella enteritidis in 1 , campylobacter jejuni in 5 , rotavirus in 14 , norovirus in 7 , and c. jejuni and norovirus in 1 ) . in this study , simultaneous detection of hbov and
the incidence of coinfection in respiratory illness was similar to that observed in studies that were not limited to specimens that had already tested negative for other microorganisms and in which a wide number of agents were investigated ( 4 ) .

multicystic dysplastic kidney ( mcdk ) , a variant of renal dysplasia , is one of the most frequently identified congenital urinary tract abnormalities ( cakut ) .
its incidence varies , depending on the study and country , but ranges from 1 in 3640 to 1 in 4300 live births [ 1 , 2 ] .
renal dysplasia is characterized by structural disorganization of the renal tissue , involving undifferentiated epithelium and primitive ducts surrounded by fibromuscular connective tissue .
although mcdk can be an isolated finding , it is often associated with other cakut .
additionally , this condition has also been described in association with other multisystemic disorders of known genetic etiologies .
most mcdks undergo involution within the first years of life ; nevertheless , a continuous follow - up should be performed not only to identify other urologic abnormalities , but also because hypertension and abnormal renal function have been reported [ 57 ] .
cowden disease ( cd , mim 158350 ) is an autosomal - dominant condition with variable expression that results most commonly ( 80% ) from a mutation in the pten gene on chromosome 10q .
it is characterized by multiple hamartomatous neoplasms of the skin and mucosa , gastrointestinal tract , bones , central nervous system , eyes and genitourinary tract .
this disease is associated with the development of several types of malignancies during the adult life , making recognition of individuals with this condition important .
we report a 7-year - old male patient with antenatal diagnosis of unilateral mcdk and recently identified cd an unknown association and discuss its approach as well as the obligatory multidisciplinary follow - up in the future .
a 7-year - old male patient with no relevant family history had a prenatal diagnosis of probable unilateral mcdk and macrocephaly .
renal ultrasound examination at 30 weeks gestation showed a small right kidney ( 24 mm ) , globally hyperechogenic with multiple cysts of variable size .
after birth , isolated macrocephaly ( 95th percentile ) was confirmed without other abnormalities at physical examination .
renal ultrasound at 2 and 15 days of life confirmed a small right dysplastic kidney ( 35 mm ) together with a normal , non - dilated and well - differentiated left kidney ( 52 mm ) .
a voiding cystourethrography showed bilateral vesicoureteric reflux ( right grade 4 and left grade 3 ) .
the rest of the neonatal period was uneventful . during infancy , the patient had normal weight and stature growth ( 50th percentile ) but notable macrocephaly ( > 97th percentile ) with prominent forehead and small jaw .
psychomotor development was slightly delayed ( walking at 20 months ) and mild mental retardation was established . both karyotype analysis and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging
a renal ultrasound showed progressive right dysplastic kidney involution but still detectable by 7 years of age .
macrocephaly and psychomotor delay were suggestive of cd and prompted us to perform mutation screening of the pten gene .
the emergence of a nodular lesion ( 6 mm ) above the right eyebrow ( histological analysis confirmed a leiomyoma ) and a slightly squamous appearance of the lower lip were convincing additional evidence for cd . a single nucleotide substitution ( c.210 - 14a > g ) within intron 3 of the pten gene created a new acceptor - splicing site 13 nucleotides upstream of exon 4 .
this frameshift variant creates a premature stop codon , predicted to result in the synthesis of a truncated pten protein , therefore probably not functional .
this mutation occurred de novo since it was absent in both parents ' dna extracted from blood leucocytes .
multicystic dysplastic kidney is characterized by the presence of multiple , non - communicating cysts of various sizes separated by dysplastic parenchyma and the absence of a normal pelvicaliceal system .
mutations in genes , such as eya1 , six1 , tcf2 and pax2 , which are known to have important roles in ureteric bud development , have been identified in multiple syndromes with renal dysplasia , including mcdk .
indeed both branchio - oto - renal syndrome ( mutations in eya1 or six1 ) and renal - coloboma syndrome ( mutations in pax2 gene ) result in dysplastic kidneys 
mcdk has also been reported in other syndromes , including alagille syndrome ( mutations in the jag1 gene ) , beckwith

an estimated 10 million us adults have peripheral artery disease ( pad ) , a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis that has been linked to reduced functional capacity and increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .
preventable or treatable risk factors in the initiation and development of pad include cigarette smoking , type 2 diabetes , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia , which together may account for 75% of the excess pad risk .
besides these traditional risk factors , kidney function has also been associated with incident pad risk in a number of studies and is recognized as a pad risk factor .
the clinical standard for the assessment of kidney function is the creatininebased estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) .
however , creatinine ( molecular weight of 113 da ) is a byproduct of muscle breakdown and tends to overestimate the egfr in individuals with lower creatinine generation due to loss of muscle mass ( such as those with pad ) .
in addition , renal tubules actively secrete creatinine , further reducing the value of creatinine to estimate gfr . both 2microglobulin , a subunit of the major histocompatibility class i complex , and cystatin c , a cysteine protease inhibitor , have been proposed as alternative markers for the detection of renal impairment . owing to their relatively low molecular weight compared with , for example , albumin ( 66 kda ) , 2microglobulin ( 12 kda ) and cystatin c ( 13 kda ) pass freely through the glomerular filtration barrier .
furthermore , these filtration markers are produced at a relatively constant rate and are neither affected by muscle mass nor subject to tubular secretion . in previous observational studies , both cystatin c and 2microglobulin have been shown to predict cardiovascular events and mortality more strongly than creatinine .
however , evidence for an association between cystatin c and future risk of pad is sparse and conflicting . also ,
although circulating 2microglobulin has previously been identified as a factor strongly linked to the presence and severity of pad in crosssectional studies , there are no studies that have prospectively examined this association .
we , therefore , investigated the associations between 3 markers of kidney function ( ie , 2microglobulin , cystatin c , and creatinine ) with future risk of the development of pad in 2 large and wellcharacterized cohorts of men and women .
the nurses health study ( nhs ) is a prospective cohort study of 121 701 female nurses aged 30 to 55 years at recruitment in 1976 .
the health professionals followup study ( hpfs ) is a prospective cohort study of 51 529 male dentists , optometrists , pharmacists , podiatrists , osteopathic physicians , and veterinarians aged 40 to 75 years at recruitment in 1986 . of these individuals ,
32 826 women provided a blood sample in 1990 and 18 224 men provided blood specimens in 1994 .
we excluded individuals who had a history of cardiovascular disease , including myocardial infarction ; surgical / percutaneous revascularization of the coronary , carotid , or peripheral beds ; confirmed pad ; stroke ; and transient ischemic attack .
the casecontrol analytic datasets include all incident symptomatic pad cases , for a total of 144 cases and 432 controls in the nhs and 143 cases and 429 controls in the hpfs .
controls were matched 3:1 to cases on age , race , smoking history , month of blood draw ( within 3 months ) , and fasting status , following the nested casecontrol design described by prentice and breslow .
we selected controls at random , conditional on the matching factors , from participants free of cardiovascular diseases at the time the incident case occurred ( risk set sampling ) .
we restricted all cases and controls to those free of cardiovascular diseases at baseline to ensure identification of only incident cases .
this included angina , myocardial infarction , surgical / percutaneous revascularization of the coronary , carotid , or peripheral beds , claudication , stroke , and transient ischemic attack , which are all assessed biennially .
because older age categories had fewer participants , we relaxed the age match range yearbyyear if necessary to a maximum of within 3 years .

angiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels by sprouting of pre - existing ones , is a main mechanism of vascularization during embryonic development , growth , formation of the corpus luteum and endometrium , regeneration and wound healing .
however , deregulated , abnormal angiogenesis is involved in many pathological processes [ 1 , 2 ] .
the complex sequence of events involved in angiogenesis is related to changes in endothelial cell biosignalling .
the relationships of angiogenesis with cancer have special relevance , since angiogenesis has been described as one of the hallmarks of cancer , playing an essential role in tumour growth , invasion , and metastasis .
since tumour blood vessels show many differences from normal vessels and are not genetically unstable , they are potential targets for therapy of all types of cancer . due to the pivotal role played by endothelial cells in tumour angiogenesis ,
most previous efforts were devoted to the development of agents that could block their activation by an angiogenic signal ( mainly vegf ) , or to inhibit one or several specific functions of activated endothelial cells ( proliferation , adhesion to extracellular matrix , proteolytic activities , migration , invasion or differentiation ) .
national cancer institute database showed that in august 1999 a total of 20 angiogenesis inhibitors were being tested in clinical trials . remarkably , most of them were monotherapies with the antiangiogenic agent , and those compounds that had then reached the phase iii , including several inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases , were discontinued due to their lack of activity or the appearance of undesirable toxicities . in spite of the great number of angiogenesis inhibitors described so far ( estimated to be > 300 drug candidates in 2001 ) , and the interesting results obtained in experimental models , even showing complete tumour regressions in pre - clinical studies , modest or even negative results emerged from the first generation of compounds entered in clinical trials .
nevertheless , there is no reason for premature pessimism , as revealed by current ongoing trials and the clinical developmental status of anti - angiogenic drugs .
a critical analysis of the disappointing results obtained in previous clinical trials points to different reasons for this failure .
these include flaws in the methods used to select these inhibitors and in the design of the clinical trials to test their effects , as well as an oversimplified view of tumour vasculature pathophysiology .
angiogenesis inhibitors are initially selected by means of in vitro assays that make use of endothelial cells from different sources .
the results obtained in this primary screening can be dependent on the type of endothelial cell .
afterwards , the antiangiogenic activity of the selected compounds is usually tested with several in vivo assays ( for a review , see ) .
although useful , these have limitations . some of them do not take into account the tumour microenvi ronment ( this is the case of vascularization assays in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane and in the mouse cornea ) .
other assays make use of rapidly growing tumours and/or animals that do not fit into the clinical reality .
most of the tumour systems used with laboratory animals show angiogenic responses much higher than those induced by human tumours .
furthermore , the effectiveness of an angiogenesis inhibitor can be hampered by the intrinsic heterogeneity of human tumour angiogenesis .
animal and preliminary clinical trials have revealed that different tumours respond very differently to antiangiogenic therapy .
in fact , the responses have been extremely heterogeneous , most probably due to the randomized design of the trials .
a clinical challenge in antiangiogenesis is the finding of biological markers that help to identify subsets of patients more likely to respond to a given antiangiogenic therapy , as well as to determine optimal dosing of therapy , to detect early clinical benefit or emerging resistances and to decide whether to change therapy in second - line treatments .
, microvessel density has been proven to be a useful prognostic indicator but , at the same time , does not seem to be a good direct indicator of antiangiogenic treatment efficacy .
surrogate biomarkers could include those related to the various steps of the angiogenic process , including variations in endothelial - cell survival , alterations in the endothelial - cell signaling , and variations in the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells [ 3 , 13 , 15 , 16 ] .
another possibilityis the fractal analysis of the vascular network in tumour biopsies . however , these approaches are far from an ideal biomarker for clinical practice .
although some authors consider taking biopsies repeatedly to be feasible , most physicians consider this to be very cumbersome for patients .
since tumour angiogenesis produces interstitial hypertension in tumours , the determination of interstitial pressure of tumours can be considered an alternative surrogate biomarker .
easier to determine and less invasive approaches include the measurements of circulating levels of several

this retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital ( 2014 - 09 - 037 ) . between november 2011 and october 2014 ,
245 patients in the icu underwent bedside pdt with a ciaglia blue rhino percutaneous tracheostomy set ( cook medical , bloomington , in , usa ) due to prolonged endotracheal tube insertion .
pdt was not performed in patients aged under 18 years , those with any pulsation palpated over the tracheostomy site , patients with a history of surgery or radiotherapy in the cervical region , and those with coagulopathy ( increased prothrombin time , inr > 2 ) .
the first four procedures were performed by two physicians and one nurse using the standard technique , with one physician operating the bronchoscope while the other performed pdt .
the next 55 procedures were performed by one physician and one nurse , with the physician using the bronchoscope only to confirm and evaluate the proper depth for the endotracheal tube before performing pdt using the simplified method described below .
the remaining 186 procedures were performed using the simplified technique after repositioning the endotracheal tube at the predetermined depth ( 17 cm for males and 15 cm for females at the incisor ) .
all pdts were performed by a single physician and one nurse , both of whom fully understood the entire procedure .
the nurse administered sedatives and analgesics , as well as repositioning the endotracheal tube . except for patients with limited neck extension ,
a small pillow was placed under the patient 's shoulders to slightly extend the neck .
transverse markings were made at the cricothyroid membrane and 2.0 cm toward the sternal notch ( fig .
was also made in the midline of the trachea by holding the trachea between the thumb and index finger . the middle of the vertical mark intersected with the transverse mark 2.0 cm below the cricothyroid membrane ( fig .
if the cricothyroid membrane could not be palpated , ultrasonography was used to identify the anatomic structures .
the cricoid cartilage and tracheal rings were identified by placing the linear probe 45 degrees from the sagittal plane , and the area between the second and third tracheal rings was marked with a skin marker ( figs .
the linear probe was positioned vertical to the trachea to confirm its midline ( figs .
fio2 was increased to 1.0 , and 57 cmh2o positive end - expiratory pressure was applied to all patients receiving ventilator care . in patients who were receiving oxygen supplementation via a hydro - trach t - piece ,
the pdt site was disinfected with povidone iodine solution and a sterile drape was used before subcutaneously injecting 2% lidocaine .
a vertical skin incision ( 1.5 cm ) was made through the midline vertical marking , and the endotracheal tube was withdrawn until the tube depth was 17 cm for males and 15 cm for females ( fig .
1d ) using a 5 cm - introducer needle , included in the cook ciaglia blue rhino set , and proper needle position was confirmed by air regurgitation with a syringe containing normal saline .
the remaining pdt procedure was performed using the previous standard method with a # 7 tracheostomy tube ( twist , tracoe , germany ) .
a # 8 tube was used only in patients in whom bronchoscopic lavage was planned ( about 10 patients ) .
however , all 3 patients were receiving either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy and had an abnormal coagulation status . bleeding in all three
long - term ( > 7 days ) follow - up in 150 patients showed no late complications and no deaths related to pdt .
although use of a fob during pdt has been recommended for precise positioning and to avoid complications , bronchoscopy itself can cause complications . also , an additional physician is required and additional costs may result from damage to the fob .
thus , several studies have assessed the safety of pdt without a fob , including technical modifications and simplified procedures .
direct visualization of the larynx with a laryngoscope confirmed adequate endotracheal tube repositioning depth prior to pdt , while direct or indirect palpation of the trachea confirmed the proper tracheostomy site .
although these simplified techniques have been shown to be safe , they have not been widely adopted .
this study assessed the safety of a simplified pdt technique using the ciaglia blue rhino , by repositioning the existing endotracheal tube at a pre - determined depth and determining proper pdt site by superficial palpation .
early complications of pdt include loss of airway , bleeding , conversion to open

the use of bleaching materials both hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide has become an attractive procedure in the dental clinic .
furthermore , the use of fluoride - releasing glass ionomer as a dental restorative material has also become popular .
the situation where these materials interact within the oral cavity during the bleaching process can occur frequently ; thus , understanding their reaction is important .
the bleaching process is believed to occur through oxidation by hydroxyl radicals that are generated from the bleaching agent . with clinically favorable and safe aspects for patients ,
several studies have shown the effectiveness of bleaching agents on dental restorative materials and teeth with regard to surface hardness , or other modifications . during setting of glass ionomer ,
fluoride ions are produced from strong soluble aluminofluoride complexes like alf . when a fully set glass ionomer is exposed to neutral aqueous solutions , it absorbs water and releases ions such as sodium , silica , calcium , and fluoride .
two processes occur during fluoride release : a fast elution process during the early periods , and a long - term diffusive process .
it is also influenced by experimental factors , i.e. , storage media , frequency of change of the storage solution , composition and ph - value of saliva , plaque , and pellicle formation . in vitro ,
fluoride release increases in acidic media ; this was explained by the fact that decreasing ph increases the dissolution of the material leading to a higher fluoride level in acidic immersion .
thereby , the proportion of free fluoride to bound fluoride was higher under acidic than under neutral conditions . when hydrogen peroxide is stored , an acidic ph must be maintained to extend the shelf life .
they found that at home bleaching products have a ph range from 5.66 to 7.3 .
while they found ph of in - office bleaching system were lower and ranged from 3.6 to 6.5 .
when hydrogen peroxide interacts with dental materials , it decomposes to form hydroxyl radical intermediates and finally to form water and oxygen . also , carbamide peroxide will dissociate to h2o2 , co2 , urea and nh3 , and then h2o2 will decompose again to water and oxygen finally . those chemical ingredients may affect the fluoride release of glass ionomer restoratives .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of vital bleaching on the fluoride release of various types of glass ionomer restorations . also , to compare the fluoride release of various types of glass ionomer restorations .
two vital bleaching commercial products and three types of glass ionomer restorative materials were selected for this study .
bleaching materials used were opalescence xtra boost ( 38%hydrogen peroxide with ph of 7 ) and opalescence quick ( 35%carbamide peroxide with ph of 6 ) both manufactured by ultradent ( inc .
glass ionomer materials used were ketac fil ( conventional glass ionomer ) , photac fil ( resin modified glass ionomer ) , and f2000 ( poly acid modified composite resin ) manufactured by 3 m ( espe , st paul , usa ) .
thirty disk shaped specimens ( 5 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness ) were prepared for each brand of glass ionomer .
the mold was sandwiched between two glass plates to allow setting of glass ionomer under pressure .
capsules of ketac fil were activated then triturated according to manufacturer instructions for 15 s , injected in the holes of the mold in one increment .
the mold was filled to slight excess , the specimen 's top surface was covered by a mylar strip and a glass slide was secured to flatten the surface and pressed with standard load 500 mg over the mold then left for setting .
capsules of both photac fil and f2000 were triturated according to manufacturer instructions for 15 s and injected into holes , covered with glass slide , and light cured for 40 s per each side using a light source ( pencure , j morita mfg corp . ,
each disk specimen was removed from the mold by separating its two halves and placed in a numerated plastic tube containing 5 ml of distilled water , tightly sealed with a cap .
the specimens were incubated at 37c during the whole experimental period ( 3 months ) . after 24 h
each group was further subdivided into three sub - groups , 10 samples for each group .
the first sub group was a control group , the second sub group was bleached with opalescence xtra ( ox ) , and the last one was bleached with opalescence quick ( oq ) .
second and third subgroups were bleached with the two bleaching agents ox and oq according to their manufacturer instructions , every sample was covered

endoscopic techniques that allow visualization of the airways of patients with pulmonary maladies have become a mainstay of medical treatment . since the invention of the rigid bronchoscope in 1897 by gustav killian , along with its refinement by chevalier jackson in the early 20 century , and shigeto ikeda 's introduction of the flexible bronchoscope in 1967 ;
these instruments have become important clinical assets in the armamentarium of surgeons , intensivists , and pulmonologists .
bronchoscopy , both fiberoptic and rigid , encompasses a number of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques to visualize the luminal surface of the trachea and proximal airways .
flexible or fiberoptic bronchoscopy , allows for excellent visualization of the airway lumen and luminal surface including segmental and subsegmental bronchi with a relatively less traumatic instrument ; rigid bronchoscopy enables more therapeutic options but is limited to the trachea and main bronchi unless combined with a fiberoptic bronchoscope .
bronchoscopy has become an important tool not only for visualizing abnormalities , but also for biopsy / tissue sampling , removal of secretions , mucous plugs , clots , and foreign bodies .
more recent advances include stent placement for relief of airway compression , laser applications ( tumor resection ) , curtailing hemorrhage ( using cryocoagulation / cryotherapy ) , assisting in the placement of percutaneous tracheostomies , and securing the airway through facilitation of endotracheal tube placement .
traditionally , complications of bronchoscopy were labeled minor , major / severe , or fatal .
we discuss complications of both flexible and rigid bronchoscopy , categorizing them as mechanical or systemic for improved clarity .
since its introduction in the 1960s , published rates of complication from fiberoptic bronchoscopy have ranged from  ⁇  0.1 to 11% , with mortality generally reported between 0 and 0.1% .
complications of fiberoptic bronchoscopy mechanical complications of fiberoptic bronchoscopy include oro- or nasopharyngeal , vocal cord , and airway trauma as well as bronchospasm , laryngospasm , pulmonary derecruitment / atelectasis , pneumothorax , airway hemorrhage , and introduction or exacerbation of infection . in general ,
the rates of mechanical complications have been , and continue to be , quite low .
the most consistently reported mechanical complications are related to airway manipulation / trauma and bleeding .
a number of questionnaire - based , cross - sectional studies in the 1970s examined the reported rates of complications .
a survey sent to 1,041 physicians who performed bronchoscopy reported 12 deaths in 48,000 cases , none of which were related to direct mechanical airway trauma and only two of which were associated with pneumonia ( both cases of pneumonia preceded the bronchoscopy ) .
other mechanical complications included four brushes breaking off in the bronchi , at least one of which required thoracotomy , and 52 episodes of life - threatening airway complications ( most commonly bronchospasm ) .
lindholm et al . , examined airway pressures of patients undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy and found that while spontaneously breathing patients had little change in airway pressures ( average of 5.2 cm h2o during inhalation and + 3.5 cm h2o during exhalation ) , intubated patients had a much wider range ( as low as 35 cm h2o during inhalation and higher than + 35 cm h2o during exhalation ) .
this is most likely a combination of the small cross - sectional area remaining in the endotracheal tube , while a fiberoptic bronchoscope is in place , combined with dyssynchronous breathing from the patient .
the pattern of these pressure changes leads to a decrease in vital capacity ( as tidal volume is restricted by high pressures and is lost via bronchoscopic suction ) , and a decrease in forced expiratory volume secondary to obstructed exhalation , which increases auto - positive end - expiratory pressure ( peep ) and functional residual capacity ( frc ) .
this increase in auto - peep and frc may actually protect against hypoxemia , particularly if the patient is breathing 100% oxygen , although following removal of the bronchoscope the peep and frc will decrease , at this point atelectasis , bronchospasm , and laryngospasm may all lead to post - procedural hypoxemia unless treated promptly .
prolonged suctioning during bronchoscopy can lead to further derecruitment and atelectasis , as well as worsening of post - procedural hypoxemia . despite these physiologic derangements , mechanical rates of pulmonary complications remain low with rates of pneumothorax from 0.07 to 0.16% , and respiratory failure from 0.2 to 0.31% in

the metabolic syndrome ( mets ) is a clustering of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors that have been widely discussed for at least 20 years .
although some have questioned the clinical utility of metabolic syndrome , there are many reasons to believe that this entity is useful . identification of metabolic syndrome is a simple measure of finding people with a clustering of risk factors that put them at increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) .
furthermore , such individuals need more intensive lifestyle interventions at an early stage to delay the disease progression to a still higher - risk category .
also , the identification of metabolic syndrome will attract attention to various other related conditions such as fatty liver , polycystic ovary syndrome , and obstructive sleep apnea .
since the first official definition of the metabolic syndrome put forward by a working group of the world health organization ( who ) in 1998 , a number of different definitions have been proposed .
the latest definition given by international diabetes federation ( idf ) takes into account the evidence that abdominal obesity is an important component of the metabolic syndrome and proposes gender- and race - specific cut - offs for waist circumference ( wc ) . although the need for different wc is attributed to ethnic variation , it was observed that even within the same population , people with identical wc but different heights have different risks for metabolic syndrome .
several studies from asia indicate that waist - to - height ratio ( whtr ) is more strongly associated with cvd risk factors than other anthropometric measures such as wc , body mass index ( bmi ) , and waist hip ratio ( whr ) .
the aim of our study was to perform a comparative validation of wc , bmi , whr , and whtr for defining the metabolic syndrome in indian population living in the urban and rural areas of rohtak district , haryana , india .
we used the idf definition of metabolic syndrome , excluding the measure of obesity , to determine which obesity measure among wc , bmi , whr , and whtr , and what appropriate cut - off value are most closely predictive of the non - adipose components of the idf 's definition of metabolic syndrome .
informed consent was obtained after explaining the details of the procedure to all subjects . in rural population
of these two rural blocks , 85 anganwadi centers ( awc ) were selected by the random selection method . from the population survey
register of awc , male and female patients were randomly selected and called at the awc on a specified date and time after an overnight fast . in urban areas ,
two out of total six urban health centers were selected randomly , and from the survey registers of these two health centers , male and female patients were selected randomly . a day before the study ,
all subjects were advised to observe overnight fasting ( at least 8 hours ) and called at the nearest health center / awc in the morning .
initial evaluation included detailed history and clinical examination of the subjects to exclude any systemic diseases .
anthropometric indices including height ( without shoes and socks ) , weight , wc , and hip circumference were recorded for the subjects .
height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer and weight measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using calibrated platform scales .
waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the midpoint between the subcostal margin and the margin of the supracristal plane according to the idf diagnostic criteria .
hip circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm around the thighs , at the height of the greater trochanter , with the patients in the standing position .
blood pressure was recorded after patients were made to sit and rest for at least half an hour .
blood pressure was recorded thrice at 5-minute intervals in a sitting position in the non - dominant arm , with the value to the nearest 2 mm hg , using a standard adult mercury sphygmomanometer .
patients suffering from chronic renal , pancreatic or other severe illness , pregnant women , and women who delivered 2 months or less preceding the study , patients on lipid lowering agents , steroids , nicotinic acid , or other medications likely to cause dysglycemia , were excluded from the study . in the morning after an overnight fasting period , blood samples were obtained from the antecubital vein and transfused into vacuum tubes containing edta .
all patients were allowed to sit and rest for at least half an hour before the blood samples were taken .
plasma glucose , total cholesterol , triglycerides , and hdl - cholesterol were measured . according to the idf definition for the indian population , for an individual to be defined as having the

periodontitis ( pd ) is a chronic inflammatory disease where resident cells and preformed mediators induce leukocyte infiltration and progressive destruction of the tooth supporting tissues as a result of interaction between bacterial products , cell populations , and mediators in disease - susceptible individuals [ 1 , 2 ] .
this is also influenced by genetic and environmental risk factors and is characterized as a complex disease with multifactorial etiology [ 3 , 4 ] . in this context , environmental factors , including oral hygiene / bacterial plaque , smoking , and stress , play an important role in the expression of pd .
furthermore , it has been evidenced by some authors that there is a joint influence of polymorphisms in multiple genes , such as the genes of il-10 and il-6 .
polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( pmns ) represent the first line of defense to protect the host from periodontal pathogens in the gingival sulcus and junctional epithelium .
pmns are a critical arm of defense against periodontitis , but bacterial evasion of the neutrophil microbicidal machinery coupled with delayed neutrophil apoptosis may transform the neutrophil from defender to perpetrator .
actually , these cells can release a variety of factors , such as reactive oxygen species , collagenases , and other proteases , [ 1 , 9 ] , such as stimulation from a wide range of cytokines . in this scenario
, macrophages can act as antigen - presenting cells , promoting the activation of lymphocytes .
therefore , the cellular concentration of neutrophils in the inflammatory infiltrates decreases during the transition between gingivitis and periodontitis , in which there is a predominance of lymphocytes .
it has been described that proinflammatory cytokines , prostaglandin e2 , matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) , nitric oxide ( no ) , and other inflammatory mediators play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pd [ 1012 ] . moreover ,
an increase of tnf- , il-1 , il-6 , il-11 , and il-17 can induce osteoclastogenesis by increasing the expression of receptor activator of nf-b ligand ( rankl ) and by reducing the osteoprotegerin ( opg ) production in osteoblasts and stromal cells .
in fact , it was demonstrated that il-17 and rankl were overregulated and il-10 , an anti - inflammatory cytokine , and tgf-1 were downregulated in active periodontal lesions compared with inactive lesions [ 14 , 15 ] ( figure 1(a ) ) . considering that an imbalance between bone formation and resorption is also linked to various diseases
, studies suggest that pd may be a risk factor for other diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , but without consensus .
although pathogenesis of ra is not completely understood , it is recognized that the activation of the complement system is important in disease development , the abnormal response of circulating lymphocytes from patients , and an alteration in the structure of these cells , which contribute to the autoimmunity , immunosuppression , and the genesis of the disease .
studies report there is a correlation between both pd and ra since the mechanisms for the development of ra have consonance with the pathogenesis of chronic pd . in fact
, ra is defined as an inflammatory and autoimmune disease characterized by accumulation of leukocyte inflammatory infiltrate in the synovial membrane , as well as mediators such as pge2 , tnf- , il-1 , il-6 , il-12 , il-17 , il-18 , il-33 , granulocyte macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( gm - csf ) , monocyte colony - stimulating factor ( m - csf ) , rankl , mmps , and no , all being found in the synovial fluid [ 2024 ] , and leading to synovitis and joint architecture destruction .
some studies have suggested that the susceptibility of ra may be associated with genetic or environmental factors .
one of the most important genetic factors is the human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) class ii .
certain alleles of this antigen are often associated with the development of rheumatoid arthritis ( hla - drb10101 , hla - drb10102 , hla - drb10401 , hla - drb10404 , hla - drb10405 , hla - drb10408 , hla - drb10410 , hla - drb11001 , and hla - drb11402 ) .
other factors include the allele of 620w of ptpn22 ( protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 ) , a gene encoding tyrosine phosphatase that is involved in controlling the intracellular signaling triggered through

prostate cancer ( pca ) is the second most common neoplasia in men worldwide , and the sixth cause of cancer - specific death worldwide . in the last 20 years
, there has been a progressive increase in the global incidence of this disease . in asian countries ,
the incidence and mortality of pca are low and are reported to be about 1/8 of that in western countries .
however , some epidemiological investigations suggest the incidence of pca in asian men who migrant to the usa rapidly approaches that in western men within two generations .
interestingly , asian - american men retaining at least one genetic or lifestyle characteristic of asian residents make their risk of pca less than that of white residents of the usa .
recent studies have reported that asian men consume large quantities of isoflavones - based foods .
by contrast , western diets mainly comprise red meat - based foods with bare isoflavones .
isoflavone is one of the phytoestrogens with similar molecular structures to animal estrogen and has weak estrogenic effects .
the major isoflavones include genistin , daidzin , glycitin , equol , and biochanin a and , in particular , genistein is the most widely investigated isoflavon [ figure 1 ] .
isoflavones are highly concentrated in soy products such as beans and tofu . a food frequency questionnaire used in the japan collaborative cohort study ( jacc study ) for the evaluation of cancer risk sponsored by the ministry of education , science
, sports and culture of japan ( monbusho ) in 2005 showed that serum levels of genistein and daidzein are significantly associated with the dietary intake of tofu , and slightly associated with the intake of miso soup while the consumption of fat , meat , and coffee may be associated with equol production from genistein and daidzein by intestinal microflora in this sample set .
the average daily intake of genistein in the oriental population is 2080 mg / d compared with 13 mg / d in the usa . in addition , soy consumption is different across europe .
nmol / l in a region with many vegetarians are much higher than mean levels of 2.622.6
pca is a hormone - dependent malignancy that develops from an androgen - dependent tissue that contains androgen receptors ( ars ) .
further in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that estrogens may be implicated as potential agents in the development and progression of pca .
this was supported by current epidemiological evidence showing that the higher incidence of pca among african - american men is partly due to in utero exposure to maternal estrogens since african - american women have higher circulating estrogen concentrations during pregnancy than caucasian women .
in addition , estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin ( shbg ) have been found to be higher in african - american men .
moreover , the correlation of increasing estrogen levels with the high incidence of pca was observed in african - american men .
estrogen may contribute to pca through multiple mechanisms involving estrogen receptor ( er)-mediated actions , estrogenic imprinting , epigenetic modifications , direct genotoxicity , hyperprolactinemia , and inflammation and immunologic changes .
a growing body of epidemiological studies has revealed that the incidence of pca is reduced in population with food rich in isoflavones .
many studies have demonstrated that isoflavones exert hormone - like effects and nonhormone - like effects involving inhibiting tyrosine kinases , modulation of cell proliferation , regulation of cell cycle , apoptosis , angiogenesis , and tumor cell metastasis , and our recent study found isoflavones induced autophagy cell death by up - regulation of ulk1 level , especially increasing evidence has indicated that isoflavones may be protective against the development of pca .
the main mechanisms involve binding competitively er- and er- , regulation of sex steroid hormonal synthesis and secretion , down - regulation of ar gene expression , and inhibition of prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) secretion .
these possible mechanisms include antioxidant defense , dna repair , inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis , potentiation of radio- and chemo - therapeutic agents , and antagonism of estrogen- and androgen - mediated signaling pathways .
in addition , other cells in the cancer milieu , such as the fibroblastic stromal cells , endothelial cells , and immune cells , may be targeted by soy isoflavones , which may contribute to soy - mediated pca prevention .
many randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) about the role of isoflavones in men with pca have been developed ; however , these results are inconsistent . in this

medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric brain tumor , with an incidence of  ⁇ 0.5/100,000 children  ⁇  15 years old ( 1 ) .
it is classified as grade iv according to the world health organization ( who ) ( 2 ) .
current treatment consisting of surgery , radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy has a limited role in improving the prognosis of patients ( 3,4 ) . novel therapeutic methods based on the specific mechanism of medulloblastoma carcinogenesis
an increasing number of studies have revealed that micrornas ( mirnas / mirs ) serve a role in tumorigenesis ( 59 ) .
gene expression is regulated by thousands of known mirnas , which bind to imperfect complementary sites within the 3 untranslated regions of their target protein - coding mrnas , and repressing the expression of these genes at the level of mrna stability and translation ( 10 ) .
previous research has revealed that mirnas are involved in the regulation of the majority of physiological and pathological process , including development , life span , and metabolism , and their dysregulation contributes to a number of types of disease , notably cancer ( 11 ) .
these small rnas may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors by modulating the levels of critical proteins , and their relevance in human disease and therapy is currently under investigation ( 12 ) .
an increasing number of studies have demonstrated abnormal mirna expression levels in the central nervous system ( cns ) of cancer patients , suggesting that mirnas may serve as key regulatory components in cancer of the cns ( 5,10,13 ) .
it was observed that 22 mirnas were upregulated and 26 mirnas were downregulated in the tumor tissue .
ingenuity pathway analysis ( ipa ) was used to analyze the regulatory network of the differentially expressed mirna in medulloblastoma .
it was proposed that the pathways exhibited in the network may have an important role in the tumorigenesis of medulloblastoma .
the data were downloaded from the ncbi gene expression omnibus ( geo ) database ( gse42657 , www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo ) .
the data include 7 control samples ( consisting of 3 cerebellum and 4 frontal lobe controls ) and 9 medulloblastoma samples .
the data from all samples was normalized using the limma package in r software version 3.3.0 ( https://www.r-project.org/ ) .
the selected samples of this profile are exhibited in table i. the differentially expressed genes ( degs ) were obtained with the thresholds of |logfc|>1.0 and p ⁇ 0.01 , using linear models and empirical bayes methods for assessing differential expression in microarray experiments in the limma package ( table ii ) .
a heat map of the different groups was produced to visualize the degs and cluster the corresponding groups with the differentially expressed mirnas from the tumor tissue , using the r package gplots ( fig .
the dataset ( 48 differentially expressed mirnas ) was uploaded to the ingenuity pathway analysis software version 2016 ( qiagen , inc . ,
valencia , ca , usa ) , using the microrna target filter to find the targeting information .
a total of 40 micrornas targeting 11,757 mrnas were identified by the filter . the core analysis function ( rapid assessment of the signaling and metabolic pathways , molecular networks , and biological processes that are most markedly perturbed in the dataset of interest ) to analyze the associated network functions of the mirnas .
using mirna microarray data from the geo database , 48 mirnas which are differentially expressed in medulloblastoma were identified , compared with the control group ( table ii ) .
the core analysis demonstrated the molecular network interactions and signaling pathways associated with 28 differentially expressed mirnas of medulloblastoma , and their predicted molecular targets were rebuilt using ipa . the network 
organismal injury and abnormalities , reproductive system disease , cancer had an ipa score of 41 , focusing on 17 mirna molecules , and the network cancer , organismal injury and abnormalities , cell death and survival had an ipa score of 23 , focusing on 11 mirna molecules ( fig .
the most impacted biological processes and diseases regulated by the analyzed mirnas included organismal injury and abnormalities , reproductive system disease and cancer .
the molecular network maps demonstrated that three primary components were identified to be at the central hub of the most significant network with a score of 41 ; these were tumor protein p53 ( tp53 ) , argonaute 2 ( ago2 ) and mitogen activated kinases 3 and 1 ( erk1/2 ) ( fig .

aging is a gradual process , proportional to time , that causes structural and functional 
 changes due to internal degeneration .
aging can be divided into intrinsic aging , which is natural with the 
 progression of time , and environmental aging caused by the external environment .
uv - induced photoaging is usually observed on skin that is exposed to the sun .
its clinical 
 characteristics include earlier observation than intrinsic aging , deep and wide wrinkles , 
 inconsistent pigmentation and solar lentigo on the exposed skin surface2 .
along with recent socio - financial improvements , improvements in medical technology , hygiene 
 and nutrition have increased life expectancy . as the elderly population increases ,
many 
 treatment methods to reduce skin aging and improve wrinkles and pores are currently being 
 researched4 , 5 .
however , ablative laser treatment causes a financial burden and 
 side effects , such as erythema , edema , and hyperpigmentation .
in addition , the damage on the 
 epidermis caused by ablative laser treatment delays the time between returning to daily 
 activities6,7,8 .
recently , non - ablative skin 
 rejuvenation , which improves skin aging and photoaging without damaging the epidermis , has 
 been the preferred treatment9 .
previous studies suggest that radiofrequency ( rf ) effectively reduces abdominal obesity by 
 transferring heat to the dermis , increases blood volume in the capillaries and hence 
 increases blood flow , induces collagen formation , and increases the thickness of the 
 epidermis10,11,12 .

 reported to have anti - inflammatory effects , reduce pain , reduce edema , induce healing of 
 damaged tissue or fracture , produce collagen , induce skin rejuvenation and to be effective 
 for acne and vitiligo16,17,18,19,20,21 . in this study , the effects of rf , ea , and lllt on wrinkles and moisture content were 
 investigated in 30 female subjects aged 3055 years .
the results will be used as a reference

a rapid development of medical sciences in all fields of laboratory diagnostics entails a need to improve the analytical process , which now must meet increasingly strict requirements of scientific societies that set forth new standards in diagnostics and treatment .
the most recent guidelines recommended by esc , acc , aha , and whf concerning biomarkers of myocardial necrosis also apply to the work of clinical laboratories . both good analytical quality and the time of
these 2 closely connected elements allow for obtaining a reliable result of the analysis as quickly as possible , which makes it possible for a physician to promptly perform a medical intervention .
it is particularly important in acute coronary syndrome ( acs ) , especially with persistent st - segment elevation , which might indicate coronary artery occlusion . in urgent analyses this period of time
is called turnaround time ( tat ) , measured from the moment the analysis is ordered to when a result is obtained .
this period of time consists of : taking the material ( blood ) , most often from peripheral venous vessels ; transporting it to a laboratory ; clotting and centrifugation ( if it is required by the methodology of the assay ) ; the analytical procedure itself ; and authorization and presenting the result to a physician .
esc , acc , aha , and whf guidelines state that tat should not be longer than 60 min for assays of cardiac biomarkers : cardiac isoforms of troponins t and i ( ctnt and ctni ) , mbmass isoenzyme of creatine kinase ( ck - mbmass ) , and myoglobin ( myo ) .
however , it is quite difficult to achieve this tat for assays of laboratory parameters , which just include assays of concentrations of cardiac biomarkers , with use of immunochemical methods . these assays , unlike traditional chemical assays ,
have a relatively long pre - analytical phase ( longer clotting time so as to obtain serum ) and a longer analytical procedure ( usually lasting 2040 min ) .
a way of determining troponin concentration with the high sensitivity method ( hstn ) has been a standard method in western european countries for more than a year .
thanks to this test , new possibilities have open up for cardiologists , especially in the treatment of acs in patients with no persistent st- segment elevation and in patients with coronary disease , as a predictive test . methodological modification for tests used in determining cardiac biomarkers has been in use for more than 1 year now . it reduced the time of the analytical procedure from 18 min ( the standard version of the test ) to 9 min ( the short turn - around time version of the test ) .
we should answer the question : is it possible to determine the markers of acute coronary syndrome easily , promptly , and accurately and receive reliable results ? having analyzed these observations , we decided to determine and compare the analytical quality of the tests in the standard and stat versions for determining serum level : cardiac isoform of troponin t with high sensitivity method ( tnths ) , ckmbmass , and myoglobin , as well as to verify whether the tnths stat test meets requirements for use in patients with acs .
these requirements are the following : coefficient of variation  ⁇  10% at the concentration level close to diagnostic tnths , equal to the 99 percentile of reference population ; and tat  ⁇  60 min for tnths assays , with the use of the standard and stat versions .
the study was performed with the use of roche assay kits ( tnths stat catalogue no
. 0509278190 , ckmbmass stat catalogue no . 11731432122 , and myoglobin stat catalogue no .
11820788122 ) as well as reference material for the following reagents ( tnths catalogue no . 5092744190 ; ckmbmass catalogue no . 11821598322 , and myoglobin catalogue no .
all assays were performed with a cobas e411 hitachi immunochemical analyzer , with the use of calibrators and control materials produced by roche . according to statistical metrology ,
we evaluated analytical quality by using comparative analysis of exactness ( precision and accuracy ) of measurement methods of all assay kits , as well as analyzing the correlation of the obtained results using 2 tests : the standard and stat versions . in the first module of the studies , we used standardized materials made by roche the precicontrol cardiac ii and precicontrol troponin .
we determined lege artis concentration levels of the analyzed parameters on 2 levels : diagnostic low and pathological high ( table 1 ) in test - to - test repeatability . in the second module of the studies

the association of pancreatic disease with fat necrosis at distant foci was first described by chiari in 1883 ( 1 ) .
the most common pancreatic disorders associated with pancreatic panniculitis are acute or chronic pancreatitis , especially the alcohol - related types , and pancreatic carcinoma .
other pancreatic disorders have been infrequently reported to be associated with pancreatic panniculitis , and these include post - traumatic pancreatitis , pancreatic pseudocyst , pancreas divisum , and hemophagocytic syndrome ( 2 ) . to the best of our knowledge ,
one case was associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma , and the other two were associated with acute and chronic pancreatitis , respectively ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) .
we report here on a case of pancreatic panniculitis associated with acute pancreatitis that had a fatal outcome .
physicians should be aware of this disease entity because this rare cutaneous manifestation may be associated with major morbidity and significant mortality .
a 50-yr - old man with a history of alcohol abuse presented with increasing fatigue , generalized weakness , decreased appetite , and abdominal distension and discomfort for the past 2 weeks .
he was admitted to the department of internal medicine under the impression of acute pancreatitis , and he was referred to the department of dermatology for the multiple painful subcutaneous nodules on his legs , which had suddenly developed 3 weeks before ( fig .
his hemoglobin value was 11.4 g / dl ( reference range : 13 - 18 g / dl ) , the total count of white blood cells was 31,300/l ( reference range : 4,000 - 10,000/l ) with 90.7% segment neutrophils , but the coagulation profiles and platelet counts were normal .
the serum amylase was 1,909 u / l ( reference range : 20 - 120 u / l ) , and the lipase was 2,306 u / l ( reference range : 5 - 51
u / l ) , an alanine aminotransferase level of 24 u / l ( reference range : 7 - 40
u / l ) , and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 665 u / l ( reference range : 200 - 400
the fasting glucose level was 133.9 mg / dl ( reference range of 70 - 110 mg / dl ) and the electrolytes were unbalanced .
the calcium level was 7 mg / dl ( reference range : 8.6 - 10 mg / dl ) , and the sodium level was 125
the blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 40.1 mg / dl and 2.1 mg / dl , respectively .
after 48 hr , the blood urea nitrogen was increased to 62.7 mg / dl after intravenous fluid administration .
as his leukocytosis , elevated serum ldh at admission , and hypocalcemia , hypoalbuminemia , increase in blood urea nitrogen during initial 48 hr were poor prognostic factors in ranson criteria , increased risk of complications was predicted .
the chest radiograpy showed mild pleural effusion . on the abdominal computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance ( mr ) imaging taken on the second day of admission , a swollen pancreas with an dilated pancreatic duct , a loculated fluid collection in the left anterior perirenal space , multiple hepatic cysts , and massive ascites
u / l , the serum - ascites albumin gradient was calculated to be 1.07 , and there was no evidence of malignancy .
a skin biopsy performed on the 4th day of admission from the nodule on the left lower leg showed a diffuse subcutaneous fat necrosis and ghost - like cells with thick shadowy walls and no nuclei .
there was a fine granular basophilic material deposited within and around the necrotic fat cells ( fig .
after 10 days of intensive medical care for the pancreatic disease , the patient 's condition began to worsen ; he and his family began to refuse any further treatment . despite a strong warning by physicians
the pathogenesis of pancreatic panniculitis is still unknown , but the released pancreatic enzymes such as trypsin may increase the permeability of the microcirculation .
lipase or amylase is then involved in the process of fat degradation , which results in the liberation of free fatty acids that combine with calcium to form soap ( 2 ) .
although elevation of the pancreatic enzymes is common in pancreatitis patients , pancreatic panniculitis is a very rare malady .
mullin et al . ( 5 ) identified only one case in a retrospective review of 893 patients who had suffered with pancreatic disease from various causes .
furthermore , well documented cases of fat necrosis with normal serum lipase levels have also been described ( 6 ) .
these reports , suggest that there would be some other factors that allow the pancreatic enzymes to escape from the circulation and act on the subcutaneous

point - of - care testing ( poct ) is an increasingly popular means of delivering laboratory tests close to the patient .
poct allows for rapid diagnostics and turnaround of test results to provide for faster medical decision - making and improved patient outcomes ( 1 ) .
however , if inappropriate samples are collected , specimen is mislabeled , analysis is performed incorrectly , or test is misinterpreted , wrong results may be reported and acted on by the clinician .
studies have indicated that for central laboratory testing , most errors occur in the preanalytical phase , prior to the sample arriving in the lab ( 2 )
. for poct , the majority of errors occur in the analytic phase of testing ( 3 ) .
in fact , errors can occur in any phase of laboratory testing whether performed in a central laboratory or at the point - of - care . as laboratory directors
, we should know our processes and take steps to detect and prevent errors before those mistakes reach the clinician and affect patient care . risk management is a way to reduce errors with poct .
risk management is defined as the systematic application of management policies , procedures , and practices to the tasks of analyzing , evaluating , controlling , and monitoring risk ( 4 ) .
risk is generally assumed from the patient s perspective , but risk can also apply to the operator of the poct device , the laboratory administration and even the hospital and its reputation .
risk is the chance of suffering harm or loss , and risk can be estimated through a combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm(5 ) .
errors that occur more frequently have greater risk , and errors that lead to greater harm also present greater risk .
staff troubleshoots control failures and followsup on complaints from clinicians . when errors are detected , the harm to patients is estimated and actions are taken to prevent recurrence in the future .
so , risk management is simply a formal term for many of the activities that laboratories are already doing .
quality control is a means of detecting and preventing errors . besides frequency and severity , detectability is a third factor in the risk estimation equation .
as products are constructed on a factory line , the quality of the product is inspected to ensure that it meets manufacturer specifications . if problems are noted , the line can be stopped and production corrected to ensure the quality of the final product .
these industrial risk management principles have application for reducing errors in laboratory testing as well . in the central laboratory ,
laboratories analyze liquid quality control , a stable sample with predefined acceptability ranges , in order to detect reagent problems before they affect the test result .
traditionally , liquid controls are analyzed at two concentration levels each day of testing or more frequently as required by the stability of the test system .
these are errors that affect the patient sample in the same manner as the quality control sample .
reagent degradation , calibration errors , dilution and pipetting errors are examples of systematic errors that quality control can effectively detect and prevent before the errors affect a patient result .
quality control , however , does a poor job at detecting random errors which uniquely affect individual samples .
bubbles , clots , drugs , hemolysis and other sample specific errors are not detected by liquid quality control .
other mechanisms , like bubble and clot detection , or analyzer hemolysis indices must be utilized to detect random errors .
so , analyzing two levels of liquid quality control each day of testing does not entirely eliminate risk , and laboratories have still produced bad results despite analyzing liquid quality control .
analysis of liquid quality control consumes the entire test in the process , and there is no guarantee that the next test will perform identically .
alternative control processes must be used for these devices in addition to liquid controls in order to optimize the quality of these tests .
many poct kits have built - in biologic and chemical controls to ensure the performance of individual tests .
fecal guaiac occult blood cards have a positive and negative control area on each card to ensure the reactivity of the card and developer .
urine pregnancy tests have a control line on each test to verify test storage and viability of the antibodies on the test .
drug , rapid strep , hiv and other poct unitized tests have similar control lines or regions that guarantee the quality of the test kit and result with each test .
these control lines are control processes that act as an alternative to traditional liquid controls in order to detect the risk of specific errors when using those tests . some tests , like bilirubinometers , can not even accept a liquid sample , so
how does a laboratory effectively control the quality of these tests ? it is neither economical nor possible to analyze two levels of liquid controls

therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to provide neuroprotection against ischemic injury after cardiac arrest in in vitro and in vivo models . in the previous issue of critical care , meybohm and
colleagues demonstrate that cardiac arrest triggers the release of cerebral inflammatory cytokines in pigs ' cerebral cortex .
. the combination of hypothermia with sevoflurane post - conditioning does not confer additional anti - inflammatory effects compared with hypothermia alone .
cardiac arrest remains the leading cause of death in the us and europe , with an out - of - hospital cardiac arrest survival - to - discharge rate of less than 10% . in - hospital cardiac arrest presents a dismal prognosis . according to a large in - hospital registry , the survival - to - discharge rate is 18% , whereas that of a developing country is 6.9% . without prompt care
when immediate care is available and victims are successfully resuscitated , the majority of these initial survivors subsequently suffer crippling neurologic injury or die in the few days following the cardiac arrest event .
thus , improving survival and brain function after initial resuscitation from cardiac arrest remains a critical challenge .
therapeutic hypothermia , introduced more than six decades ago , remains an important neuroprotective factor in cardiac arrest .
laboratory studies have demonstrated that cooling after resuscitation from cardiac arrest improves both survival as well as subsequent neurologic and cardiac function and has few side effects .
these findings have been reproduced using a variety of cooling techniques in different species , including rats , dogs , and pigs .
however , physician use of hypothermia induction in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest is low . in 2003 ,
abella and colleagues reported that 87% of us physicians did not use therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest .
various reasons for non - use were cited : 49% felt that there were not enough data , 32% mentioned lack of incorporation of hypothermia into advanced cardiovascular life support protocols , and 28% felt that cooling methods were technically too difficult or too slow . in 2002 , a european group demonstrated an improvement in survival - to - discharge rate with favorable neurologic status in cooled patients , compared with normothermic patients surviving after cardiac arrest ( 53% versus 35% , respectively ) , and with no significant adverse events from cooling ; thereafter , induced hypothermia was considered the best practice for patients following cardiac arrest . in 2005 , the american heart association recommended the consideration of therapeutic hypothermia for unconscious adult patients with return of spontaneous circulation following out - of - hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation . in 2008 ,
binks and colleagues reported that 85.6% of intensive care units in the uk were using hypothermia as part of post - cardiac arrest management .
clinical observation demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf ) and interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) protein were increased in cerebrospinal fluid following cardiac arrest .
animal studies showed that inflammatory markers were unregulated in rats ' hippocampus tissue and pigs ' serum and myocardial tissue after cardiac arrest [ 8 - 10 ] .
meybohm and colleagues go further to demonstrate anti - inflammatory and anti - apoptosis effects of therapeutic hypothermia via the reduction of the upregulation expression of il-1 , il-6 , il-10 , tnf and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , bcl-2 , and bax mrna and il-1 protein in cerebral cortex after cardiac arrest in a pig model .
small reductions in core temperature lead to vaso - constriction and shivering , effectively hindering hypothermia .
thus , prevention of vasoconstriction and shivering has become a major goal during induction of therapeutic hypothermia .
sevoflurane pre - conditioning and early post - conditioning reduced both cerebral infarct size and neurological defect score , reduced impairment of hippocampus long - term potentiation resulting from myocardial ischemia , and increased nuclear factor inhibitory kappabalpha content in thp-1 cells [ 11 - 13 ] .
sevoflurane pre - conditioning preserves myocardial function in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery under cardiologic arrest .
an in vivo study showed that combination hypothermia with sevoflurane attenuates the inflammatory response during endotoxemia .
however , meybohm and colleagues could not provide evidence to support the view that sevoflurane post - conditioning confers additional anti - inflammatory effects in pigs ' cerebral cortex after cardio - pulmonary resuscitation . in summary , meybohm and colleagues provide useful evidence to support the clinical use of therapeutic hypothermia for cardiac arrest , but they did not study the anti - inflammatory effects of sevoflurane in this model .
it is even possible that in the setting of clinical practice , anesthetics may not provide significant neuroprotection beyond that which is already being produced by therapeutic hypothermia .
thus , at this time , it is difficult to recommend anesthetics for the purpose of neuroprotection in cardiac arrest .

the waste arising from > 60 years of 
 civil and military nuclear 
 operations around the world contains long - lived radionuclides that 
 must be contained and isolated from future populations .
deep geological 
 disposal facilities ( gdf ) proposed by us and european waste management 
 organisations employ an engineered multibarrier approach ( figure 1 ) to retard the release of radioactive species from the waste 
 in quantities that could be detrimental to life and the environment . 

the multibarrier design concept typically combines reducing conditions 
 with high ph with the purpose of limiting the solubility and mobility 
 of radionuclide species within gdf if ( or when ) primary containment 
 fails .
general design features of the multibarrier 
 geological disposal 
 facility ( gdf ) concept proposed for the long - term ( 10 year ) storage of high - level nuclear wastes in the deep subsurface 
 ( bgl = below ground level ) .
a significant obstacle to implementation of gdf 
 is public and political 
 concern around risks and consequences of failure against design criteria 
 over the 10 to 10 year required lifespan of 
 the facility , highlighted by several failures 
 to site gdf repositories , e.g. , in the uk and 
 at yucca mountain in the usa .
should gdf 
 performance be compromised , it is possible that long - lived , mobile 
 radionuclides will be transported through the engineered backfill 
 into groundwater and pose a long - term hazard to the biosphere and 
 water resources .
thus , it is critical to the safety case for the gdf 
 not only to be able to demonstrate that the design performance is 
 well understood but to show that conditions arising from design failures 
 are also accounted for and mitigated as far as possible .
one 
 potentially problematic radionuclide is technetium-99 , a high - yield 
 fission product of u , which has a long half - life ( 2.1 
 10 years ) and high solubility in oxic conditions 
 as the pertechnetate anion [ tc(vii)o4 ] . while the conditions within the gdf are expected to be reducing , 
 such that insoluble tc(iv ) should be the dominant oxidation state , 
 the uk nuclear authority estimates suggest that a significant proportion 
 of the uk tc inventory is expected to be present as the 
 tc(vii ) pertechnetate species .
performance 
 assessment analysis of tc mobility has shown that the potential risk 
 to future populations from tc critically depends upon 
 its oxidation state , such that tc(vii ) 
 presents a significantly greater risk than tc(iv ) over the one million 
 year lifetime of the gdf , even when reducing conditions are applied . 

therefore , a robust design for the engineered barrier concept should 
 be able to account for the risk arising from the presence and behavior 
 of the mobile tc(vii ) , separately from the specific probability of 
 oxic conditions occurring or persisting within any given gdf scenario . 

an improved understanding of the behavior of pertechnetate in proposed 
 barrier materials is also necessary to evaluate the potential of different 
 design specifications to mitigate or remove the potential hazard .
understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of geochemistry 
 within and surrounding a gdf is essential in this task .
the importance 
 of ( bio)geochemical gradients on radionuclide mobility is the focus 
 of substantial current research , e.g. , refs ( 911 ) .
such studies ideally require noninvasive , nondestructive 
 measurement of the distribution , migration , and chemical transformation 
 of radionuclides within a physical model of the barrier material . 

this should be considered over time as internal conditions respond 
 to controlled changes in boundary conditions .
quantitative imaging 
 techniques offer a means of achieving this 
 information and have been developed to study reactive transport in 
 porous media for a range of materials .
imaging techniques include 
 visible light transmission and fluorescence imaging , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , and x - ray computed tomography 
 ( see ref ( 14 ) for a 
 recent review ) .
gamma attenuation techniques with external americium-241 
 or cesium-137 sources have been used to determine fluid transported 
 within a column . a key methodological 
 step remains : the extraction of quantitative geochemical information 
 from image data , particularly in three dimensions and opaque materials .
techniques have been developed to quantify ,

, it must develop tolerance to paternal antigens to avoid a lethal immunologic attack against the fetus . on the other hand
, it must preserve the ability to fight infections from a multitude of commensal and environmental pathogens .
disruption of this balance can have devastating consequences , including preterm labor and death of the fetus and/or mother .
the normal maternal immune response to pregnancy is increasingly recognized as a dynamic process , with changes in the maternal pro / anti - inflammatory profile occurring at different stages of gestation [ 13 ] . despite this recognition , a complete , longitudinal immunologic profile of normal
such analyses are critical for understanding the response to specific infectious and immunologic diseases that show disproportionately negative outcomes during pregnancy , such as influenza and ulcerative colitis .
one approach to such immune profiling is through the use of multiplex cytokine arrays , allowing for simultaneous quantification of many proteins with a very small amount of plasma or serum .
others have used multiplex arrays to study the maternal cytokine milieu , but the studies have been predominantly limited time point cross - sectional [ 68 ] or case - control [ 911 ] in design .
the results of some longitudinal studies have been published in recent years , although results have been based on relatively few time points ( 5 or fewer ) [ 13 ] . in this study
, we applied the multiplex array approach to evaluate the changes in 42 cytokines in rich detail during pregnancy .
the samples are from a cohort of 16 pregnant women , with each subject sampled a median of 18 times . because this represents a significant increase in the number of tests per subject compared to previous studies
, we also describe a strategy addressing within - subject correlation with repeated measurements using unconditional growth modeling . with this approach
, we have been able to detail the typical longitudinal variation of serum cytokines throughout pregnancy in this cohort of women .
each participant had a serum sample collected and cryopreserved biweekly from study enrollment during the first trimester ( average of 9.7 weeks ' gestation for first samples ) until 34 weeks ' gestation , then weekly from 34 weeks until delivery .
as a result of this repeated sampling , a median of 18 samples per participant were obtained longitudinally throughout pregnancy .
samples were collected under a protocol approved by the mayo clinic institutional review board ( irb ) that accrued participants from 1987 to 1988 .
information regarding date of the blood draw , date of delivery , outcome of the delivery , and any major complications that the woman experienced during pregnancy ( hypertensive disorders , preterm labor , and infections ) was available and helped identify appropriate participants to include .
only women who carried their pregnancies to term and experienced no pregnancy complications were included in this study .
we only used samples from subjects who had specimens obtained throughout the entire course of pregnancy and whose complete , longitudinally collected specimens appeared intact and nondesiccated .
most cytokines are stable in storage at 80 degrees c for up to 2 years , but stability beyond that time is not well known . therefore , before proceeding with studies on the samples of interest , we first tested protein levels of a small number of individually stored serum aliquots from other subjects archived on this protocol . since we found detectable levels of cytokines in the pregnant serum samples that were within range of control samples , we proceeded with the entire study involving a cohort of 16 healthy , primigravid women who completed a term pregnancy without any significant complications .
samples were assayed when freshly thawed to avoid freeze - thaw cycles , which are known to degrade cytokines .
contemporary plasma samples from 11 nonpregnant control subjects were collected under a separate irb - approved protocol for collection of biospecimens from healthy individuals within the same health system in 2010 and similarly assessed on the same 96-well plates for comparison and as a quality control measure . for contemporary nonpregnant control samples ,
peripheral venous blood was drawn into heparinized vacutainer tubes that were processed and separated into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) following gradient centrifugation using ficoll - paque ( ge healthcare , uppsala , sweden ) .
plasma was collected and immediately frozen at 80c in 1 ml aliquots until use .
protein levels for 42 cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors ( table 1 ) were measured using the milliplex map human cytokine / chemokine kit ( millipore , billerica , ma , usa ) per manufacturer 's instructions . to minimize the potential for interassay variability , each subject had all of their longitudinal specimens analyzed on the same plate .
protein concentrations were determined using a linear regression standard curve from each plate generated using the high pmt concentrations with sensitivity from 3.2 to 2,000 pg / ml . all samples were tested in duplicate with the mean

moderate to high intensity aerobic - type exercise produces oxygen free radicals that can cause damage to lipid membranes , proteins , deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) and other cellular components .
the damage to lipid membranes , otherwise known as lipid peroxidation is defined as the oxidative deterioration of polyunsaturated fats in cellular lipid membranes caused by oxygen free radicals .
the area of antioxidant supplementation and its ameliorating effects on exercise induced free radical damage ( including lipid peroxidation ) has attracted considerable interest in recent years .
the theoretical benefits of using antioxidant vitamin supplements to quench oxygen free radicals appear large .
the damage to lipids caused by the oxygen free radicals can result in many problems such as the inactivation of cell membrane enzymes , increased permeability of ions across membranes ( decreased muscle cell functioning ) and increased platelet aggregation in blood vessels .
other problems may include the progression of degenerative diseases ( cardiovascular disease and cancer ) and lessening of the effectiveness of the immune system .
two theories support the concept that resistance exercise could lead to an increase in the production of oxygen free radicals in active muscle sites .
intense muscle contractions can result in a temporary decrease in blood flow and oxygen availability and subsequent ischemia .
the following reperfusion period ( muscle relaxation ) produces an abundant reintroduction of o2 and results in the formation of the o2 radical .
mechanical stress is another hypothesis used to explain an increase in free radicals . in particular , eccentric exercise causes high levels of force that has been shown to initiate muscle tissue damage .
this initiates the inflammation process that eventually produces oxygen free radicals and lipid peroxidation .
antioxidant supplementation may provide protection against the negative health consequences of oxygen free radicals caused by aerobic and resistance exercise .
vitamin e is probably the most focused upon and important non - enzymatic antioxidant substance in the body . unlike most nutrients ,
a specific role for vitamin e in a required metabolic function has not been found .
the major function of vitamin e is to work as a chain - breaking antioxidant in a fat soluble environment thus preventing the propagation of free radical reactions .
vitamin e is a lipid radical scavenger and especially protects polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufa ) within membrane phospholipids and in plasma lipoproteins .
lipid radicals react with vitamin e 1,000 times more rapidly than they do with pufa .
vitamin e provides an easily donated hydrogen to the lipid reaction and an antioxidant radical is created .
then , the new antioxidant radical combines with other antioxidant radicals and becomes harmless or combines with ascorbic acid and is converted back to tocopherol .
two studies involving vitamin e antioxidant supplementation and aerobic exercise have produced positive results , while six other studies [ 12,16 - 18,21,31 ] have produced ' no effect ' results .
the results showed that vitamin e supplementation was ineffective in reducing resistance exercise induced lipid peroxidation .
opposing views have developed with regards to whether trained participants have increased protection against oxygen free radicals .
researchers have explored antioxidant vitamins and enzymes that are found in blood plasma , in local tissue and within erythrocytes .
the primary objectives of the investigation were to determine : ( 1 ) whether a high intensity , whole body resistance exercise test ( ret ) caused lipid peroxidation measures to significantly increase , ( 2 ) the effects of a 2 week period of antioxidant vitamin supplementation ( vitamin e ) on the levels of lipid peroxidation measures caused by the ret , and ( 3 ) the impact that the training state ( untrained vs trained ) had on possible lipid peroxidation measures caused by the ret .
secondary purposes were to confirm whether a 2 week treatment period with vitamin e supplementation significantly increased blood plasma vitamin e levels and whether a 4 week washout period returned blood plasma vitamin e levels to baseline measures .
the group descriptive measures ( untrained vs trained ) are noted in table 1 , while the weights lifted ( 10 repetition maximum rm ) for each exercise during the resistance exercise test ( ret ) are listed in table 2 .
group descriptive measures * body fat predicted from skinfolds using the durnin and womersley formula .
resistance exercise test weights all 27 participants were found to be in the normal range of plasma vitamin e levels ( 12 to 37 umol / l ) before the study commenced .
there were no significant differences between the untrained and trained groups with regards to the general descriptive measures taken except within the body fat percentage category and past resistance training experience category .
the percentage of body fat was significantly higher in the untrained group ( 22.1 % 5.9 ) in comparison to the trained group ( 16.2 % 4.9 ) and as established by the enrolment criteria , the untrained group had greatly reduced experience in the weight room ( 0.1 year 0.1 ) in comparison to the trained group ( 5.2 years 2.6 ) .
there were significant differences

asthma is a chronic syndrome characterized by reversible airway obstruction , airway inflammation , and airway hyperresponsiveness ; estimates have indicated that 8% ( 18.7 million ) of adults in the united states currently have asthma , and more than 300 million people are affected by asthma worldwide . moreover , its prevalence has increased considerably in the past 20 years .
patients with asthma may experience recurrent episodes of chest tightness , shortness of breath , coughing , and wheezing ; consequently , people with this condition are at reportedly higher risks of nonrespiratory disorders such as depression , anxiety disorder , and dementia development compared with people without asthma .
the goal of current asthma management is to focus on managing rather than curing the disease .
migraine is a highly prevalent and disabling neurological disorder characterized by episodic unilateral headache attacks that are often accompanied by photophobia , phonophobia , nausea , and vomiting , and the estimated cumulative lifetime incidence of migraine is 43% in women and 18% in men .
although various factors have been identified to be associated with migraine attacks , such as stress , auditory hypersensitivity , and hormone imbalance , the pathogenesis of migraine is only partially understood .
asthma has been described as an acephalic migraine and pulmonary migraine , and several epidemiologic studies have reported an association between migraine and respiratory disorders .
however , some of these studies have used a relatively small sample , and all of them have adopted a case - control design .
no study has investigated the temporal frequency of migraine development in patients with asthma , and the results of previous studies may be difficult to generalize .
therefore , we conducted this retrospective nationwide cohort study by using data retrieved from taiwan 's national health insurance research database ( nhird ) to test the hypothesis that patients with asthma have a higher risk of migraine .
the nhird was created by the national health research institutes ( nhri ) and contains claims data from the taiwan national health insurance ( nhi ) program .
the nhi program , implemented in 1995 , is a compulsory single - payer health care system with over 99.9% coverage of the population of taiwan at the end of 2014 .
this study used the longitudinal health insurance database 2000 ( lhid2000 ) , which contains data for 1 million enrollees derived from the medical claims records of the nhi program between 1996 and 2011 .
the nhird contains beneficiary demographics , clinical visit dates , prescription details , and diagnostic codes based on the international classification of diseases , ninth revision , clinical modification ( icd-9-cm ) .
the nhri manages the claims data and provides scrambled random identification numbers for insured patients to secure patient privacy .
this study was approved by the institutional review board of china medical university ( cmuh-104-rec2 - 115 ) .
we conducted a nationwide retrospective population - based cohort study involving 2 groups : an asthma group and a nonasthma group . from outpatient and inpatient care dates in the lhid2000
, we identified 41,011 patients newly diagnosed with asthma ( icd-9-cm 493 ) between january 1 , 2000 and december 31 , 2005 .
we excluded patients from the analyses if they were younger than 12 years ( n = 13,813 ) , were previously diagnosed with migraine ( icd-9-cm-346 ) ( n = 1635 ) , or had missing information on age or sex ( n = 3 ) .
the date of asthma diagnosis was considered the index date . to ensure the accuracy of the asthma diagnosis
, we selected patients who had received treatment involving inhaled corticosteroids , systemic ( oral or intravenous ) corticosteroids , or inhaled beta-2 agonists ( short - acting beta-2 agonists [ sabas ] or long - acting beta-2 agonists [ labas ] ) as the asthma group .
for each patient with asthma , 4 insured persons without a diagnosis of asthma were selected from the lhid2000 as the nonasthma group and were frequency - matched according to sex , age ( every 5-year span ) , and index year by using the same inclusion criteria as those of the asthma cohort .
the considered demographic factors were sex and age ( 1219 , 2044 , and 45 years ) .
comorbidities were evaluated using the charlson comorbidity index ( cci ) and were considered confounding factors . according to each subject 's inpatient diagnosis , we calculated the cci scores as the sum of the weighted score of 17 comorbid conditions .
a weight was assigned to each indicated diagnosis and added together to provide a total cci score . for the cci score

many studies have shown that bracket debonding can cause enamel loss , particularly when the fracture occurs at the enamel - adhesive interface
. enamel damage may be in the form of enamel cracks , which may propagate during debonding [ 13 ] .
acid - etching , rinsing , drying and applying resin and bonding agents are the routine steps of conventional orthodontic bracket bonding .
concurrent with studies on the efficacy of the conventional technique , many studies , aimed at reducing the number of steps necessary for adhesion , have examined new bonding techniques with clinically adequate bond strength but less etching depth [ 56 ] .
traditional methods of bonding orthodontic brackets to teeth rely on acid etching to achieve adequate retention .
however , maintaining a sound enamel surface after bracket removal is of primary concern to clinicians .
bond failure at the bracket - adhesive interface or within the adhesive is generally considered 
safer than a fracture at the enamel - adhesive interface ; this is because studies have demonstrated that enamel fracture can occur during debonding . on the other hand ,
if a considerable amount of adhesive remains on the tooth surface after debonding , more chair time is required to remove the residual adhesive .
in addition , the process of removing the residual adhesive results in further enamel loss .
all - purpose or multi - purpose , self - adhesive resin cements are now commercially available in the market .
they are capable of bonding to different substrates such as enamel , dentin , amalgam , metal and porcelain [ 910 ] .
these cements require no surface pre - treatment due to their monomer and filler content and initiation technology .
the phosphoric acid methacrylates react with basic fillers in the luting cement and the hydroxyapatite of the tooth structure [ 1112 ] .
these self - adhesive cements do not require an etch and rinse phase as they are capable of conditioning the tooth surface and simultaneously preparing it for adhesion .
this not only shortens the clinical application time , but also significantly reduces technique - sensitivity and risk of errors during application or manipulation .
the aim of the current study was to assess the enamel cracks after debonding of brackets bonded with two different adhesive systems and also to evaluate enamel cracks after removing adhesive remnants and enamel polishing .
sixty upper central incisors , extracted due to periodontal disease , were selected and stored in normal saline at room temperature until required .
the study design was approved by the ethics committee of mashhad university of medical sciences . using a stereomicroscope ( blue light industry , waltham , ma , usa ) and digital camera ( exwave had , sony corporation , japan ) a magnified image ( 23.9x )
the number of enamel cracks and the length and direction of each crack were assessed with the aid of adobe photoshop cs software ( adobe systems incorporate , usa ) ( figure 1 ) .
enamel cracks before bracket bonding ( a ) , after deboning ( b ) and after polishing ( c ) .
new cracks are hatched . the number of visible cracks ( i.e. cracks visible to the naked eye ) was also recorded .
the teeth were then randomly divided into two equal groups . in the first group , the buccal surface of each central incisor
a standard edgewise twin metal bracket ( dentaurum , pforzheim , germany ) was bonded with transbond xt ( 3 m , usa ) to the center of the labial surface of each tooth . in the second group ,
the same bracket was bonded with self - adhesive composite cement ( maxcem elite , kerr , usa ) . in both groups ,
the adhesive was cured for 40 seconds ( 10 seconds on each side of the bracket ) .
the teeth were then incubated in distilled water at 37c for 24 hours to allow the material to set .
all the brackets were debonded with rmo i-546 remover pliers ( rmo , germany ) .
the blades of the pliers were placed at the bracket - adhesive interface and a gentle squeezing force was applied to the pliers by a zwick / z250 at a speed of 0.5 mm / min until bond failure occurred .
the present method of force application was modified from a diametric compression test for tension that indirectly measures tensile strength .
this approach was used because it simulates the usual clinical method for applying debonding forces .
the debonding force recorded by the zwick is not equal to the actual force applied at the bracket adhesive interface because the force was applied at a predetermined distance on the pliers beaks .
these forces , however , are proportional and can be expressed in the following ratio : the actual force ( f ) equals the measured

bone is a dynamic tissue which undergoes continuous self - renewal , and bone homeostasis relies on functional equilibrium among three types of cells : osteoclasts essential for bone resorption , osteoblasts responsible for bone matrix formation , and osteocytes involved in the reception and transduction of mechanical stimuli and in the regulation of osteoclast / osteoblast differentiation and function .
the balance between bone synthesis and resorption is finely tuned and any perturbations of this balance in adults trigger bone disease .
osteopetrosis ( osteo : bone and petros : stone ) regroups a set of rare , heterogeneous , and inherited bone diseases characterized by increased bone mass .
osteopetrosis is therefore an osteocondensing disease . in principle , two causes could give rise to this osteocondensing phenotype : increased bone formation or failure of resorption by osteoclasts .
however , osteopetrosis is known to result from defective osteoclast differentiation or function [ 3 , 4 ] .
important progress has been made during the past decades in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of hereditary diseases characterized by increased bone mass [ 3 , 5 ] .
our objective in this review is not to give a detailed description of all the sclerosing bone diseases ; such information can be found in other reviews [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 ] .
instead , we discuss recent findings regarding osteopetrosis and how the study of this disease has contributed to new understanding of functions associated with the skeleton [ 810 ] .
osteoclasts are highly specialized cells responsible for the dissolution of bone mineral and for the degradation of organic matrix .
osteoclasts are multinucleated cells ( containing up to 50 nuclei ) , derived from the fusion of mononuclear cells belonging to the monocyte - macrophage lineage . under the influence of factors secreted by osteoblasts and/or stromal cells present in the bone microenvironment
m - csf ( macrophage colony stimulating factor ) is expressed by osteoblasts and binds the c - fms receptor on osteoclast precursors , stimulating their proliferation and the expression of rank ( receptor activator of nf-b ) receptor .
the interaction of rank - l , expressed and secreted by osteoblasts and stromal cells , with its receptor propels the fusion of osteoclast progenitors to form a giant multinucleated cell .
a terminally differentiated osteoclast is able to degrade extracellular bone matrix by the action of specific proteins . to resorb bone matrix , osteoclasts must be perfectly polarized with a ruffle border and a sealing zone .
these two features allow the creation of a resorption lacuna into which h ions are actively secreted in order to acidify it , leading to dissolution of bone matrix hydroxyapatite .
type ii carbonic anhydrase ( caii ) hydrates co2 to form carbonic acid , which spontaneously dissociates into protons and hco3 ions .
the protons are actively transported into the resorption lacuna by a vacuolar atpase proton pump located in the ruffled border domain [ 1 , 11 ] .
the hco3 ion is exchanged with cl by a bicarbonate / chloride antiport on the basolateral membrane of the cell .
the chloride ion is translocated into the resorption lacuna through chloride channel 7 ( clcn7 ) , recently reclassified as chloride / proton antiport .
the acidic environment promotes the dissolution of inorganic content and also exposes the organic matrix , which is then ready to be digested by secreted proteolytic enzymes [ 1 , 11 ] .
the collagenous bone matrix is dissolved by two groups of enzymes , the matrix metalloproteases and the lysosomal cathepsins .
this enzyme is secreted into the resorption lacuna and degrades type i collagen in the acidic environment .
the acquisition and maintenance of osteoclast membrane polarity require a complex system of vesicle trafficking and ongoing cytoskeletal renewal .
one of the proteins involved in these processes is plekhm1 ( pleckstrin homolog domain containing family m with run domain member 1 ) .
this protein plays a crucial role in acidification and trafficking of intracellular vesicles [ 13 , 14 ] . a recently discovered protein important for osteoclast trafficking activity is snx10 ( sorting nexin 10 ) .
snx10 belongs to a family of about 30 proteins sharing the px ( phox homology ) phospholipid binding domain and is involved in protein trafficking and osteoclast differentiation / function [ 15 , 16 ] .
osteopetrosis is a generic name for a group of rare genetic

segmental copy - number variations ( cnvs ) , involving the gain or loss of several hundreds of bases to several hundred kilobases ( kb ) of the genome , can be an important source of genetic variation among human populations of different ethnic groups as well as among individuals .
molecular genetics analyses and cytogenetic analyses have provided significant information about these variations in the human genome , specifically as they relate to disease , such as cancer , and to congenital malformation ( see [ 1 , 2 ] , and review in ) . following
the development of methodologies and the introduction of new research platforms [ 49 ] , information regarding the nature and pattern of cnvs from representative populations have accumulated .
examinations of a relatively large number of individuals from various specific ethnic groups have recently been conducted using different array platforms , such as bac - arrays [ 1013 ] , oligo - arrays [ 1416 ] , and others .
the results are not always consistent and it is likely that different human populations bear different cnvs .
the numbers of japanese individuals examined to date are not so large compared to the studies for other ethnicities .
polymorphic cnvs have received considerable attention since they might play an important role in the etiology of common diseases .
therefore , more data regarding cnvs should be accumulated from japanese populations . in this report , we focus on cnvs which were observed at a high frequency ( 5.0% of the individuals ) in the population residing in hiroshima and nagasaki , japan by acgh with bac - clones as targets .
in the study , the population studies were conducted at two stages : stage ( 1 ) : 80 unrelated japanese individuals were examined using bac - acgh with an array having 2,241 bac clones , and stage ( 2 ) : 133 unrelated japanese individuals were examined using bac - acgh that contained 2,622 bac - clones .
the majority of the clones used in stage ( 1 ) of this study were selected from the set of cytogenetically mapped p1-artificial chromosome ( pac ) clones and bacterial artificial chromosome ( bac ) clones reported by the bac resource consortium and obtained from either the children 's hospital oakland research institute ( oakland , ca , usa ) or from invitrogen inc . , co. ( carlsbad , ca , usa ) . in stage
( 2 ) , in addition to bac clones used in stage ( 1 ) , an additional 381 bac clones were used , a majority of which were collaboratively obtained from dr . n. matsumoto of yokohama city university .
the 2,241 clones of chromosomal fragments from chromosome 1 to chromosome 22 were used in stage ( 1 ) and 2,622 clones were used in stage ( 2 ) , respectively .
that is , the additional 381 bac clones were examined for only 133 unrelated individuals in stage ( 2 ) .
those clones are distributed every 1.2 mb across all of the human autosomes in stage ( 1 ) , and 1.1 mb in stage ( 2 ) , respectively .
in addition to autosomal clones , four kinds of x - chromosomal clones were used as internal references . with respect to examination for stage ( 1 ) , three sets of arrays were constructed and imprinted : slide no.1 , consisted of 698 clones on chromosomes 1 to 4 ; slide no.2 consisted of 718 clones on chromosomes 5 to 10 , plus two bac clones on chromosome 3 , and six clones on chromosome 4 ; and slide no.3 consisted of 817 clones on chromosomes 11 to 22 . for stage ( 2 ) , all of the clones were printed onto one glass slid .
the genomic dna samples used in this study were principally the same as those used in a previous study .
the dna samples used for reference purposes were extracted from mononuclear cells of two physically and clinically normal volunteers ( a 57-year - old japanese male and a 54-year - old japanese female ) .
the dna used for testing and analyses of this population was extracted from lymphoblastoid cell lines obtained from the offspring of atomic - bomb survivors .
high molecular weight genomic dna was isolated using conventional methods as described in detail elsewhere .
lymphoblastoid cell lines were derived from a cryopreserved archive of approximately 1000 families consisting of father , mother , and offspring from hiroshima and nagasaki for whom permanent cell lines have been established by epstein - barr ( eb ) virus transformation of peripheral b - lymphocytes . the composition of the families has been reported elsewhere .

cerebral inflammation plays an 
 important role in the pathogenesis of secondary brain injury following 
 traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) [ 1 , 2 ] . proinflammatory nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) 
 signaling pathway has been well documented in previous studies of our 
 laboratory [ 3 , 4 ] . increased levels of inflammatory agents with the injured 
 brain , including tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) , interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) , 
 interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) , and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( icam-1 ) , are 
 believed to contribute to the cerebral damage .
their mediator nf-b activation enhances the transcription of proinflammatory 
 cytokines , and the cytokines are known to in turn activate nf-b .
the 
 positive feedback is believed to serve to amplify inflammatory signals and exacerbate 
 brain injury after tbi .
recent researches have demonstrated that nuclear factor 
 erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) , a key transcription factor that regulates 
 the cellular antioxidant response , plays a broader role in modulating acute 
 inflammatory response [ 8 , 9 ] . under basal conditions ,
nrf2 is sequestered in 
 the cytoplasm by the cytosolic regulatory protein keap1 . in conditions of 
 oxidative or xenobiotic stress , nrf2 translocates from the cytoplasm to the 
 nucleus , and
sequentially binds to a promoter sequence called the antioxidant 
 response element ( are ) , resulting in a cytoprotective response which is 
 characterized by upregulation of a group of antioxidant enzymes and decreased 
 sensitivity to oxidative damage [ 1012 ] .
these antioxidant enzymes have also 
 been shown to protect cells against acute inflammatory response .
numerous studies have reported that nrf2 plays a critical 
 role in counteracting inflammation in a variety of experimental models .
nrf2 
 protects against allergen - mediated airway inflammation , cigarette 
 smoke - induced emphysema , dextran sulfate sodium ( dss)-mediated colitis 
 , inflammation - mediated colonic tumorigenesis , and inflammatory 
 responses during skin wound healing .
furthermore , nrf2 has also been 
 reported as a crucial regulator of the innate immune response and survival 
 during experimental sepsis . in one of our previous studies
therefore , it may be reasonable to postulate that nrf2 plays 
 an important role in limiting the cerebral inflammatory response after tbi . in 
 our study
, we evaluated the influence of nrf2 genotype on the cerebral upregulation 
 of nf-b activity , proinflammatory cytokine , and icam-1 after tbi .
our experiments were conformed to 
 guide for the care and use of laboratory animals from national institutes of 
 health and approved by the animal care and use committee of nanjing university .

many recent articles highlight the data revolution in healthcare , an offshoot of the vast amount of digital medical information that has now accumulated in electronic medical records ( emrs ) , and present it as an opportunity to create a learning healthcare system. the generally proposed vision is for a population data - driven knowledge system that generalizes from every patient s life , disease and treatment experiences to impute the best course of action for diagnosis , prognosis and treatment of future patients .
there have also been many articles focusing on the risk that nave use of big data ( or data in general ) poses .
as stated by zak kohane of harvard medical school , big data in healthcare can not be a simple , blind application of black - box techniques : you really need to know something about medicine .
if statistics lie , then big data can lie in a very , very big way .
this paper will discuss the general issue of data in critical care with a focus on the big data phenomenon that is sweeping healthcare . with the vast amount of digital medical information that has accumulated in emrs , the challenge is the transformation of the copious data into usable and useful medical knowledge .
we are experiencing a rapidly expanding collection of vast amounts of clinical data from routine practice and ambulatory monitoring .
clinicians must already make sense of a diverse variety of data input streams in order to make clinical decisions .
data from our everyday activities ( financial transactions , cellphone and internet use , social media posts ) , the environment , and even the local government promise to provide even more clinically relevant information ( figure 1 ) , but to what end ? and how can increasing amounts of data be incorporated into a system of already overburdened clinicians?figure 1 
 where big data in healthcare come from ( figure courtesy of yuan lai ) . 
 
 where big data in healthcare come from ( figure courtesy of yuan lai ) . 
 
the bottom line is that pertinent quality data add tremendous value , which accounts for their 
unreasonable effectiveness. there is no way to minimize undesirable variability in practice without the data to substantiate the standardization .
the volume and variety of increasingly available big data can allow us to interrogate clinical practice variation , personalize the risk - benefit score for every test and intervention , discover new knowledge to understand disease mechanisms , and optimize processes such as medical decision making , triage and resource allocation .
clinical data have been notorious for their variable interoperability and quality , but a holistic use of the massive data sources available ( vital signs , clinical notes , laboratory results , treatments including medications and procedures ) can lead to new perspectives on challenging problems .
while the wetware of the human mind is a wonderful instrument for this purpose , we must design better data systems to support and improve those components of this data integration process that exceed human abilities .
decisions in the intensive care unit ( icu ) are frequently made in the setting of a high degree of uncertainty , and clinical staff may have only minutes or even seconds to make those decisions .
the increasing need for intensive care has spiked the ratio of icu beds to hospital beds as the icu plays an expanding role in acute hospital care .
but the value of many treatments and interventions in the icu is unproven , with many standard treatments being ineffective , minimally effective , questionably effective , or even harmful to the patient . in a setting where the effects of every intervention are subject to patient and clinical context - specific factors , the ability to use data for decision support becomes very attractive and closer to essential as increasing complexity transcends typical cognitive capabilities .
an example of collected data being used to infer high - level information is the icu scoring systems in use today .
icu scoring systems , such as apache ( acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ) , mpm ( mortality probability model ) , and saps ( simplified acute physiology score ) , are all based on the use of physiologic and other clinical data for severity adjustment ( table 1 ) .
while these scores are primarily used to assess and compare icu performance ( e. g. , by examining the ratio of actual - to - predicted outcomes ) they also have use as short - hand indicators of patient acuity . but scoring system value depends not only on the accuracy of the underlying data , but also on clinical trust in the reliability of the data and the predictions based on that data . in 2012 , scoring systems were used in only 10% to 15% of us icus , despite demonstrated good discrimination and calibration .table 1

a packet was sent to the clinical microbiology laboratories of the 77 hospitals in the area .
it included a letter describing the project , a questionnaire on hospital characteristics and laboratory testing methods , and a request for existing antibiograms from the most recent period for which completed data were available .
the numbers of isolates tested and number of susceptible isolates were added for each antimicrobial agent from all hospitals for each region ( table a1 ) and for all regions combined .
data from 10 hospitals were excluded , 7 because the aggregated antibiograms did not include the number of isolates tested and 3 because the antibiogram data predated january 2001 .
thirty - one hospitals that were included in the final analysis represented the 4 regions as follows : 16 ( 42% ) of 38 hospitals in the central region , 6 ( 43% ) of 14 in the west , 4 ( 40% ) of 10 in the south , and 5 ( 33% ) of 15 in the southwest .
of the hospitals included , 16% did not send a cumulative antibiogram but instead sent their data as a monthly report for a period from 3 months to 1 year .
the proposed guidelines for analyzing and presenting cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility data were published by the clinical and laboratory standards institute ( formerly nccls ) in 2002 .
the m39-a document provides a standardized means of data extraction for all drugs tested and outlines the most appropriate way to present the data ( 2 ) . in our discussions with laboratory personnel , we found that many laboratories are unaware of these guidelines , and laboratories that use the document find that adhering to all recommendations is difficult .
many laboratories lack a microbiology supervisor with insight into the clinical relevance of the results they generate .
for example , a laboratory reported 4% vancomycin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae , but the laboratory staff was not able to explain this finding or recognize the clinical implications . also 2 of the hospitals reported 2 vancomycin - intermediate staphylococcus aureus in their antibiogram . however , the isolates were not available for verification , and the laboratory staff was not aware of the implications of this finding .
the staff did not know that such findings should be reported to the illinois department of public health and the centers for disease control and prevention . in all regions ,
coagulase - negative staphylococci , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and enterococcus faecalis were among the 5 most frequently reported species ( tables a1 and a2 ) .
the 10 most frequently reported species in our study are generally comparable to those found in the sentry survey conducted by pfaller et al .
isolates tested in the central , west , south , and southwest regions , 27% , 53% , 34% , and 42% , respectively , were resistant to methicillin .
of the hospitals that reported speciation of enterococci , e. faecalis was susceptible to vancomycin at 91%99% .
however , hospitals from the southwest area reported enterococci other than e. faecalis as enterococcus spp . only .
the unusually low susceptibility of e. faecium in our study may be attributed to specimen duplication . in the central illinois region ,
the susceptibility of s. pneumoniae to penicillin was 64%75% , and 52%77% of isolates were susceptible to erythromycin .
the susceptibility of common gram - positive bacteria in our study appears to be lower than reported national averages ( 3 ) . although antibiogram surveillance and active surveillance yield comparable results ( 4 ) , national data may not be directly comparable to our findings because national data used for comparison results from active surveillance with different reporting periods .
in spite of expertise and resources available in the united states , the use of antimicrobial drugs in day - to - day practice is suboptimal and directly responsible for multidrug resistance in a number of common pathogens .
the factor that converts antimicrobial therapy from " empiric " to " rational " is in vitro susceptibility testing and reporting .
however , if these tests are either not conducted or conducted poorly , they are not useful clinically and may create a false sense that therapy is rationally guided .
given the differences and shortcomings we reported among laboratories in a region , national recommendations are either unknown or not followed .
use of expertise , cooperation , and collaboration at the regional levels may be the simplest and most useful public health measures to optimize the usefulness of diagnostic microbiology in managing infectious diseases .
antimicrobial drug use guidelines , if they are based on consistent , reproducible , and comparable data between different laboratories , will produce better outcomes .
a master antibiogram for a region would allow a tertiary care institution to consider resistance patterns in hospitals referring patients and to select appropriate " presumptive "

multiple surveillance systems are used in the united states each year to characterize seasonal influenza epidemics and to detect unusual events such as infections with novel viruses or those with pandemic potential .
these systems track a variety of outcomes , including laboratoryconfirmed influenza hospitalizations , outpatient visits for influenzalike illness ( ili ) , pneumonia and influenzacoded deaths for all ages , pediatric laboratoryconfirmed deaths , and positive laboratory samples . 
 despite the utility of these existing systems , additional data to estimate disease severity and track illness at the state level were needed during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic , as timely and representative information describing 2009 pandemic influenza a ( h1n1 ) ( ph1n1 ) activity
the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists ( cste ) established the aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity ( ahdra ) as part of an overall national surveillance strategy implemented to collect timely and representative data describing ph1n1 infections in the united states .
the ahdra was designed to ( i ) track severe disease within states and territories to better characterize the focal nature of the pandemic , ( ii ) track disease trends over brief periods of time to facilitate rapid public health responses to changes in ph1n1 epidemiology , and ( iii ) accommodate variation in local resources by providing a simple , flexible method that allowed reliable reporting by all states and territories without overwhelming health departments during the pandemic response . in this report
, we describe the methods and implementation of ahdra and provide preliminary results from this new surveillance activity .
from august 30 , 2009 , through april 6 , 2010 , cdc requested weekly reporting of influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths from all 50 us states , the district of columbia , new york city , and six us territories .
states and territories were asked to identify hospitalizations and deaths in their jurisdictions according to either a laboratoryconfirmed or syndromic surveillance definition and could use either definition to report hospitalizations or deaths .
 polymerase chain reaction ( rtpcr ) testing , direct fluorescent antigen testing ( dfa ) , immunofluorescent antigen testing , or viral culture ; identification of influenza type or subtype was not required .
syndromic reports included cases of pneumonia and influenza based on clinical syndrome , admission or discharge data , or a combination of data elements that could include diagnostic laboratory test results .
prior to the first reporting period , 33 jurisdictions indicated they intended to submit laboratoryconfirmed hospitalizations , and 20 indicated they would submit syndromic hospitalizations .
thirtysix jurisdictions intended to submit laboratoryconfirmed death reports , and 17 indicated they would submit syndromic deaths ; information describing method of reporting was unavailable for one state and four territories .
jurisdictions were instructed to submit aggregate counts each week by age group ( 04 , 518 , 1924 , 2549 , 5064 , and 65 years ) .
aggregate counts were used to calculate agespecific weekly and cumulative rates per 100 000 according to 2008 postcensal us population estimates . laboratoryconfirmed and
syndromic data were analyzed for relative increase or decrease by state each week , and laboratoryconfirmed cumulative rates were used to describe the age distribution of ph1n1 influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths . owing to differences between laboratoryconfirmed and syndromic reporting definitions , we calculated two national incidence estimates of ph1n1 influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths : one extrapolating reports from laboratoryconfirmed jurisdictions to the entire country and one extrapolating reports from syndromic jurisdictions to the entire country .
calculation of rates involving laboratoryconfirmed influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths used the populations of states reporting laboratoryconfirmed cases as a denominator ; calculations involving syndromic influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths used the populations of states reporting syndromic cases as a denominator .
laboratoryconfirmed reports from ahdra were used to estimate weekly , age groupspecific national influenzaassociated deathtohospitalization ratios .
these ratios were incorporated into a model used to estimate the national illness burden of influenzaassociated cases , hospitalizations and deaths during the pandemic , accounting for variation in medical careseeking , laboratory practice and detection capability , and underreporting of confirmed cases . 

 
all data were maintained in a database on a secure server at cdc , and all analyses were performed using microsoft excel and sas v 9.1 ( sas institute , cary , nc , usa ) .
this activity was determined by cdc to be part of routine public health practice and was not subject to institutional review board approval for human research protections .
the median number of jurisdictions reporting laboratoryconfirmed hospitalizations each week was 36 ( range 2938 ) , and the median number of jurisdictions reporting syndromic hospitalizations each

bilateral shoulder dislocation are most commonly posterior type . these are most commonly due to seizure disorder and electrocution .
to best of our knowledge there are only few cases of similar kind are reported in literature .
we hereby report a interesting case of posttraumatic , bilateral anterior dislocation of shoulder without associated fracture in a 45 old women without any predisposing pathoanatomy .
a 45-year - old women presented to casualty with sudden onset of pain and restriction of movement in both shoulders fallowing trauma .
immediately post trauma she had severe pain and restriction of both shoulders . on examination arms were abducted and externally rotated .
there was loss of round contour of shoulder with increased vertical diameter of axilla anteriorly .
bilateral traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations are rare and are seen as a result of unique mechanism of injury . in our case patient
bilateral shoulder dislocations are usually posterior type and are almost pathognomonic of seizure disorder or electrocution . though anterior dislocation of shoulder is commonest bilateral simultaneous dislocation is very rare[1 - 7 ] .
we hereby report a case of posttraumatic , bilateral anterior dislocation of shoulder without associated fracture in a 45 old women .
a 45-year - old women presented to lok nayak hospital , new delhi , india in august 2010 with sudden onset of pain and restriction of movement in both shoulders fallowing trauma .
she had no history of seizure , epilepsy , previous shoulder dislocation or instability in other joints . on examination arms
. there was loss of round contour of shoulder with increased vertical diameter of axilla anteriorly .
radiological examination revealed bilateral anterior dislocation of the shoulders without any associated fractures(figure 2 ) .
radiograph showing bilateral shoulder dislocation concentric reduction of bilateral shoulder joint achieved closed reduction done by milch technique after intraraticular lignocaine injection .
majority of the bilateral shoulder dislocations are of posterior type most commonly seen during convulsion , electric shock or hypoglycaemic seizures .
posterior type is common in these conditions due to violent contractions of the muscles of the shoulder girdle [ 8 - 10 ] . unlike
bilateral occurrence of anterior shoulder dislocation is rare because of the fact that one extremity takes the brunt of the impact .
to best of our knowledge only three cases of bilateral anterior dislocations are reported in literature . in two of the three cases reported were sequential , one sided followed by contra lateral side dislocation . in our case impact is same on both shoulders at the same time .
the mechanism of anterior dislocation is forced extension , abduction and external rotation of the arm . in our case mechanism of injury
mechanism of injury , systemic disease and associated fractures in various similar cases is depicted in table 1 .
croswell and smith reported a case of bilateral anterior dislocation of the shoulder without any fractures in a bench - pressing athlete . in an unusual mechanism of injury weight on the bar forced his arms into hyperextension in the mid - abducted position .
the humeral shaft gradually pivoted on the bench and the humeral heads were slowly dislocated interiorly by the weight of the bar .
sandeep s and sudhir k reported a case of sequential bilateral anterior dislocation in which the left shoulder dislocated first due to trauma followed by atraumatic dislocation of the right shoulder . sreesobh k v et al reported a case where atraumatic right shoulder dislocation was followed by traumatic dislocation of the left .
this type of dislocation involves a unique type of mechanism injury and in our case it was fall on pointed elbow causing forced extension .
traumatic bilateral anterior dislocations without any pathologic lesion are very rare with only few cases reported in literature .

the nshd is a socially stratified birth cohort of 2547 men and 2815 women of white european descent born during 1 wk in 1946 who have been followed with repeated data collections since then ( 14 ) . between 2006 and 2010 , at 6064 yr , contact was made with 2661 ( 84% ) of 3164 eligible study members still alive and living in england , scotland , or wales .
no contact was attempted for those who had died ( n = 717 ) , were living abroad ( n = 567 ) , had previously withdrawn from the study ( n = 595 ) , or had been lost to follow - up for more than 10 yr ( n = 319 ) . of the 2661 who provided information , 1690 ( 63.5% ) attended one of six regional clinical research facilities ;
the remainder were visited at home or completed a postal questionnaire only ( 18 ) .
inclusion criteria for the current analysis was men with data on birth weight and voice breaking at age 14 yr ( n = 2001 ) .
the study received multi - centre research ethics committee approval , and informed consent was given by cohort participants .
birth weight to the nearest quarter pound ( 113 g ) was extracted from medical records and converted to kilograms .
heights and weights were measured using standard protocols at ages 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 11 , 15 , 36 , 43 , 53 , and 6064 yr and were self - reported at ages 20 and 26 yr .
pubertal characteristics were described by the child 's school doctor ( medically qualified practitioners who regularly attended schools as part of routine primary care ) , at a special clinic examination in 1961 when the boys were 14 yr old ( mean 14.5 , range 14.315.2 yr ) . in boys
, the school doctor was asked to rate appearance of the genitals as infantile , early , or advanced .
axillary hair was rated as no or yes . voice - breaking status was rated as no , starting to break , or completely broken . during clinic visits at 6064 yr
, measures of body composition were obtained in the supine position using a qdr 4500 discovery scanner ( hologic inc . ,
bedford , ma ) ; the same software ( hologic apex version 3.1 ) , hardware , and procedures were used in each clinic , and all measures were calibrated internally and across clinics using a european spine phantom . from these scans ,
whole - body fat and lean mass , android ( abdominal ) region fat mass and gynoid region fat mass , and appendicular lean mass were obtained and converted into kilograms .
the ratio of android to gynoid fat mass was derived , with higher values indicating greater fat distribution in the abdomen than hips .
lean mass was defined as mass excluding fat and bone mass , and in all measures , data from the head were excluded due to the high proportion of bone mass known to affect the accuracy of soft - tissue measures ( 19 ) .
routine anthropometric measures were taken during the clinic visit using standardized protocols by trained nurses ( 18 ) . in total ,
746 male participants had data available for all body composition outcomes , with missing data mostly due to artifacts such as pacemakers obstructing the x - rays .
bmi at each measurement and maternal bmi were calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared .
measures of bmi , weight , and height were converted into sds using internally generated growth charts , which is preferable for historical cohorts , and were constructed using the lms method ( where l is skewness , m is median , and s is coefficient ) ( 20 ) .
hd - sds was originally described as the difference between adolescent height sds ( at age 14 yr in males ) and adult height sds ( 16 ) , and we calculated this parameter as height sds at 36 yr minus height sds at 14 yr because 36 yr was the first time adult height was measured in the nshd .
lower hd - sds values indicate those males with less growth occurring after age 14 yr and who therefore had earlier pubertal growth acceleration and more advanced pubertal maturation at age 14 yr than those with higher hd - sds values ( 16 ) .
conditional hd - sds was calculated as adolescent height sds ( r adult height sds)/(1 r ) , where r is the pearson correlation coefficient for the association between adolescent height sds and adult height sds .
this equation was
