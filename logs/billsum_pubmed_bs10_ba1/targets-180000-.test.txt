hypertension ( htn ) is the most common co - morbidity in the world , and its sequelae , heart failure ( hf ) is one of most common causes of mortality and morbidity in the world . 
 current understanding of pathophysiology and management of htn in hf is mainly based on studies , which have mainly included whites . among racial groups , 
 african - american adults have the highest rates ( 44% ) of hypertension in the world and are more resistant to treatment . 
 there is an emerging consensus on the significance of racial disparities in the pathophysiology and treatment options of hypertension and heart failure . 
 however , african americans had been underrepresented in all the trials until the initiation of the a - heft trial . since the recognition of obstructive sleep apnea ( osa ) as an important medical condition , 
 large clinical trials have shown benefits of osa treatment among patients with htn and hf . 
 this paper focuses on the pathophysiology , causes of secondary hypertension , and treatment of hypertension among african - american patients with heart failure . 
 there is increasing need for randomized clinical trials testing innovative treatment options for african - american patients .

lycopene has been proposed to protect against prostate cancer through various properties including decreased lipid oxidation , inhibition of cancer cell proliferation , and most notably potent antioxidant properties . 
 epidemiologic studies on the association between lycopene and prostate cancer incidence have yielded mixed results . 
 detection of an association has been complicated by unique epidemiologic considerations including the measurement of lycopene and its major source in the diet , tomato products , and assessment of prostate cancer incidence and progression . understanding this association has been further challenging in the prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) screening era . 
 psa screening has increased the detection of prostate cancer , including a variety of relatively indolent cancers . 
 this paper examines the lycopene and prostate cancer association in light of epidemiologic methodologic issues with particular emphasis on the effect of psa screening on this association .

patients with chronic hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection and persistently normal alanine aminotransferase ( pnalt ) are generally described to have mild liver disease . 
 the aim of this study was to compare clinical and histological features in hcv - infected patients with pnalt and elevated alt . 
 patients presenting to the university of illinois medical center , chicago , who had biopsy proven hcv , an alt measurement at the time of liver biopsy , at least one additional alt measurement over the next 12 months , and liver biopsy slides available for review were identified . 
 pnalt was defined as alt 30 on at least 2 different occasions over 12 months . 
 of 1200 patients with hcv , 243 met the study criteria . 
 13% ( 32/243 ) of patients had pnalt while 87% ( 211/243 ) had elevated alt . 
 significantly more patients with pnalt had advanced fibrosis ( f3 and f4 ) compared to those with elevated alt ( p = 0.007 ) . 
 there was no significant difference in the histology activity index score as well as mean inflammatory score between the two groups . in conclusion

torque is a tool for cross - species querying of protein 
 protein interaction networks . it aims to answer the following question : given a set of proteins constituting a known complex or a pathway in one species , can a similar complex or pathway be found in the protein network of another species ? to this end , torque seeks a matching set of proteins that are sequence similar to the query proteins and span a connected region of the target network , while allowing for both insertions and deletions . unlike existing approaches 
 , torque does not require knowledge of the interconnections among the query proteins . 
 it can handle large queries of up to 25 proteins . 
 the torque web server is freely available for use at http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/bnet/torque.html .

the prevention of chagas disease is based primarily on the chemical control of 
 triatoma infestans ( klug ) using pyrethroid insecticides . 
 however , 
 high resistance levels , correlated with control failures , have been detected in 
 argentina and bolivia . 
 a previous study at our laboratory found that imidacloprid 
 could serve as an alternative to pyrethroid insecticides . 
 we studied the delayed 
 toxicity of imidacloprid and the influence of the blood feeding condition of the 
 insect on the toxicity of this insecticide ; we also studied the effectiveness of 
 various commercial imidacloprid formulations against a pyrethroid - resistant 
 t. infestans population from the gran chaco ecoregion . 
 variations 
 in the toxic effects of imidacloprid were not observed up to 72 h after exposure and 
 were not found to depend on the blood feeding condition of susceptible and resistant 
 individuals . 
 of the three different studied formulations of imidacloprid on glass and 
 filter paper , only the spot - on formulation was effective .

femoroacetabular impingement ( fai ) occurs when an osseous abnormality of the proximal femur ( cam ) or acetabulum ( pincer ) triggers damage to the acetabular labrum and articular cartilage in the hip . 
 although the precise etiology of fai is not well understood , both types of fai are common in athletes presenting with hip pain , loss of range - of - motion , and disability in athletics . 
 an open surgical approach to decompressing fai has shown good clinical outcomes ; however , this highly invasive approach inherently may delay or preclude a high level athlete s return to play . 
 the purpose of this study was to define associated pathologies and determine if an arthroscopic approach to treating fai can allow professional athletes to return to high - level sport . 
 hip arthroscopy for the treatment of fai allows professional athletes to return to professional sport . between october 2000 and september 2005 , 
 45 professional athletes underwent hip arthroscopy for the decompression of fai . 
 operative and return - to - play data were obtained from patient records .

cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast can be divided into two categories : primary and metastatic lesions . 
 cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast is a rare tumor , accounting for less than 5% of all malignant melanomas . 
 clinical features and diagnostic methods of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast are similar to those arising from other cutaneous areas . 
 treatment of choice is wide local excision with adequate resection margin according to tumor thickness . 
 sentinel lymph node biopsy should be performed because the presence of lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor . 
 there have been only limited reports involving primary cutaneous malignant melanoma of the breast . 
 thus , we report a case of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma in a 59-year - old woman with a review of the recent literature .

heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( hnrnps ) are spliceosomal macromolecular assemblages and thus actively participate in pre - mrna metabolism . 
 they are composed of evolutionarily conserved and tandemly repeated motifs , where both rna - binding and protein - protein recognition occur to achieve cellular activities . by yet unknown mechanisms , these ribonucleoprotein ( rnp ) particles are targeted by autoantibodies and hence play significant role in a variety of human systemic autoimmune diseases . 
 this feature makes them important prognostic markers in terms of molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of autoimmunity . 
 since rnp domain is one of the most conserved and widespread scaffolds , evolutionary analyses of these rna - binding domains can provide further clues on disease - specific epitope formation . 
 the study presented herein represents a sequence comparison of rna - recognition regions of recently cloned and characterized human hnrnp a3 with those of other relevant hnrnp a / b - type proteins . 
 their implications in human autoimmunity are particularly emphasized .

bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics by mutation , transformation , and/or acquisition of new genes which are normally associated with mobile elements ( plasmids , transposons , and integrons ) . 
 mobile elements are the main driving force in horizontal gene transfer between strains , species , and genera and are responsible for the rapid spread of particular elements throughout a bacterial community and between ecosystems . 
 today , antibiotic resistant bacteria are widely distributed throughout the world and have even been isolated from environments that are relatively untouched by human civilization . in this 
 review macrolides , lincosamides , streptogramins , and tetracycline resistance genes and bacteria will be discussed with an emphasis on the resistance genes which are unique to environmental bacteria which are defined for this review as species and genera that are primarily found outside of humans and animals .

summary 
 pseudozyma species rarely cause invasive diseases in humans , which are usually isolated from plants . 
 there have been anecdotal reports regarding pseudozyma species infections in patients with underlying diseases or in neonates 
 . however , clinical data and the pathogenicity in humans are still insufficient . 
 we experienced a case of pseudozyma aphidis fungaemia with invasive fungal pneumonia that developed during reinduction chemotherapy in a 51yearold male with acute myeloid leukaemia ( aml ) . 
 p. aphidis was suspected based on the morphology of the yeast isolated from the blood and was confirmed via rdna gene sequencing analysis . 
 the patient successfully underwent stem cell transplantation with continuing antifungal treatment and finally completely recovered from both the aml and infectious complications . here , we report a case of p. aphidis infection that developed during neutropenia in an aml patient and review the global literature .

foot ulceration ( fu ) remains a serious concern for patients worldwide . 
 we analyzed the incidence , risk factors , and outcome of fu in hemodialysis ( hd ) patients . 
 a retrospective cohort study was conducted for 252 hd patients who were followed up for 5 years . 
 patients were categorized according to whether they developed fu or not . 
 the fu group ( 17% ) was older and had significantly higher incidence of nephropathy , retinopathy , peripheral ( pad ) , coronary artery disease ( cad ) , and diabetes mellitus ( dm ) as compared to no - fu group . 
 fu group had higher frequency of major amputation ( p = 0.001 ) and hd vascular access ( p = 0.01 ) . 
 patients with combined dm and pad had a 10-fold increased risk of fu in comparison to those who had dm alone . 
 presence of pad was the main independent predictor for development of fu in hd with an adjusted odd ratio ( aor ) of 16.0 ( 95% ci : 4.4162.18 ; p = 0.001 ) .

our previous study of a chinese family with dilated cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) suggested that a1180v of the cardiac sodium channel gene ( scn5a ) was associated with the disease within this family . according to data deposited in dbsnp , however 
 , a1180v has been found in some small samples of the asian population . in this study 
 , we followed up the affected pedigree and expanded the investigation of the prevalence of a1180v in 460 unrelated healthy han chinese . besides , we searched and analyzed it in other database as well . during the follow - up period , 1 a1180v carrier 's condition deteriorated alot , and another 4 carriers progressed to dcm or atrioventricular block ( avb ) . 
 we also found that the a1180v was absent among the 460 individuals ( 0% , 0/460 ) , and the carrier frequency of a1180v among chinese was about 0.51% obtained from the 1000 genome project . in conclusion , our finding suggests that a1180v is a potential risk factor for dcm , and it is extremely rare among healthy han chinese .

the eye lens crystallins represent 
 an ideal target for studying 
 the effects of aging on protein structure . 
 herein we examine separately 
 the water - soluble ( ws ) and water - insoluble ( wi ) crystallin fractions 
 and identify sites of isomerization and epimerization . both collision - induced 
 dissociation and radical - directed dissociation 
 are needed for detection 
 of these non - mass - shifting post - translational modifications . 
 isomerization 
 levels differ significantly between the ws and the wi fractions from 
 sheep , pig , and cow eye lenses . 
 residues that are most susceptible 
 to isomerization are identified site - specifically and are found to 
 reside in structurally disordered regions . 
 however , isomerization 
 in structured domains , although less common , often yields more dramatic 
 effects on solubility . 
 numerous isomerization hotspots were also identified 
 and occur in regions with aspartic acid and serine repeats . 
 for example , 128kmeivdddvpslw140 in b3

protein phosphatase 2a- ( pp2a- ) catalyzed dephosphorylation of target substrate proteins is widespread and critical for cellular function . 
 pp2a is predominantly found as a heterotrimeric complex of a catalytic subunit ( c ) , a scaffolding subunit ( a ) , and one member of 4 families of regulatory subunits ( b ) . 
 substrate specificity of the holoenzyme complex is determined by the subcellular locale the complex is confined to , selective incorporation of the b subunit , interactions with endogenous inhibitory proteins , and specific intermolecular interactions between pp2a and target substrates . here 
 , we discuss recent studies that have advanced our understanding of the molecular determinants for pp2a substrate specificity .

double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) are one of the severest types of dna damage . 
 unrepaired dsbs easily induce cell death and chromosome aberrations . to maintain genomic stability , cells have checkpoint and dsb repair systems to respond to dna damage throughout most of the cell cycle . 
 the failure of this process often results in apoptosis or genomic instability , such as aneuploidy , deletion , or translocation . 
 therefore , dsb repair is essential for maintenance of genomic stability . during mitosis 
 , however , cells seem to suppress the dna damage response and proceed to the next g1 phase , even if there are unrepaired dsbs . the biological significance of this suppression is not known . in this review , we summarize recent studies of mitotic dsb repair and discuss the mechanisms of suppression of dsb repair during mitosis . 
 dsb repair , which maintains genomic integrity in other phases of the cell cycle , is rather toxic to cells during mitosis , often resulting in chromosome missegregation and aberration . 
 cells have multiple safeguards to prevent genomic instability

primary oral melanoma is a rare neoplasm of melanocytic origin , accounting for 0.5% of all oral malignancies . 
 the chameleonic presentation of a mainly asymptomatic condition , rarity of this lesion , poor prognosis , and the necessity of a highly specialized treatment are factors that should be seriously considered by the involved health provider . 
 here is a case report presenting a malignant melanoma of oral mucosa in 48-year - old male patient on maxillary gingiva . 
 the lesion was removed by partial maxillectomy and patient is disease free after 11 months of regular followup . 
 this case provides an example of how dental clinicians play a major role in the identification of pigmented lesions of oral cavity and also emphasize on the fact that any pigmented lesion detected in the oral cavity may exhibit potential growth and should be submitted to biopsy to exclude malignancy .

work has shown that stem cell transplantation can rescue or replace neurons in models of retinal degenerative disease . 
 neural progenitor cells ( npcs ) modified to overexpress neurotrophic factors are one means of providing sustained delivery of therapeutic gene products in vivo . to develop a nonrodent animal model of this therapeutic strategy , we previously derived npcs from the fetal cat brain ( cnpcs ) . 
 here we use bicistronic feline lentiviral vectors to transduce cnpcs with glial cell - derived neurotrophic factor ( gdnf ) together with a gfp reporter gene . 
 transduction efficacy is assessed , together with transgene expression level and stability during induction of cellular differentiation , together with the influence of gdnf transduction on growth and gene expression profile . 
 we show that gdnf overexpressing cnpcs expand in vitro , coexpress gfp , and secrete high levels of gdnf protein before and after differentiation all qualities advantageous for use as a cell - based approach in feline models of neural degenerative disease .

extrahepatic portal venous obstruction , although rare in the western world , is a common cause of major and life threatening upper gastrointestinal bleeding among the poor in developing countries . 
 patients have large spleens and stunted growth . the diagnosis is easily confirmed by doppler ultrasonography . 
 endoscopy sclerotherapy is the best option for the control of acute variceal bleeding . for secondary prophylaxis of bleeding 
 , the choice lies between repeated sclerotherapy and a portosystemic shunt . 
 we believe that due consideration should be given to performing a splenectomy and a lienorenal shunt . 
 performed by experienced surgeons , it carries a low operative mortality of 1% , a rebleeding rate of about 10% , removes the large spleen , reverses hypersplenism , and is not followed by portosystemic encephalopathy . 
 most importantly , it is a onetime procedure particularly suited to those who have little access to blood transfusion and sophisticated medical facilities .

it has been reported that the inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( dpp-4)/cd26 on t - cells by dpp-4 enzymatic inhibitors suppresses lymphocyte proliferation and reduces the production of various cytokines , including tumor necrosis factor ( tnf)-. a 72-year - old female with diabetic nephropathy on hemodialysis developed multiple lung nodules following the administration of vildagliptin . 
 a biopsy demonstrated the histology of granulomas without caseous necrosis . 
 the discontinuation of vildagliptin resulted in the disappearance of the granulomas within 4 months . 
 as granulomatosis often develops in patients under anti - tnf- therapy , the accumulation of dpp-4 inhibitors or its metabolites is possibly linked to unrecognized complications , such as sarcoid - like lung granulomas .

this paper aims to highlight the importance of exercise in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) and to demonstrate the multitude of beneficial effects that properly designed exercise training has in this population . 
 ra is a chronic , systemic , autoimmune disease characterised by decrements to joint health including joint pain and inflammation , fatigue , increased incidence and progression of cardiovascular disease , and accelerated loss of muscle mass , that is , 
 rheumatoid cachexia . 
 these factors contribute to functional limitation , disability , comorbidities , and reduced quality of life . 
 exercise training for ra patients has been shown to be efficacious in reversing cachexia and substantially improving function without exacerbating disease activity and is likely to reduce cardiovascular risk . 
 thus , all ra patients should be encouraged to include aerobic and resistance exercise training as part of routine care . 
 understanding the perceptions of ra patients and health professionals to exercise is key to patients initiating and adhering to effective exercise training .

 abstractbackgroundsubstantial increases in dietary sugar intake together with the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide , as well as the parallels found between sugar overconsumption and drug abuse , have motivated research on the adverse effects of sugars on health and eating behaviour . 
 given that the gut brain axis depends on multiple interactions between peripheral and central signals , and because these signals are interdependent , it is crucial to have a holistic view about dietary sugar effects on health.methodsrecent data on the effects of dietary sugars ( i.e. sucrose , glucose , and fructose ) at both peripheral and central levels and their interactions will be critically discussed in order to improve our understanding of the effects of sugars on health and diseases . 
 this will contribute to the development of more efficient strategies for the prevention and treatment for obesity and associated co-morbidities.resultsthis review highlights opposing effects of glucose and fructose on metabolism and eating behaviour . 
 peripheral glucose and fructose sensing may influence eating behaviour by sweet - tasting mechanisms in the mouth and gut , and by glucose - sensing mechanisms in the gut . 
 glucose may impact brain reward regions and eating behaviour directly by crossing the blood brain barrier , and indirectly by peripheral neural input and by oral and intestinal sweet

objectivethe aims of this study were to examine whether a passive stretch stimulus by means of a functional appliance induces changes in the fiber composition of masticatory muscles and whether these changes are similar to the changes in stretched limb muscle fibers by using rt - pcr , western blot , and immunohistochemical assays.methodsfive male new zealand white rabbits were fitted with a prefabricated inclined plane on the maxillary central incisors to force the mandible forward ( - 2 mm ) and downward ( - 4 mm ) . 
 further , 1 hind limb was extended and constrained with a cast so that the extensor digitorum longus ( edl ) was stretched when the animal used the limb . 
 the animals were sacrificed after 1 week and the masseter , lateral pterygoid , and edl were processed and compared with those from control animals ( n = 3).resultsthe stretched edl had a significantly higher percentage of slow fibers , whereas the stretched masticatory muscles did not show changes in the composition of the major contractile proteins after 7 days.conclusionsthe transition of fiber phenotypes in response to a stretch stimulus may take longer in the masticatory muscles than in the limb muscles .

backgroundconserved domains in proteins have crucial roles in protein interactions , dna binding , enzyme activity and other important cellular processes 
 . it will be of interest to determine the proportions of genes containing such domains in the proteomes of different eukaryotes.resultsthe average proportion of conserved domains in each of five eukaryote genomes was calculated . in pairwise genome comparisons , 
 the ratio of genes containing a given conserved domain in the two genomes on average reflected the ratio of the predicted total gene numbers of the two genomes . 
 these ratios have been verified using a repository of databases and one of its subdivisions of conserved domains.conclusionsmany conserved domains occur as a constant proportion of proteome size across the five sequenced eukaryotic genomes . 
 this raises the possibility that this proportion is maintained because of functional constraints on interacting domains . 
 the universality of the ratio in the five eukaryotic genomes attests to its potential importance .

lincosamides are a class of antibiotics used both in clinical and veterinary practice for a wide range of pathogens . 
 this group of drugs inhibits the activity of the bacterial ribosome by binding to the 23s rna of the large ribosomal subunit and blocking protein synthesis . 
 currently , three x - ray structures of the ribosome in complex with clindamycin are available in the protein data bank , which reveal that there are two distinct conformations of the pyrrolidinyl propyl group of the bound clindamycin . in this work , we used quantum mechanical methods to investigate the probable conformations of clindamycin in order to explain the two binding modes in the ribosomal 23s rna . 
 we studied three lincosamide antibiotics : clindamycin , lincomycin , and pirlimycin at the b3lyp level with the 6 - 31 g * * basis set . 
 the focus of our work was to connect the conformational landscape and electron densities of the two clindamycin conformers found experimentally with their physicochemical properties .

abstractangiogenesis inhibition has been proposed as a general strategy to fight cancer . however , in spite of the promising preclinical results , a first generation of antiangiogenic compounds yielded poor results in clinical trials . 
 conceptual errors and mistakes in the design of trials and in the definition of clinical end - points could account for these negative results . in this context of discouraging results , 
 a second generation of antiangiogenic therapies is showing positive results in phases ii and iii trials at the beginning of the twenty - first century . 
 in fact , several combined treatments with conventional chemotherapy and antiangiogenic compounds have been recently approved . 
 the discovery and pharmacological development of future generations of angiogenesis inhibitors will benefit from further advances in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in human angiogenesis . 
 new styles of trials are necessary , to avoid missing potential therapeutic effects . 
 different clinical end - points , new surrogate biomarkers and methods of imaging will be helpful in this process .

when first introduced , percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy ( pdt ) was performed using a bronchoscope . 
 the bronchoscope itself , however , has several disadvantages , including interruption of ventilation . 
 modifications of the standard pdt technique have suggested that pdt can be safely performed without a bronchoscope . 
 however , the safety of these modifications is unclear and many modifications have yet to be widely adopted . 
 this study retrospectively evaluated the safety of a simplified pdt technique using the cook ciaglia blue rhino in 186 patients . after confirming the underlying structures by palpation 
 , pdt was performed without a bronchoscope or blunt dissection , 2.0 cm below the cricothyroid membrane . 
 ultrasonography was used only when palpation was difficult . except for bleeding in three patients with coagulopathy 
 , none of the patients experienced any early or late complications , and there were no deaths related to pdt . 
 these findings confirm that pdt can be safely performed using a simplified technique , which may be useful in situations with limited equipment and medical personnel .

objective : the purpose of this review is to discuss some critical issues of isoflavones protective against the development of prostate cancer ( pca).data sources : data cited in this review were obtained primarily from pubmed and embase from 1975 to 2015.study selection : articles were selected with the search terms isoflavone , phytoestrogen , soy , genistin , and 
 pca.results:isoflavones do not play an important role on prostate - specific antigen levels reduction in pca patients or healthy men . 
 the effect of isoflavones on sex hormone levels and pca risk may be determined by equol converting bacteria in the intestine , specific polymorphic variation and concentrations of isoflavones . 
 the intake of various types of phytoestrogens with lower concentrations in the daily diet may produce synergistic effects against pca . 
 moreover , prostate tissue may concentrate isoflavones to potentially anti - carcinogenic levels . 
 in addition , it is noteworthy that isoflavones may act as an agonist in pca.conclusions:isoflavones play a protective role against the development of pca .

medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of the central nervous system among children . 
 medulloblastoma is an embryonal tumor , of which little is known about the pathogenesis . 
 several efforts have been made to understand the molecular aspects of its tumorigenic pathways ; however , these are poorly understood . 
 microrna ( mirna ) , a type of non - coding short rna , has been proven to be associated with a number of physiological processes and pathological processes of serious diseases , including brain tumors . 
 differentially expressed mirnas serve an important role in numerous types of malignancy . 
 the present study aims to define a differentially expressed set of mirnas in medulloblastoma tumor tissue , compared with normal samples , to improve the understanding of the tumorigenesis . 
 it was identified that 22 mirnas were upregulated and 26 mirnas were downregulated in the tumor tissue compared with the normal group . however , when the medulloblastoma tissue was compared with normal cerebellum tissue , 9 mirnas were identified to be up or downregulated in the tumor samples . 
 the differentially expressed mirnas in the tumor tissue were identified in order

several recent studies have shown differences in the maternal immune milieu at different phases of pregnancy , but most studies have been cross - sectional or of relatively few time points . 
 levels of 42 cytokines were determined using a multiplex bead - based assay on archived serum from a cohort of pregnant women ( n = 16 ) at median of 18 time points tested , from the first trimester through to parturition , per woman . 
 unconditional growth modeling was then used to determine time - dependent changes in levels of these cytokines . 
 macrophage - derived chemokine ( mdc , aka ccl22 ) decreases as pregnancy progresses . 
 il-1 , il-6 , il-8 , il-12p70 , il-13 , il-15 , ip-10 , and flt3-ligand increase as a function of gestational weeks , and ifn2 , il-1ra , il-3 , il-9 , il-12p40 , and soluble cd40 ligand increase as a function of trimester . as 
 pregnancy normally progresses , a maternal shift away from a type 2-biased immune response and toward an inflammatory / counterregulatory response is observed .

backgroundthe theoretical benefits of using antioxidant vitamin supplements to quench oxygen free radicals appear large . 
 high intensity aerobic - type exercise produces oxygen free radicals that can cause damage to lipid membranes ( lipid peroxidation ) that may lead to many problems such as the inactivation of cell membrane enzymes , the progression of degenerative diseases ( cardiovascular disease and cancer ) and lessening of the effectiveness of the immune system . 
 the major function of vitamin e is to work as a chain - breaking antioxidant in a fat soluble environment . 
 little research has examined lipid peroxidation associated with high intensity resistance exercise or possible protective effects of antioxidant supplementation or the effects of training state.resultsthere were no significant group ( trained vs untrained ) or treatment ( vitamin e vs placebo ) effects found between the 4 groups assessed . 
 there was only one significant difference found and that was in the main effect for time ( f = 22.41 , p  ⁇  0.01).conclusionsthe resistance exercise test caused a significant increase in malondialdehyde in all 4 groups at 6 hours post exercise . 
 there was no evidence that vitamin e supplementation was effective in reducing oxidative damage in comparison to the placebo group .

abstractasthma has been described as an acephalic migraine and pulmonary migraine . 
 however , no study has investigated the temporal frequency of migraine development in patients with asthma , and the results of previous studies may be difficult to generalize.we investigated the effect of asthma on the subsequent development of migraine by using a population - based data set in taiwan.we retrieved our study sample from the national health insurance research database . 
 specifically , 25,560 patients aged 12 years and older with newly diagnosed asthma were identified as the asthma group , and 102,238 sex and age - matched patients without asthma were identified as the nonasthma group . 
 cox proportional - hazards regression models were employed to measure the risk of migraine for the asthmatic group compared with that for the nonasthmatic group.the risk of migraine in the asthmatic group was 1.45-fold higher ( 95% confidence interval 1.331.59 ) than that in the nonasthmatic group after adjustment for sex , age , the charlson comorbidity index , common medications prescribed for patients with asthma , and annual outpatient department visits . 
 an additional stratified analysis revealed that the risk of migraine remained significantly higher in both sexes and all age groups older

segmental copy - number variations ( cnvs ) may contribute to genetic variation in humans . 
 reports 
 of the existence and characteristics of cnvs in a large japanese cohort are quite limited . 
 we report the data from a large japanese population . 
 
 we conducted population screening for 213 unrelated japanese individuals using comparative genomic hybridization based on a bacterial artificial 
 chromosome microarray ( bac - acgh ) . 
 we summarize the data by focusing on highly polymorphic cnvs in 5.0% of the individual , 
 since they may be informative for demonstrating the relationships between genotypes and their phenotypes . 
 we found a total of 680 cnvs at 16 
 different bac - regions in the genome . 
 the majority of the polymorphic cnvs presented on bac - clones that overlapped with regions of segmental 
 duplication , and the majority of the polymorphic cnvs observed in this population had been previously reported in other publications . 
 
 some of the cnvs contained genes which might be related to phenotypic heterogeneity among individuals .
