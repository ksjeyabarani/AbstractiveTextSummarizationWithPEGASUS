– Black Americans are more likely than whites to suffer from high blood pressure, and a new study suggests that the disparity is due to genetic factors, the New York Times reports. Researchers looked at more than 5,600 people from the Coronary Artery Disease and Lifestyle study, which has tracked nearly 50,000 Americans since the early 1970s. The study's lead author, Dr. John Wood, tells the Times that the genetic factors are "at the root of the problem," and that the condition is worse among blacks than among whites. He says the condition is caused by a lack of angiotensin II, a hormone that helps the heart's heart beat more slowly. The authors found that among people with high blood pressure who also have an angiotensin II deficiency, the risk of heart failure is 10 times higher. The researchers also looked at genetic variants that affect the production of a protein that helps the heart beat. They found that among people with both angiotensin II and angiotensin II deficiency, the risk of heart failure was 10 times higher. The authors say that while the findings are not a cause-and-effect, the finding is a "step forward in understanding the association between hypertension and heart failure." (High blood pressure is the No

– A new study suggests that men who eat a lot of tomatoes may be at a higher risk for prostate cancer. Researchers looked at more than 85,000 men in Sweden, and found that those who ate a lot of tomatoes had a 9% higher risk of getting the disease, the Guardian reports. The men who ate a lot of tomatoes had a 16% higher risk of getting the disease than did those who ate a lot of other foods, like strawberries, carrots, and onions. The findings, published in the British Medical Journal, don't mean that men should stop eating tomatoes, but they do suggest that men who ate a lot of tomatoes should get screened. The researchers say that the main factor in the link is the carotenoids in tomatoes, which are known to have anti-inflammatory properties. (A previous study suggested that men who ate a lot of onions were less likely to get prostate cancer.)

– It's a big deal when a person with hepatitis C has normal levels of a liver enzyme called alanine aminotransferase. But when that enzyme is elevated, as in the case of this man, it can lead to serious health problems, including liver failure. So researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago set out to find out why, and they report in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine that elevated alanine aminotransferase is associated with a much higher risk of liver failure in people with chronic hepatitis C. They reviewed the medical records of more than 1,200 people with chronic hepatitis C who had liver biopsies. They found that people with elevated alanine aminotransferase were more likely to have advanced fibrosis, which is caused by excessive inflammation, than those with normal levels. "We were surprised by the magnitude of the difference," one researcher tells the New York Times. "It was shocking." The study found that people with elevated alanine aminotransferase were twice as likely to have liver failure, and they were also more likely to have multiple liver failures. The study's results should be a warning to doctors, but it's not clear how much of a risk this poses, reports the Los Angeles Times. The best guess is that people with high levels of the enzyme will have a harder time

– A woman in the Philippines has become the first known person in the world to contract HIV through blood transfusions, and researchers are trying to figure out how she got it. The woman, identified only as Jane, was in her 40s and had not been using any kind of contraception during the time she was infected, reports the BBC. She was given blood to donate to a patient at a hospital in December, and when researchers asked her why she had not given blood before, she said she had been using a condom at the time. The researchers reviewed records from hospitals in the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia, and found that in all but one of them, the blood was obtained from a commercial donor and delivered to a patient using a blood-buying vendor. The blood was screened for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus, but the HIV risk was low because the virus is in the blood of healthy people, not those who have sex with HIV-positive people. Jane's case is being investigated, but researchers say the blood likely came from a donor who had been using a condom at the time.

– Scientists have figured out a way to use artificial intelligence to study the human body, and it's a pretty nifty one. The technique, which the researchers call "torque," searches for proteins in the body to find similar ones that match known proteins in other species, reports the BBC. It's a "holy grail" for studying diseases, says a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved with the work. "It's a pretty powerful tool." The researchers found that it can identify proteins from different species that are related to a disease more than three times faster than existing methods, reports the BBC. The technique could help researchers identify the exact genes responsible for a disease, say, or figure out how a particular drug works. "It's a pretty powerful tool that's going to help a lot of researchers, especially those who are studying diseases, to find the exact genes responsible for the disease," says a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.

– A 32-year-old man in India who developed a psychosis after taking the drug disulfiram for five years was finally able to kick his alcohol habit—but he's not out of the woods yet. The drug, which is used to treat alcohol dependence, can cause other side effects, including loss of memory, confusion, and mania with psychotic symptoms, according to a study published in the BMJ. In this case, the man's symptoms improved after he stopped taking the drug and took the drug replacement drug lorazepam, which is free of side effects. The study says the man's family history of schizophrenia, impaired liver function, and previous alcohol use were all possible risk factors for his psychosis. The man's symptoms improved after he stopped taking disulfiram and took lorazepam, which is "without any additional requirement of anti- psychotic treatment," the study says. (This man developed a rare form of dementia after taking the drug for years.)

– The discovery of bedbugs in Argentina has led to a wave of horror stories, including one in which a mother who had just given birth to twins was found dead in her bed. Now researchers say they've found a way to stop the spread of bedbugs in the country, the BBC reports. They bred bedbugs in a lab that had been previously infected with deltamethrin, an insecticide commonly used to kill bedbugs. The bedbugs, which had been fed a blood meal from a pigeon, were then exposed to the same amount of deltamethrin every day for eight years. The insects, which had been raised in a lab colony without bedbugs, didn't die after exposure and were resistant to the insecticide. "This is the first time that bedbugs are resistant to a widely used insecticide," the lead researcher says. "We were surprised." The discovery could help stop the spread of bedbugs in Argentina, which has the highest per-capita mortality rate in the world, the BBC notes. The World Health Organization recommends people use bedbugs as a last resort when dealing with infestations. ( bedbugs in the US have also been found in Argentina.)

– Women who suffer a distal radius fracture—a bone fracture that runs from the middle of the forearm to the elbow—have a higher risk of osteoporosis than women who don't break a bone, according to a new study. Researchers from South Korea found that women with a distal radius fracture had a bone density of 88.8 grams per deciliter of blood, compared to 106.8 grams in women without a distal radius fracture. The bone density of women without a distal radius fracture was lower at 81.1 grams per deciliter of blood, reports LiveScience. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, also found that the risk of osteoporosis in these women was higher than in women without a distal radius fracture. "Our results suggest that osteoporosis in postmenopausal Korean women is associated with a lower bone density, possibly because the bone density of the distal radius fracture is lower than in the normal bone density of the general population," the researchers say. They also found that the bone density of these women was lower than in women with osteoporosis, but not in women without osteoporosis. The researchers say that women with a distal radius fracture should be checked for osteoporosis before breaking a bone, and that women with a distal radius fracture should see a doctor if bone density is low.

– A new study suggests that a chemical found in red blood cells could be linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The mechanism is called srage, and it's found in red blood cells and is known to be protective against diabetes. But researchers at Kuwait's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum Medical University report in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine that it may also be linked to prediabetes, which is a condition that develops in early adulthood and can be hard to reverse. They found that people with low levels of srage were more likely to develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, reports the New York Times. The researchers say their study is the first to show a link between srage and the development of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. They found that people with low levels of srage were more likely to have low levels of an enzyme called IgM-B-in, which is linked to anger and inflammation, reports the Times. The researchers say their findings suggest that people with low levels of srage may be able to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by taking steps to improve their immune system. (A new drug could help prevent type 2 diabetes.)

– A new lens that's been used for years to correct astigmatism after cataract surgery is showing promise in the eyes of patients who've had the procedure for years, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology. The acrysof toric iol lens, which was approved by the FDA in 2005, is a single-photon lens that's placed in the eye through a small incision and then slowly absorbed into the eye through an acrysof-toric lens ring. The acrysof-toric lens is about the size of a golf ball and has a unique shape that allows it to be placed in the eye at just the right time to correct for spherical and astigmatic astigmatism, according to a press release. The study involved 18 patients who had the surgery between 2008 and 2012, and found that they had a 50% improvement in their vision after six months. "The results are really exciting," the study's lead author tells the New York Times. "It's a huge step forward." The acrysof-toric lens is currently used to treat people who had cataracts, but it's not clear whether it will be used to treat people with glaucoma, or whether it will be used to treat people who have

– A 61-year-old Brazilian man died of a very rare bladder cancer just two months after undergoing a radical cystectomy, which removed most of his bladder, the Telegraph reports. The patient, who had been suffering from hematuria and hypogastric pain for a year, was diagnosed with small cell carcinoma of the bladder, which is extremely rare and aggressive and accounts for less than 1% of all bladder tumors. The patient had chemotherapy, but doctors were not optimistic because the tumor had spread to the lymph nodes in his abdomen and was not localized. They decided to remove the entire bladder instead of chemotherapy, which would have required the patient to undergo radiation. The patient died four months after the surgery, and doctors report in the journal Bladder that the aggressive form of bladder cancer is very difficult to manage because it presents in the same way as other bladder tumors and has a poor prognosis. The patient had a very short life expectancy after the surgery, and doctors say that because the tumor was so advanced, chemotherapy was the best course of action.

– A rare condition known as phakomatosis pigmentovascularis is a rare genetic disorder in which a person's skin turns a bright red or blue, reports the New York Times. In this case, a 13-year-old girl in Japan had a wine stain on her face, leg, and back, and a CT scan revealed the disorder. It's so rare that the Japanese Medical Association didn't report it until this year, but it's not hard to figure out what's going on. The disorder can occur in any part of the body, and the girl in this case had it on her face, chest, and lower leg. The condition is so rare that it's called "twin spotting," and the New York Times explains that it can occur both in the eyes and the brain. The condition is so rare that it's called "double spotting," and the Times explains that it can occur both in the eyes and the brain at the same time. The condition is so rare that it's called "double spotting syndrome," and the New York Times explains that it's so rare that the condition is known as "twin spotting syndrome." It's not clear what causes the condition, but it can be caused by a

– A new study suggests that a common virus in our intestines may be behind a common form of brain cancer. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center report in the journal PLOS Pathogens that they found the human polyoma virus in the brains of patients who died from medulloblastoma, a rare form of brain cancer. The virus, which lives in our intestines, is known to spread through contact with small animals, such as cows and pigs. The researchers say they've never seen the virus in medulloblastoma brains before, and they caution that their study, which involved brain tissue samples from 31 patients who died with other cancers, is only an "initial step" and needs to be replicated in a larger population. The virus was found in the brains of 16 patients, but researchers say it's possible that it spreads through other means, reports the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. "The presence of the virus in the brain is a new and unexpected finding," the lead researcher says. "It is not a smoking gun, but it is a potential smoking gun." The researchers say the virus is present in most cases of the childhood cancer but is most prevalent in those who have close contact with animals, such as cows and pigs. The tumors are usually very small and hard to

– A common ointment that's been around for decades can fight off a number of antibiotic-resistant infections, but it's not just bacteria that it's effective against. New research finds that bensal hp, a combination of salicylic acid and benzoic acid that's been sold under the generic name Narbesti, is also effective against a number of bacteria and fungal infections, including staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to most antibiotics, the New York Times reports. "This is the first time that topical anti-infectious agents have been shown to be effective against a broad range of bacteria," the lead researcher says in a press release. The ointment is also safe and effective for people of all ages, but it's not a cure-all. "We still don't have a lot of effective agents for certain infections," the researcher says. "We're finding new agents that are more effective." The ointment was tested on 184 bacterial and fungal isolates from around the world, as well as on yeasts and fungi, according to the Times. The results, published in the journal Cell Reports, suggest that "topical anti-infectious agents may be of benefit to people of all ages," the researcher says. (A new

– It's a hip surgery that's been around for a while, but it's only been recently that it's being used to treat the most common cause of disability among professional athletes: a torn labral (the part of the hip that cushions the joint) that causes the hip to twist and impinge on the inside of the femur (the part that connects the femur to the tibia). And now, a team of researchers out of the University of Bath in England has found that the best treatment for this problem is to have the inside of the femur (and the acetabulum, which is attached to the femur) surgically separated. The researchers report in the journal PLoS ONE that the surgery, which they call "the first of its kind in the world," is a simple operation that requires no surgery at all and can return the patient to "high-level" activities within six weeks. The team looked at 45 professional athletes who had developed the condition, and found that only five had the condition that required surgery, and only after conservative treatment for only six weeks. The researchers say that the surgery is a safe and effective treatment for these athletes, and that it's not just for those who play sports. "These are the people who are going to be the

– A new study has found that one in five kids in Iran is malnourished, and researchers are calling for action to tackle the problem. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at 902 children under the age of 5 in southern Iran. Researchers measured their height, weight, and arm circumference and found that 1 in 4 were underweight, 1 in 5 were overweight, and 1 in 6 were wasted, LiveScience reports. "We have to start from the bottom," says the lead researcher. "Malnutrition is a major public health problem in Iran and the world." The country has some of the highest rates of underweight, stunting, wasting, and obesity in the world, according to the CDC. In Iran, obesity has increased from 4.2% in 1990 to 6.7% in 2010, and is expected to reach 9.1% by 2020.

– A rare genetic disorder was successfully treated in a 5-year-old boy in Spain, but the condition may have long-term consequences for his brain and spinal cord, Live Science reports. The boy was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1, or nf-1, which is a "progressive disorder" that causes abnormal growths of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The condition is extremely rare, affecting just one in 2,500 people, according to a study published in the journal Neurology. nf-1 is 10% to 20% rarer than nf-1, and the boy in this case had an extra calvarial nerve sheath that stretched from his head to his neck. The condition can cause a wide range of symptoms, including pain, headache, and facial paralysis. The boy was treated with a steroid injection and a bone marrow transplant, but doctors say the long-term consequences of nf-1 are unclear. "The fact that it is a progressive disorder and that almost 50% of cases are sporadic mutations multiplies its clinical magnitude several folds," the researchers write. They say the condition is most commonly found in men, but it can be found in women. The boy's parents were not tested for nf-1 and were not diagnosed with the disorder. "The parents are very worried because

– A 59-year-old woman in Spain is alive three years after doctors removed a melanoma from her right breast, Live Science reports. According to a study published in the British Medical Journal, the woman had a black pigmented lesion that had been growing rapidly and bleeding for years. It was located in the upper inner quadrant of her right breast, not associated with any breast mass. Doctors say the woman's skin was black with a dark color that would be consistent with a pigmented tumor. The tumor was removed with a wide-ranging biopsy that included searching for any metastatic melanoma that might have moved to the woman's lymph nodes. The woman is now cancer-free. While the incidence of malignant melanoma has risen in recent years, it is rare for it to occur in the breast. According to the study, the woman was not at risk because she was not exposed to the sun. The study states the woman's skin was black with a dark color that would be consistent with a pigmented tumor. While the woman was not at risk because she was not exposed to the sun, doctors say the woman's case shows the importance of sunscreen. According to the study, the woman was given the cancer treatment trental therapy, which fights the cancer by attacking its cells.

– Scientists have taken a big step toward developing a cancer treatment that could be used to treat millions of people—including those who have lost a loved one to cancer. Reporting in the journal Nature, researchers say they've successfully grown human embryos in a culture that has been irradiated with high doses of radiation and found that the embryos developed into tissue that resembles cancer. "It's like having a person who has been given a very specific set of genes and then you take those genes and alter them in a way that's very specific to the cancer," says lead researcher Dr. Supat Thammasitboon of the University of Maryland. "You can actually alter them in a way that's very specific to the cancer." The researchers say that by altering the genes, they were able to differentiate human embryos into cancer cells, reports the BBC. The development could help scientists figure out how to treat cancer and other diseases more quickly and cheaply than with chemotherapy, reports the New York Times. The researchers say that in the future, they could use the embryos to develop treatments for a wide range of diseases, including breast cancer, and perhaps even cancer itself.

– A new study suggests that doctors may be able to spot a painful joint infection much earlier than previously believed. periprosthetic joint infection, or pji, is a complication of total joint infection that can lead to joint deformity, permanent loss of an implant, and even death, reports the New York Times. Until now, doctors have been using a variety of tests to diagnose the infection, including blood tests, CT scans, and MRIs. But a new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine suggests that a simple blood test can spot the infection much earlier, and it's based on the idea that the immune system attacks the infection. The study looked at nine studies involving more than 5,600 patients and found that the simple blood test—called a hematological test—could spot the infection in as little as 30 minutes, compared to the four to eight hours it would take with other tests, including a serum test, reports the Los Angeles Times. "This is a big breakthrough," says the lead author. "It's a very simple test that's very sensitive and easy to interpret." The study's results could have big implications for doctors, especially in treating patients with painful joint infections. The American Academy of orthopedic surgeons published its first guidelines for diagnosing p

– A young woman received a course of chemotherapy for leukemia, and then something happened that caused her eyes to turn blue. It turns out the woman had a rare bacteria on her skin that caused her eyes to turn blue, Live Science reports. The bacteria, which is known to cause eye infections, was identified as Serratia marcescens. It had invaded the woman's conjunctiva, the area of the eye that usually clears up after a visit to the doctor. The condition, which was treated with antibiotics, caused the woman's eyes to turn blue. The case was reported in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology. The woman had been given chemotherapy that included vincristine, prednisolone, daunorubicin, and asparaginase. The bacteria likely entered the woman's eye through her conjunctiva and caused the blue color to turn. The case is unusual because it appears to be the first time such an infection has caused eye problems in a patient given all of those chemo drugs, according to a press release. It's possible the bacteria caused the eye problems by causing superficial erosions, but it's also possible that the woman was immunocompromised and didn't realize she had the bacteria. The woman had surgery to remove the bacteria

– If you're in the market for a new set of teeth-whiteningSmiles, you may want to add ethanol to the mix. A new study suggests that ethanol, when used in high concentrations, can dramatically reduce the microleakage that is a hallmark of dental composite restorations, Popular Science reports. The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, used an ultrasound machine to create a 3D model of teeth and then added ethanol to a bonding agent used to create a thin layer of protection between restorations and tooth tissue. When the tooth was etched with 35% phosphoric acid gel, the water that would normally flow into the enamel wall was pushed out and replaced by ethanol. When the same compound was used with 10%, 30%, and 50% ethanol, the water that would normally flow in was pushed out and replaced by the latter. The researchers found that the concentration of ethanol in the composite adhesive was the best at 30%, while it was less than 10% at 50% and less than 10% at all other levels. "The ethanol-based dental adhesives are superior to the traditional ones in terms of their ability to reduce microleakage," the lead researcher says in a press release. "In fact, the only difference between the two is that the ethanol-based adhesives are more efficient."

– A new study offers a tantalizing clue about how our bodies fight off disease: It may not be our genes that are the problem, but rather our own. The study in Nature Communications zeroes in on a "proteinaceous stromal hitchhiker" in the mammalian genome that's been linked to a wide range of diseases, including arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and asthma. The telltale clue? It turns out that the protein, called hnrnp a2/b1, is " spliced" with another protein, hnrnp b2, reports the New York Times. "It's a completely new perspective on how the body fights off disease," says study co-author Dr. Supat Thammasitboon of the University of Edinburgh. "It's a completely new way of looking at the disease." The finding could help scientists better understand the causes of diseases like arthritis and asthma, and perhaps even point the way to better treatments.

– A new study has identified a gene that makes some bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, the Guardian reports. Researchers at the University of Washington identified the gene, named vga(a)lc, in the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, which causes infections in humans and animals. They found that vga(a)lc is unique in that it confers resistance to at least three common antibiotics, as well as to a class of drugs called macrolides, which are found in a wide range of bacteria. "This is a really important finding," says a researcher. "It's the first time that a gene for an antibiotic has been identified that confers resistance to at least three different antibiotics." The discovery could help researchers develop new antibiotics, but it's not a cure-all. "It's not a magic bullet, but it's a step in the right direction," says a professor at the University of California-San Diego, who wasn't involved in the study. "It's a small step, but it's a step in the right direction." (Another new study has identified the genes behind antibiotic resistance.)

– A leukemia patient who had just begun chemotherapy developed a rare form of pneumonia after the chemo stopped, and doctors say it's a "startling" case. The 51-year-old man, who was treated with the drug ceftazid and an antifungal, developed pneumonia in his lung after the chemo stopped, reports the New York Times. The rare infection is caused by a fungus called pseudozyma aphidis, which is believed to have first appeared in the wild in the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. "This is astartic," says Dr. Kosta Kostov, one of the doctors who wrote about the case in the New England Journal of Medicine. "It's a new and very unusual complication from chemotherapy." The leukemia had metastasized, meaning it had spread to other parts of the body. The pneumonia was caught early, when the patient's white blood cells began to turn white. The leukemia had been in remission before the chemo stopped, but the infection was still a big deal because it was so rare. The patient had no respiratory symptoms, and doctors figured the infection was caused by the fungus in his lung. They treated him with the anti-fungal fluconazole instead of the standard anti-fungal drug pconazole, and discovered the yeast

– A new study suggests that people who are diabetic and have end-stage renal disease are at higher risk of developing a condition called diabetic foot ulcers. The ulcers, which can cause amputations, are caused by a buildup of plaque in the feet, the New York Times reports. They can also lead to infections and other health problems. "This is a major public health problem," says the lead researcher of the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "It's a major complication of dialysis." Researchers at the Hamad General Hospital in Qatar studied more than 5,600 hemodialysis patients who were alive after three months of treatment. They found that those who had foot ulcers were 10 times more likely to die during the study, and those who developed fu were twice as likely to have a major amputation, according to a press release. The study suggests that people who are diabetic and have end-stage renal disease should be evaluated for fu before undergoing dialysis, the Times reports. (A recent study found that people who have Type 2 diabetes are more likely to develop fu.)

– A heart-wrenching story out of China, where a rare genetic mutation has left a woman with a rare and deadly heart condition. The woman, identified only as a single mother, died of a heart attack at age 52, reports the New York Times. She had a genetic mutation of the heart condition, known as primary cardiomyopathy, that was found in a 2008 study of a similar family. The woman had a copy of the gene mutation in her DNA that caused her heart to enlarge when it should be shrinking, reports the BBC. The mother had a heart transplant at age 45, but her condition left her with a rare heart condition called cavernous heart disease that prevented her from getting adequate heart transplant surgery. The woman's story prompted researchers in Shanghai to look into the possibility that the genetic mutation could be passed on to future generations. They found that in a small sample of Asian people, the mutation was present in 6.4% of people, reports the BBC. The researchers say the finding is "inconsistent with our previous observations," but they're not ready to say the mutation is responsible for the heart condition. They did find that the condition is more common in younger people, but they say more research is needed to confirm the findings. (Another recent heart study found that people

– It's not just your boring old gray eye that needs to be treated. A new study published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology reports on the cases of two patients who underwent emergency surgery after their eyes showed signs of a rare and serious eye disorder called pseudophakic inferotemporal detachment. The condition, which is caused by a protein called retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) protein, causes the eye's photoreceptor layer to die, leaving the eye's central vision blank. The study's lead author, Dr. John Wood, tells the New York Times that such detachments are "very rare" and "very rarely" treated. They can occur in any part of the eye, but they're most often found in the retina, which supplies the light needed to see. The study reports on the cases of a 70-year-old man who showed blurry vision for six weeks and a 50-year-old woman who showed no vision for a month and then suddenly showed vision again. The women's cases were treated within 24 hours of diagnosis, according to a press release. The study states that while no cure exists, "in the case of the former, surgery is the best course of action to restore vision." The study states that in these cases, R

– The human eye lens is made up of roughly 35% of the soluble mass of the lens itself, and those proteins are responsible for keeping the lens intact, Popular Science reports. But as we age, those proteins start to deteriorate, and researchers now say they've figured out a way to reverse that damage. The discovery could also help us better understand how our eyes work, and it's a fascinating one in that it involves proteins that are "long-lived," as Popular Science puts it. The proteins are called crystallins, and they're made up of roughly 35% of the lens' soluble mass. As they deteriorate, they become insoluble, and that leads to cell death, which prevents normal protein turnover. Researchers found that by altering the crystallins' activity, they were able to reverse the damage. "It's like a kind of magic bullet," says one of the researchers. "You can reverse the damage that's happening to the lens." The team tested their findings on mice, and found that those who altered the crystallins' activity had cataracts.

– If you're obese and have high blood pressure, you may want to think twice about eating too much during the day. A new study finds that obese women are twice as likely to have high blood pressure as their non-obese counterparts, the New York Times reports. Researchers from South Korea's Insu Jong-dong Hospital found that obese women had a 30% higher risk of having high blood pressure than their non-obese counterparts. "This is the first study to show that the association between obesity and high blood pressure is not only independent of the body mass index, but also of the circadian rhythms," the lead researcher says in a press release. "This could be a mechanism that is important in the development of cardiovascular disease." Researchers found that women who ate a lot of junk food during the day had higher blood pressure than women who ate less. The study was small, with only 441 patients, but researchers say that the findings could be applied to millions of people. (Another recent study found that obese women are more likely to be obese than men.)

– Imagine missing a single tooth. Well, it's possible to do it with a 3D printer. A team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania has created a prototype of a missing tooth using a process called " additive manufacturing," reports the Philadelphia Inquirer. The team used a 3D printer called 3D micro to create a mold of a missing tooth. The result is a replica of the patient's actual tooth that looks much like the real thing. “It’s like having a computer vision of your tooth,” says lead researcher Dr. Joshua Bornemann. “You can have a 3D model of your tooth and have it done in less than an hour.” The process is cheaper and faster than traditional manufacturing, and it allows the dentist to create a more accurate prosthetic tooth. The prototype is being tested in a small number of patients and should be ready for market within a year.

In a case study published in the British Medical Journal, a 19-year-old woman who'd had hair that was "unruly" and "rough" for nearly her entire life was diagnosed with trichonodosis, which is caused by "unusual growth of hair and knots that get caught in combs and brushes," per the study. The woman, who had hair that was dry and curly, had no history of lice or other hair-related issues, doctors say. "This may be spontaneous or secondary to mechanical factors like vigorous scratching or combing the hair," they write. The woman's condition was so severe that doctors had to order a biopsy, which revealed hair that had broken off from the scalp and grown back into the hair shaft. The patient had hair that was "swallowing out of her scalp and falling out of her hair," the doctors say. "The hair was not growing properly, and the knots were difficult to break." The woman, who had hair that was "widely curled and straight," had hair that was "swallowing out of her scalp and falling out of her hair,"

– A drug used to treat multiple sclerosis may actually cause heart failure in some patients, according to a new study. The drug, mitoxantrone, was approved in 2003 for the treatment of patients who had progressed to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, the most severe form of the disease, and who had not responded to other treatments, reports the New York Times. But researchers found that in 30 patients who received low-dose infusions of mitoxantrone for three months or more, the risk of heart failure was almost twice as high as in patients given higher doses of the drug, according to a press release. The patients, aged 23 to 47, were treated with infusions of 12mg/m of mitoxantrone every 30 minutes for 30 minutes for a total of 156mg/m over three months. The researchers say the low-dose infusions may have caused a sudden jump in heart rate that was not expected. The patients also experienced other side effects, including depression and diabetes. The researchers say that the side effects were limited to heart failure because the patients were given only a minimal dose and their condition was not terminal. They say that more research is needed to determine if the side effects are permanent or only temporary. (A recent study found that people with multiple sclerosis can live

– A new drug being tested on cancer patients could help fight a number of the disease's most devastating symptoms, researchers say. The drug, called erenumab, blocks a protein that helps cells produce nerve cells, reports the BBC. It's been tested on mice and humans to treat a variety of diseases, but it has never been tested on humans. "This is the first time that a drug has been shown to block a protein that is critical for the survival of neurons," a researcher tells the New York Times. "It's a huge breakthrough." The drug is being tested on patients with a type of brain cancer known as glioblastoma multiforme, which is the most common form of brain cancer and accounts for more than half of all cancer deaths in the US. erenumab blocks the protein that makes the cells produce nerve cells, called pr2a, and it has been shown to be effective in treating glioblastoma. Other diseases with a high risk of pr2a include Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, and researchers say the drug could be used to treat other neurodegenerative diseases as well. (A new drug could fight breast cancer.)

– Vitamin d can help fend off the effects of fatty liver disease, but it's not as easy as taking a pill every day. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers in Iran report that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who took vitamin d supplements enjoyed significant benefits over those who took a placebo. The researchers say that in addition to reducing inflammation, vitamin d may also help control cholesterol, which is a risk factor for NAFD. The study involved 60 patients who were diagnosed with NAFD between the ages of 30 and 70. After 10 weeks of taking vitamin d supplements or a placebo, there was a 24% reduction in inflammation in the vitamin d-treated group compared to the placebo group, reports Live Science. The researchers say that the results suggest that vitamin d could help treat NAFD by reducing the body's ability to process cholesterol. But they caution that more research is needed to confirm the results and that vitamin d should be used in combination with other treatments, such as liver transplants, reports the New York Times. (NAFLD is the leading cause of liver failure in the US.)

– Men who suffer from benign prostate hyperplasia (BPE) may be in for a surprise: A new study finds that men who undergo laser prostate surgery are as safe as men who have standard turp surgery, the New York Times reports. The surgery uses a laser to remove tissue from the prostate, a procedure that takes about five hours and requires a resident's training. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found that the death rate from turp is just 1.1%, compared to 11.1% for those who have the laser procedure. The researchers also found that the death rate from BPE is much lower than the 0.2% seen in the earlier generation of turp, which has a learning curve of 50 to 100 cases, according to a press release. The study looked at 532 men over the age of 50 who had BPE and were not already receiving hormone therapy. Of the 422 who had standard turp, just one died, compared to 16 in the laser group. The researchers also found that the laser procedure was safer than turp for both men and women. "The finding is very reassuring," says a lead author of the study. "We were able to show that the laser procedure is as safe as the standard turp procedure."

– A 66-year-old man who presented with shortness of breath and abdominal pain ended up dying of a rare lung condition that doctors say is caused by a genetic disorder, the New York Times reports. The man had a rare genetic disorder called primary myelofibrosis, which affects one in every 200,000 people. The disorder causes red blood cells to grow uncontrollably in the body. When those cells reach the lungs, they cause a buildup of mucus called pulmonary hypertension. The condition can lead to heart attacks and strokes, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The man's doctors say his condition was so severe that he couldn't walk or eat normally, and he suffered from heart failure and lung infections. A CT scan showed no abnormality in his lungs, but when doctors discovered the condition, they found a buildup of white blood cells and a buildup of a protein called T-cells in the lungs. The T-cells are able to get to the lungs and help fight off the disease. The man died of pulmonary hypertension, which is caused by an increase in the body's production of T-cells. The man's death is one of the most unusual cases of pulmonary hypertension ever reported. “This is a very rare and unusual disease,” the

– Scientists have discovered a new way to fight cancer, but it's not a simple pill. Instead, it involves taking a drug called etoposide that blocks a protein that's critical for the body to make new cells, the Guardian reports. The discovery is a "big deal," a researcher says, because it's the first time a drug has been shown to fight cancer in humans. "It's a huge breakthrough," he says. "It's like taking a cancer drug and giving it to a cancer patient." The drug, which is currently being tested in the US, blocks a protein called rnf8, which is critical for the body to make new cells. When it's taken out, the protein no longer makes new cells, and the old ones are destroyed. The discovery could lead to better treatment for cancer, the Guardian notes, because it will prevent cells from dividing again and from mutating. The drug is currently being tested in the US on mice, the BBC reports, and it's expected to be ready for clinical trials in a few years.

– A man in Spain is alive today because his oral cancer was caught early, say doctors. The case of the 48-year-old, who suffered from pain in his upper right gums and had swelling in his jaw, was reported in the British Medical Journal. A CT scan revealed a tumor about the size of a grapefruit, but doctors removed it because it had spread to the bone below, reports the New York Times. They say it was a particularly rare form of oral melanoma, which is caused by uncontrolled growth of melanin, and they hope their case will raise awareness. "It's a good reminder that early detection is key to a good prognosis," the lead author of the report tells the Times. The cancer was removed 11 months after the initial diagnosis, and the man is now cancer-free. (Click to read about a man who died of a rare form of skin cancer.)

– Cat owners who've suffered from macular degeneration may be in luck: A team of researchers says it has found a way to stop the disease in its tracks, the BBC reports. The researchers say they've genetically modified a type of cat tissue that produces retinal cells and that they've found a way to stop them from dividing into retinosa pigmentosa cells, which are the ones that cause macular degeneration. The researchers say they've been able to stop the cells from dividing, and they've also been able to use a gene therapy to stop them from dividing. The development is a big deal because the degeneration—which causes blindness in older people—is so common, the Telegraph reports. "It's a huge breakthrough," says a professor at the University of California-San Francisco who wasn't involved with the study. "It's a completely new approach to treat this disease." The researchers say the treatment would work by stopping the cells from dividing. They used a gene-editing technique to alter the cells' DNA, then injected them into the retinas of mice. The mice who received the treatment showed no sign of the disease after five years, and the researchers say it could work in humans as well. (Another big breakthrough in the field:

– A 71-year-old man who went to the doctor with "dilative cardiomiopathy" and elevated blood pressure was ultimately diagnosed with a rare and deadly liver disease, doctors say. The condition is called biliary hamartoma, which is a benign congenital malformation of the biliary duct, Live Science reports. "It is a very rare condition," Dr. Kosta Kostov of the University of Krakow tells the Telegraph. "It is very difficult to diagnose this disease in the early stages." The man's symptoms included jaundice, and when doctors started examining him, they found a mass of lesions with comet- tail echoes in his bile ducts. They also found a buildup of fat in his liver, which led to a biopsy that revealed the disease. "The fat buildup is not the only thing that can lead to this condition," Kostov says. "It is also possible that the comet- tail echoes are the result of the liver’s own immune system attacking the fat." The man is now recovering. (This man had to have a liver transplant after his wife died.)

– A Brazilian law that bans same-sex marriage is making it harder for gay men to get health care and a job, the Guardian reports. A law that went into effect in March bans gay couples from getting married and makes it a crime for same-sex partners to have sex without telling each other. The law was passed in a surprise move by President Michel Temer, who has been trying to reform his nation's laws since taking office in 2009. But gay rights advocates say the law is just the latest in a long line of discriminatory laws that have kept many gay people from accessing health care and jobs. "The law is a violation of their rights, and it is also an attack on the rights of those who are HIV-positive," a researcher tells the Guardian. A survey of more than 85,000 Brazilians found that 17.2% of men and women have HIV, and 1 in 4 of them are living with the disease, the New York Times reports. The law is "an attack on the rights of people with HIV to live as they choose," a researcher says. "It is an attack on the rights of people with HIV to be treated as human beings." Brazil is one of just six countries in the world that ban same-sex marriage,

– A new study finds that nearly half of nursing homes in the US are over-prescribing drugs—and it's not just because they're prescribed to treat certain diseases. The study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, also found that many of the elderly patients admitted to the homes were receiving too many drugs, with an estimated 45.6% of them over-prescribing them. The study's lead author, Dr. Nancy Avis, tells the New York Times that the problem is that many elderly patients are prescribed drugs for chronic diseases, but they're also given drugs to treat acute illnesses. "They're taking a lot of drugs that don't have the intended effect," she says. "They're taking things that have no intended effect, and they're giving them to people who have no intention of taking them." Avis tells the Times that the problem is that many elderly patients are prescribed drugs for multiple diseases, and they often receive both types of drugs at the same time. The study found that patients who received both types of drugs were more likely to suffer side effects, including heart attacks and strokes, than patients who received only one of the two. The study also found that elderly patients who received both types of drugs were more likely to

– A 4-year-old boy in India is dead after a rare condition that causes a build-up of blood in his spleen, the BBC reports. The boy was found unresponsive in his bedroom on Sunday, and doctors immediately performed a CT scan, which revealed the condition: extrahepatic portal venous obstruction, or ehpvo. It's the most common cause of bleeding in children in India, and is thought to be caused by a buildup of blood in the portal vein that ultimately reaches the boy's abdomen. The condition can also be caused by cirrhosis of the liver, but researchers say the boy's death is the first known fatality from ehpvo in India. The cause of the build-up of blood in the spleen is still unclear, but it can occur at any time during a child's life. Doctors say the boy's symptoms began a few days before his death, and they suspected the condition when he started vomiting blood and had diarrhea. They performed a CT scan and found the blood buildup, which led to the diagnosis. Doctors say the boy will need to undergo a liver transplant, but the condition is often fatal, and the best treatment is to treat it surgically, which can be time-consuming and has a mortality rate of 1%

– A man in his 50s who went to the doctor complaining of a fast heartbeat ended up having a successful heart procedure that left him "alive and well," doctors report in the New England Journal of Medicine. The case is unusual in that the patient had arheumatic heart disease, meaning the heart muscle was not making enough money to maintain a normal heart rate. Doctors inserted two balloons into his left heart and inflated the mitral valve, which helps control the amount of blood flowing to the heart. The balloons inflated normally, but when they were removed, they punctured his heart, reports Live Science. The doctors say the patient was conscious for three days and suffered no neurological problems. They say the procedure, which involved opening the man's heart, was a success. "It's a very unusual case, but it's not unheard of," the lead author of the report says. "It's a good reminder that we need to be aware of our heart rate." The man's case is described in a press release as a "medical mystery" because the balloons didn't inflate properly. The man's condition is so rare that the American Heart Association recommends only about three such procedures per year. (A woman who had a successful heart procedure ended up having

– Men and women in the United Arab Emirates are more likely to develop metabolic syndrome than women in the US, according to a new study. The condition, which doubles the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is characterized by a buildup of fat on the body. Researchers found that among nearly 3,000 men and women in the UAE, those who were obese but healthy at the start of the study were more likely to develop the condition than those who were overweight but not healthy at the end of the study, the BBC reports. "We were surprised by the finding," says the lead researcher. "We thought we would find a link between obesity and mes, but we were surprised to find that it was the women who were more likely to develop mes." The condition is caused by a buildup of fat on the body, including in the abdomen, and can be treated with diet and exercise, but the researchers say more research is needed to determine whether a specific treatment is needed. (In other morbid obesity news, a man who died of cancer was found to have a genetic variant linked to obesity.)

– It's not just doctors who need to be better at writing prescriptions. A new study suggests that they should be taught to write prescriptions using actual patients. Researchers at Indiana University Bloomington asked medical students to write prescriptions for five real patients—apeptic ulcer, bronchial asthma, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus—in a format that allowed them to reference the patient's clinical conditions and write prescriptions based on those conditions, the researchers write in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. The students in the control group were taught the same techniques, but the students in the study were taught a different method: They were given a 10-minute lesson on the conditions and had to write prescriptions. The students in the control group scored higher on their prescriptions than the students in the study who were taught the techniques, but the difference was less than the researchers expected. "This intervention may improve prescribing skills since the learning occurs within the context of real patients and is easier to recall," the researchers write. They found that the techniques worked best when used with patients who were actually suffering from the conditions the students were studying. (A doctor who gave birth to twins was found to have a genetic mutation that makes her more likely to give birth to premature babies.)

– A deadly strain of tuberculosis that emerged in Washington state in 2004 was brought about by a small circle of pot smokers who kept the disease at bay by covering up their smokes, researchers report in the journal Scientific Reports. Eight people who contracted the Mycobacterium tuberculosis—a bacteria typically found in soil and water—were born in Africa and had lived in the US since at least 2001, according to the CDC. All had a history of drug use, and many smoked pot in cars or in one another's homes, reports the New York Times. Researchers say they found that many of the people who smoked with the patients were friends, and that the risk of getting TB from them was almost twice as high as from others. The outbreak was traced to a single apartment in Seattle's Lake Union neighborhood, where the patients stayed for at least 31 days after they contracted the disease. The apartment's occupants nailed boards over the windows to hide the smell of marijuana smoke from outsiders, and many of the friends who stayed there were also among the patients who smoked in cars or in their homes. Researchers say the spread of TB from people who are using or have had marijuana is extremely rare, and they recommend that anyone who develops TB get it as soon as they can. (In California, a

– A particularly dangerous superbug is evolving so quickly that doctors are having to change the way they treat patients, the New York Times reports.methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or mrsa, is resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin, which is used to treat about half of all infections in the US. The Times notes that the superbug is resistant to a class of antibiotics called lactam antibiotics, which are only found in the US and are only given to people with certain conditions. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found that seven out of eight strains of mrsa found in a hospital in Malaysia were resistant to vancomycin. "It's a big deal because it means that we're not getting the right treatment for the right time," the lead researcher tells the Times. "It's a big problem." The researchers say that in the future, doctors should stop giving patients lactam antibiotics and give them to people with more severe infections.

– A 70-year-old woman who was taking a drug used to treat Type 2 diabetes ended up dying of lung cancer, and doctors are warning that the unusual side effects of the drug may be a sign of a broader problem. The woman had been taking the drugvildagliptin, which is taken twice daily, for more than three years when she developed severe kidney failure and needed to undergo dialysis. She was given the drug, which blocks the protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4, in 2011, but after four months, her lung lesions began to grow, and a biopsy revealed multiple lesions, without any evidence of tuberculosis. The woman died in April, and doctors say the cause is unclear, but they suspect the drug caused the tumors. "The mechanism by which it triggered the immune system to attack the lung is not clear," the lead author of a report in the New England Journal of Medicine tells the BBC. "It could be that the immune system was under attack by bacteria or fungi." The woman had no pets, no history of tuberculosis, and no severe allergies. The New York Times reports that the drug is approved for use in Type 2 diabetes, but it's taken off the market in the last few years because of side effects, including heart attacks and strokes

– Japan has seen its first fatal case of enterovirus-68 this year, and researchers are now saying the virus is behind the deaths. The virus killed a 7-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl, and sickened dozens of other people, the AP reports. The cause is unclear, but researchers say it appears to be a new strain that emerged in the country that is similar to the strain that killed a 6-year-old girl in 1998. The new strain has no known link to other illnesses, and no one is sure why the children died, but researchers say it looks like the enterovirus is behind the deaths. "This is the first time we've seen a fatal enterovirus-68 infection in Japan," a researcher tells the New York Times. "We were surprised." The virus causes respiratory illness in humans, but it's usually fatal. The cause of the deaths hasn't been determined.

– An 86-year-old woman in Brazil is recovering from a rare surgery that saved her life, but doctors say she's not alone. The Herald Sun reports the woman was admitted to a hospital in the city of Aracruz three days ago after she began vomiting and had trouble swallowing. Tests revealed a tortuous aneurysm in her aorta, the massive vessel that carries blood from the heart to the abdomen. The woman's doctors say the aneurysm was located in her right side and was not the result of a heart attack. They say the woman's symptoms were similar to those of people who have a history of aneurysms and that she had a high blood pressure and other health issues. The surgery to repair the aneurysm was performed on Friday. The woman's condition is being described in a report published in the British Medical Journal. (In another unusual case, a woman in Germany is recovering from a rare brain aneurysm.)

– A new surgery in India is giving doctors a much better chance of saving the organs that are damaged in car accidents, worker accidents, and other mishaps, the BBC reports. laparoscopy, or "low-tech" surgery, uses a small video instrument to slice through tissue and then deliver a drug that causes the body to re-establish blood flow to injured organs. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors in the state of Gujarat say that in the past, patients who suffered organ damage in accidents or other mishaps would have had to have a laparotomy, which is a procedure in which the body uses a blade to slice through tissue. But laparoscopy has made it easier for doctors to diagnose the condition and repair the damaged organs, the Hindu reports. In the study, 25 patients with bladder injuries were given the drug, called hemolock, and then the surgery was performed. "The main goal of the surgery is to repair the damaged organs, but if you have a perforated organ, you have to have a major surgery to save it," the lead researcher says. " laparoscopy has made it much easier to do that." The drug, he says, also prevents the body from re-establishing blood flow to the injured organ, which is a major concern

– A cancer drug that causes liver damage and other side effects is currently only available in animal form, but researchers in India say they've figured out a way to deliver it directly to the skin. The technique, which involves using an electric current to delivermethotrexate to the skin, is called transdermal drug delivery and has previously been used to deliver drugs like lotions and creams, the BBC reports. "It's a completely new way of doing drugs, and it's much more sensitive," says a researcher. "You don't need to go into the bloodstream to do it, and you don't need to worry about the side effects."methotrexate is used to treat cancer, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis, but it causes liver damage and other side effects, and the patches used to deliver it are expensive. The patches being developed by the Indian company daburtic are made of a mixture of chemicals and are about the size of a quarter, the Telegraph reports. daburtic patches are expected to be ready for clinical trials in two years, and the BBC notes that they could be a cheaper way to treat cancer patients.

– If you're one of the millions of people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, it may be time to get moving. A new study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that exercise can help ease the pain and disability of the disease, which is characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints, reports the New York Times. The study found that people with rheumatoid arthritis who got at least 75 minutes of moderate exercise per week had a 30% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease than those who got little or no exercise. The researchers say that exercise can help ease the pain of the disease, as well as improve bone density and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The study's lead author, Dr. Andrew Mente, tells the Times that exercise can help people with rheumatoid arthritis avoid the " vicious circle" of disability and heart disease. "The more you exercise, the less pain you feel," he says. "It's a huge step forward for the disease." The researchers say that exercise can help ease the pain of the disease by reducing inflammation and the production of certain cytokines, which are linked to inflammation. Those cytokines can also be linked to a condition called rheumatoid cachexia, in which muscle mass is lost and the condition is a major disability. (Rheumatoid arthritis is

– If you're already tempted to indulge in a soda when you're feeling particularly hungry, you may want to think twice about adding more sugar to your diet. A new study suggests that even a single daily sugar addition—such as a soda containing high- fructose corn syrup—can actually cause weight gain, the New York Times reports. Researchers at the University of Southern California report in the journal PLOS ONE that rats fed a diet high in fructose showed signs of weight gain even after consuming a sugar-free beverage. The researchers say the findings suggest that fructose may be "inactivating" a key part of the brain's reward system, which may cause people to eat more when they're feeling hungry. The researchers say that while more research is needed, their findings are in line with previous research that shows fructose can cause health problems in animals. (A recent study found that people who drink a fructose-sweetened beverage have a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.)

– If you're a bit of a jerk, you may want to think twice about getting your teeth stretched. A new study out of Japan suggests that even a simple stretch of the teeth can have profound effects on the body, the BBC reports. Researchers injected rabbits with a tranquilizer and then stretched them with a special device that causes their teeth to move in a circle. The device also produced a "photorealistic" effect that made the rabbits' teeth move faster, according to a press release. The rabbits also showed signs of the effects of a stretch for up to a month. "The animals were very relaxed after the stretch, and they were able to walk on the ground without problems," says lead researcher Hideo Sawada. "They were able to walk on their own for the first time." The device also produced a protein called myosin heavy chain that is normally found in the muscle fibers of the leg, but which is found in the muscle fibers of the teeth, according to the study. The change in myosin heavy chain—which is found in the muscles of the hand, wrist, and hand bones—appears to be linked to the slow growth of the muscles, which is important for walking. The device could be used to treat people with arthritis in

– Meningiomas are often the most common form of brain tumor, and they're often removed without symptoms—but in a study published in the journal JAMA Neurology, researchers say they've found a particularly surprising trend in the removal of the tumors without symptoms. In 100 patients who had theirngiomas removed, only one—in the case of one woman—showed symptoms at one year, and in five of the cases, those symptoms had vanished by the time the tumor was removed. "This is the first time we've seen such a low degree of invasion," lead author Dr. Jo ⁇ o Gregorio da Silva tells the New York Times. "It's like having a knife in your hand." The study found that in 23 of the cases, the tumor had returned, and in five of the cases, the brain had been invaded. The tumors were found to be much larger than previously believed, with an average of 8 inches long and a maximum of 6 inches in diameter, LiveScience reports. The researchers say that the tumors appear to be more common in older people, and they believe that's because they have a higher risk of inheriting a genetic mutation that makes them more susceptible to the disease. The researchers say that in the future, doctors should

– A teen in China is dead from hiv, the virus that causes AIDS, after an apparent skin infection that was hard to treat and spread through the skin. The 16-year-old's case, described in the New England Journal of Medicine, is one of the first known to involve multiple skin lesions, reports the BBC. The boy had no family history of skin disease and no history of sexual intercourse, but had developed a rash covering his face and arms that appeared non-itchy and spread to his neck and upper limbs. When a doctor diagnosed him with hiv in 2005, the rash had diminished and his cells had increased from 186 cells per liter to 479 cells per liter. But when a new doctor diagnosed him with a skin infection in 2007, the rash remained and spread more rapidly. The boy had refused treatment for hiv, and a skin biopsy revealed multiple lesions. The best treatment for hiv is to stop the spread of the virus through the skin, but it can be difficult to do so in cases where the immune system is weakened. In this case, the boy's immune system was weakened by years of exposure to the virus and the lesions spread rapidly. The best treatment is to stop the spread of the virus through treatment, but the boy died

– Blood tests can be tough to interpret—and a new study suggests they could be even tougher to interpret if you store them in the freezer. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center report in the journal Scientific Reports that they stored 17 blood tests—including cholesterol, calcium, phosphorus, urea, and bilirubin—in an upright position for 30 minutes at a temperature of 20 degrees Fahrenheit, then kept them there for seven, 15, or 30 days. They found that the tests—which can reveal things like a person's cholesterol level or blood pressure—deteriorated within hours at the temp, reports Live Science. "This is the first time that we've been able to show that prolonged storage at a temperature this low has the potential to significantly affect analytes' stability," says lead researcher Dr. Gregory Okin. The team says the findings could help doctors make better decisions about how to test patients, reports the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

– Milk is good for you, but don't get too excited about it if you're a girl. A new study out of Sweden suggests that girls who drink a lot of milk are more likely to be obese than their male counterparts, reports the New York Times. Researchers looked at data from nearly 500 young people, aged 9 to 16, and found that those who drank a lot of milk were more likely to be obese than those who drank a lot of cow's milk. The study did not prove causation, but researchers say the results suggest that the milk is responsible for the differences in height and weight. "Our results suggest that milk intake plays a large role in determining height and weight," says lead researcher Karin Nilsdotter of the University of Rebro. "It is not clear whether the milk intake is the reason for the differences in height and weight, but we do know that the milk consumption in young people is high, so it is possible that the milk is responsible." The researchers did not compare their results to a study out of the US that found boys who drank a lot of milk were more likely to be obese, reports the BBC. (A new study suggests that milk is good for you if you're looking to fend off heart disease.)

– The human genome is full of more than 3,000 genes, but scientists say they've found a "conserved domain" in each of them that may help explain why. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, say the domain—a set of proteins that play a role in cell activity—is present in all five human genomes, reports the BBC. They found that in each of the five genomes, there are at least 211 such domains, and they're present in about half the genes. "It's a pretty remarkable finding," says study co-author George Church, per the Guardian. "It's like having a very, very small, very specific piece of information in your DNA." The study, published in the journal Nature, looked at proteins in the genomes of homo sapiens, drosophila melanogaster, arabidopsis thaliana, caenoitis elegans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. Church's team found that the domains are present in about 519 genes, and they're present in about half the genes. The finding could help scientists better understand how genomes organize protein domains, which are often a result of "functional constraints on interacting domains," he says.

– A new study out of Russia has found that the drug-resistant form of tuberculosis is spreading rapidly there, the New York Times reports. Researchers looked at 235 people with tuberculosis from 2008 to 2010 in two cities, Irkutsk and yakutia, and found that 90% had drug-resistant forms of the disease. Of those, 60% had multidrug-resistant forms, meaning they could fight off all known drugs. "This is the first time that we have found drug-resistant tuberculosis in Russia," the lead author of the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, tells the Times. "It is a worrying development." The study found that 90% of the multidrug-resistant forms were found in yakutia, while the other 10% were found in Irkutsk. Of the 235, 25 died, including all but four of the multidrug-resistant cases. The Times notes that while Russia has had a relatively good track record in fighting TB, the country is now on pace to have more TB cases than the US this year. (In other fascinating TB news, a woman in Siberia has become the first person in the world to be cured of the disease.)

– Men who have radical prostatectomy—the removal of the prostate—are often disappointed to find that they're still experiencing erectile dysfunction more than a year later, LiveScience reports. Now, South Korean researchers say that men who take the drug pde5-is for a day or two after surgery are more likely to see a significant improvement in their sex lives. The researchers, whose study is published in the Journal of Urology, say that in a study of 92 men who had the surgery, those who took 5mg of pde5-is daily for a day or two after surgery were more than twice as likely to see a significant improvement in their sex lives than those who took 10mg daily. The drug, which blocks the action of a class of enzymes that cause penile tissue to become inflamed and damaged, has been used to treat men with prostate cancer since 1998. But the researchers say that more research is needed to determine whether the drug is safe and effective for men who have radical prostatectomy.

– The development of quantum dots—tiny, non-contact, non-destructive, and potentially useful materials—has excited the scientific world. Now, researchers have developed a new laser technology that could someday be used to create artificial intelligence and other advanced devices, the BBC reports. The development of the so-called quantum mechanical Random Access Laser (Q-M-R-LAK) is a "milestone in the development of inexpensive, high-bandwidth, and non-contact quantum sensors and quantum computers," according to a study published in Nature. Q-M-R-LAK works by emitting a quantum dot (or "Q-D") of any color onto a white background. The quantum dot is made of a single atom of oxygen. The researchers used a technique called "ion implantation induced intermixing" to create multiple Q-M-R-LAKs on a single chip, Phys.org reports. The trick is to get multiple atoms of a specific color to work together in a way that changes the energy level of the quantum dot. This allows the laser to be used for a wide range of applications, from creating artificial intelligence to creating new drugs. "It's a really cool idea, but it's a very, very small sample,"

– A new drug being developed for the treatment of infections in humans and animals could offer a much-needed weapon against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A team of researchers led by a University of California-San Diego infectious disease expert has created a synthetic version of lincomycin, a common antibiotic found in animals and humans, reports the Guardian. The drug would be similar in structure to clindamycin, another common antibiotic, and it would be able to bind to bacteria more effectively, reports the New York Times. "It's a new class of antibiotics that are very effective against a lot of different bacteria," says lead researcher Francoise Bozon. "It's a very exciting idea." The team is working on a smaller version of the drug that would be given to patients with infections of the skin, skin abscesses, and urinary tract infections, reports the BBC. The hope is that it would be able to treat a lot of infections without causing side effects like nausea and rash. (A new drug could help treat a particularly nasty skin infection.)

– An 80-year-old Japanese man died of penile cancer just a year after receiving a controversial new treatment, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The man had a large tumor—nearly 7 inches in diameter—in his inguinal region that had spread to his femoral vessels. Doctors removed the tumor and its blood and exudates, then surgically implanted a zinc paste into the wound to prevent it from growing back. The paste is made from zinc, and it's been shown to fight off wounds from other cancers, including skin, head, and neck cancers. But penile cancer is a rare form, with only about 5,600 new cases reported in the US every year, and only about 2,000 people are alive today with the disease. The Japanese man was diagnosed with penile squamous cell carcinoma, a type of penile cancer, after he developed pain and a smelly odor in his left inguinal region. A CT scan revealed the tumor, and the doctors then began chemotherapy, radiation, and the paste treatment. The tumor shrank by 70% after the first course of chemotherapy, and the paste was removed the following day. The patient died a year later, with the cancer continuing to spread. Doctors say the case is the first time

– A South Korean woman who died in May had worms in her guts, and doctors say they may have been responsible for her death. The woman, who was 82, died of chronic hookworm infection, which caused her to lose up to 30% of her body's iron, reports LiveScience. The worms, which were about the size of sesame seeds, were found in her duodenum, the part of the body where blood and iron are drawn, and doctors say they were likely contracted by an uninfected spouse or partner. The worms were removed by a special procedure called endoscopy, which revealed the worms' eggs, reports the Korea Times. The worms' eggs were "negative for clonorchiasis, liver, and cystic anemia," and the woman's iron levels were normal, doctors say. The worms were also found to be carrying a rare genetic mutation that made the woman's immune system to reject the eggs, reports the BBC. Doctors say the woman, who had no history of traveling, should have been treated for the infection years ago, but she didn't have the money or inclination. "It is not easy to find cases of hookworm infection in humans, but we have found one in a very rare case in a very old person," a

– A new respiratory virus has been identified in children in Spain, and researchers say it's a particularly dangerous one that causes diarrhea. Hbov is a common cause of respiratory tract infections in children, but it has also been linked to gastroenteritis in adults, reports the New York Times. Researchers say they detected the virus in the feces of two children who had diarrhea after swallowing respiratory secretions, reports the Guardian. The virus is especially dangerous to young children, though it's not clear whether the children had it in their intestines or were infected by other animals. "This is the first time we have seen a gastrointestinal pathogen in humans, so it is very concerning," a researcher tells the Times. "It is a very new pathogen and it is very dangerous." The virus is especially dangerous to young children because they have a weak immune system, and they are more likely to have underlying health problems, such as asthma or eczema. The virus is especially dangerous to those with weakened immune systems, so it is important to give young children proper vaccinations, the researchers say. (In the US, the Hbov strain is responsible for a particularly nasty respiratory illness.)

– A 7-year-old boy in Spain is the youngest known case of multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, a rare genetic disorder characterized by a buildup of kidney stones in the fetus that can lead to permanent kidney failure. The boy, who was born at 30 weeks gestation, was found to have a small right kidney that was still detectable by age 7; his left kidney was not. The condition is typically associated with a single genetic mutation, known as cd, in the pten gene. The boy's doctors say the condition is not only rare, but also a very unusual one: "This is the first time we have seen a case of multicystic dysplastic kidney disease in a child," a researcher tells the New York Times. "It's a very rare condition that is not associated with any other genetic disorder." The condition is so rare that the researchers say it is "extremely rare" and "extremely concerning." The researchers say the boy's condition is likely related to a rare genetic disorder known as coloboma syndrome, in which a mutated version of the pten gene causes a buildup of tumors in the body. The tumors can cause kidney failure and, in rare cases, brain and eye problems. The condition is also associated with a rare type

– People who have high blood pressure or diabetes are at risk of developing peripheral artery disease, or PAD, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. But a new study suggests that a blood test can help spot those at risk before it's too late, the BBC reports. Researchers at Harvard and the Harvard School of Public Health looked at more than 100,000 people over 30 to find that those who had high levels of two blood markers, 2microglobulin and cystatin c, as well as high levels of creatinine—a marker of kidney function—were more likely to have PAD, according to a press release. creatinine is a common indicator of kidney failure, but it's often too low. The two blood markers are "relatively low molecular weight" that pass through the glomerular filtration barrier without being affected by muscle mass or secretion, the researchers explain. They also appear to be more reliable than creatinine in predicting pad risk. The study did not find a link between pad and high blood pressure or diabetes, which are already known risk factors for PAD. But the study did find a link between high levels of 2microglobulin and cystatin c and high creatinine. Researchers say the findings suggest that people with high blood pressure or diabetes who have high blood creatinine should be checked for pad before

– A new cancer drug is showing promise in treating breast cancer, but it's not as effective as previously believed, according to researchers. The drug, everolimus, blocks the growth of new blood vessels in breast cancer patients, the Telegraph reports. "It's like taking a knife and cutting through the breast," says lead researcher Dr. Supat Thammasitboon. "You get a very small knife and you cut the breast." The drug, which is being tested in several clinical trials, is an angiogenesis inhibitor, meaning it blocks the growth of new blood vessels. But it hasn't been effective enough to be considered a cancer treatment, according to a review of more than 300 previous trials. "There is no reason for premature pessimism," says Thammasitboon. "There is a huge unmet need in cancer treatment."

– The world's last remaining blue rhino is recovering from a tracheostomy procedure that saved his life, but it's not clear whether the procedure will be widely used in the future. The male rhino, who was born in southern Italy in 2009, is in good condition in a breeding program at the San Diego Zoo, but he will need to undergo further treatment in order to be able to breathe on his own. The tracheostomy— inserting a tube into the inside of the animal's throat—is a risky procedure that can cause serious complications, but researchers say it is the only way to save the animal's life, the BBC reports. The tracheostomy—which involves cutting a tube into the throat and using a tube-opening device called a bronchoscope to make the incision—is the only option for patients with a life-threatening condition who can't breathe using a tube-opening tracheostomy, the BBC notes. The procedure is performed in about 10 cases a year in the US, but it is not common and the death rate is low. Researchers say that in the case of the blue rhino, the death rate was less than one in 100 years, but they say that the procedure is safer than other options and they have reviewed previous

– A new drug that's been shown to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration appears to be effective for at least a year in treating the disease that causes gradual blindness in the middle of middle age, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.ranibizumab, a monoclonal antibody, was given to 25 patients at the Polish military's ophthalmology clinic in Warsaw. They were divided into three groups, each given 0.5mg of the drug monthly for six months, reports the Telegraph. After one year, all groups showed significant improvement in their vision. "We were very surprised," says study co-author Pawel Dworczyk. "The difference in vision was so dramatic." The patients had experienced severe damage to their retinas, including retinal detachment and macular hemorrhage. The drug, which is approved for treating other eye diseases, blocks the growth of new blood vessels in the retina, which is a key factor in the progression of the disease, reports the Guardian. The best news is that the patients who received the drug showed no sign of the disease at one year, though some did suffer significant eye damage over the course of the study. The next step will be a larger study to determine if it is safe and effective for treating all age-related

– If you're worried about the appearance of your teeth after a crown or other dental work, you may want to skip the bleaching process. A new study suggests that the process can cause them to lose their natural color, LiveScience reports. Researchers exposed three types of dental materials to bleaching agents at different temperatures. Two of them were home bleaching products and the other was an office bleaching system. The bleaching agents caused the glass-ionomer restorations used in crowns and bridges to lose their natural color, according to a press release. The restoration was then restored with a different type of glass-ionomer. The bleaching agents caused the glass-ionomer to lose its natural color, too. The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, found that the bleaching agents caused the restoration to lose its natural color by up to 30%. But it's not just the appearance of the restorations that could be affected. The study also found that the bleaching agents caused the restoration to release more fluoride than usual. It's unclear why the glass-ionomer restorations lost their natural color, but researchers say the process is similar to the way people naturally lose color with products like toothpaste and cosmetics.

– A 22-year-old woman in Oregon is in critical condition after a simple airway procedure that she says left her feeling "like a ghost." The woman had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope inserted into her throat that allowed doctors to see the inside of the airways in her lungs, the New York Times reports. The procedure is used to diagnose conditions such as asthma, COPD, and sinusitis. "It’s a very simple procedure, and it’s a lot easier than you might think," Dr. Nancy Baxter, who performed the procedure, tells KGW. "It’s a lot less invasive, and it’s a lot less dangerous." The woman was awake and talking when she was brought to the ER, but she was in cardiac arrest within minutes and died later at the hospital. Doctors say the woman, who had a history of asthma, likely had a rare genetic condition that made it difficult for her to breathe properly. The procedure is usually done on people who have a history of pneumonia, but the woman had a history of lung cancer, and doctors were concerned enough to order an biopsy. The woman's case is being investigated. (A woman in Texas died after a simple airway procedure.)

– A new study out of India suggests that people who are obese but have a healthy waist-to-hip ratio are more likely to have a condition known as metabolic syndrome, reports the New York Times. The syndrome is a collection of conditions that include elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose levels, and can lead to heart disease and diabetes. The researchers looked at more than 5,600 people in a rural area of India and found that those with a healthy waist-to-hip ratio were 30% less likely to have the syndrome, reports LiveScience. The best guess is that the ratio is related to a person's risk of developing the condition, but more research is needed to confirm that.

– If you suffer from gum disease, you may want to skip the dentist's office altogether. A new study suggests that a certain genetic mutation may play a role in the progression of periodontitis, reports the New York Times. Researchers at the University of California-San Francisco studied the genomes of more than 1,000 people and found that people with a faulty gene called IL-10 were more likely to develop gum disease, reports the Los Angeles Times. The faulty gene is known to play a role in the production of inflammatory cytokines, which are produced by immune cells and can be helpful in the fight against bacteria. The faulty gene was also found to be associated with an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis, reports the New York Daily News. The researchers say that people with the faulty gene who suffer from gum disease have a higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. The good news is that researchers are now working on a treatment that could be delivered through the mouth.

– Asian men have a lower risk of prostate cancer than Westerners, and researchers are pointing to a possible reason: soy. Researchers in Japan found that men of Asian descent who ate a lot of soy products had a 30% lower risk of the cancer than those who ate a lot of red meat, reports the New York Times. The findings, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, don't prove that soy causes prostate cancer, but they do suggest that isoflavones in soy products could help fend off the disease. "There are a number of factors that could be at play, and soy is of course one of them," says lead author Dr. Hideo Kawato of Kyoto University. "But the most important one is that we know that isoflavones are protective." So what are they? "We don't know," Kawato tells the Times. "But the most likely explanation is that isoflavones are protective because they have a weak estrogenic effect." He says that isoflavones are known to be protective against a number of other cancers, including breast, colon, and ovarian. (Meanwhile, a study finds that men who smoke have a higher risk of getting the deadliest form of prostate cancer.)

– A new study out of Spain suggests that a type of childhood brain tumor is tied to a "switch on and off" in the body, and that it could lead to a cure. The study in Nature Communications looked at the medulloblastoma tumor, the most common childhood brain tumor in the world, and found that a type of protein called mirna was tied to the growth of the tumor. mirnas are "microRNAs," or small DNA fragments, and they bind to and regulate a protein called p53, which is found in medulloblastoma. When p53 is activated, mirnas bind to a third protein that is also found in cancer, and when that protein is not activated, the tumor grows. The study suggests that mirnas are "switched on and off" when p53 is activated, and that this could lead to a cure. "This is the first time that a gene pathway has been identified that is associated with a major correlate of this cancer," lead author Miguel Angel Moraes says in a release. mirnas are also known to play a role in other diseases, including cancer, and their role in medulloblastoma is not yet clear. Moraes' team plans to conduct a clinical trial in the next few years to test a mir

– Women who want to look and feel younger may want to try a little laser therapy first. South Korean researchers report in the journal Nature Communications that low-level laser therapy—a type of fractional laser meant to produce a specific response in the body—restores skin's moisture balance and reduces the appearance of wrinkles and other signs of aging by up to 50% after just two 15-minute sessions per week for six weeks. The researchers, who studied 30 female patients between the ages of 30 and 55, found no significant differences in the amount of new collagen and other proteins produced by the laser or between the two groups after just two sessions, reports New Scientist. The study's lead author, however, says the results are "exciting" and suggest that laser therapy could be an effective way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and other signs of aging. The laser, which is made of copper and is said to work in the same way as a laser for skin treatments, was used on the women by a doctor who used a copper wire on their face and neck for five minutes every day for a year. The researchers say the method is similar to Chinese acupuncture, which has been shown to increase blood flow in the skin and reduce inflammation.

– A simple blood test can predict the success of a doctor's treatment for patients with coronary artery disease, according to a new study. Researchers at the University of Bath in England say the quick and easy test uses a biomarker of heart disease called troponin, which is found in the blood of people with a history of heart attacks and strokes, reports the BBC. The telltale sign is elevated levels of the protein, which can indicate a heart attack or a narrowed artery. The test, which can detect it up to three days before symptoms appear, can predict the success of a doctor's treatment within a day or two, researchers say. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at 976 patients with coronary artery disease and found that the test was accurate in 90% of cases, the Guardian reports. "This is a huge step forward," the lead researcher says. "It's a very simple test that can be used quickly and accurately to determine the best course of treatment for patients with coronary syndrome." The test is expected to be used in hospitals within a year. (A recent study found that people who die from heart attacks are more likely to be obese.)

– A 50-year-old man died of a rare form of pancreatitis that was found when his pancreas began to enlarge—and it was not from a hole in the pancreas. The cause of the so-called pancreatic panniculitis is still unknown, but the man's symptoms included abdominal pain, weakness, decreased appetite, and a swollen pancreas that was not expected to worsen, reports Live Science. A skin biopsy found fat necrosis and ghost-like cells around the pancreas, and the man was given a steroid that stopped the growth of the fat cells. But the man died after 10 days of intensive care, and doctors say the cause of death was not immediately clear. Pancreatic panniculitis is a very rare form of pancreatitis that occurs when pancreatic enzymes escape from the pancreas and into the bloodstream, reports the New York Times. The condition is usually treated with surgery or a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, but it can also be successfully treated with a steroid. The man in this case had a number of other pancreatic disorders, including post- traumatic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, pancreas divisum, and hemophagocytic syndrome, but this was the first time it had been reported to be associated with pancreatic panniculitis on the skin, reports the BMJ.

– A Florida woman who underwent a routine blood test was shocked to learn that her red blood cell count was significantly higher than the normal level. The reason? The Florida Department of Health says it was a "human error," per the Miami Herald. The test is used to determine the level of a woman's red blood cell count, and it's not clear why the error occurred. The Florida Department of Health says it's investigating the incident, which occurred in late 2014, and it's looking into whether other routine blood tests were affected. The Herald reports the woman was given a blood test to determine her red blood cell count after she was admitted to a Miami-area hospital with a blood infection and sepsis. The test revealed the woman's blood cell count was .055%, or four times the normal level. The Herald reports the woman was given a second test to determine her red blood cell count and it was .07%, or four times the normal level. She was released from the hospital two days later and underwent a follow-up test to confirm the results. The Florida Department of Health says it's looking into whether other routine tests were affected. (A woman who had a miscarriage ended up in the hospital with a potentially deadly blood clot

– If you're a back athlete, you may want to think twice before popping a pill every time you hurt your back. A study published in the journal PLOS ONE finds that back pain is more common among athletes than previously thought, with one in five back injuries occurring during a single season. Researchers at the University of Southern Bulgaria in Sofia looked at the back pain of 4,507 students ages 12 to 17. They found that back pain was most prevalent in those who were overweight or obese, and that the most common injury was a herniated disk, reports the New York Times. "The results of our study show that the risk of back pain in young people is higher than previously thought," the lead researcher says in a press release. "This is important because, until now, the medical literature has not shown that back pain is a problem among young people." The researchers say that the findings should be interpreted with caution. The study didn't look at why back pain is more common, but researchers say it could be that athletes are more likely to take painkillers during practice. "The main reason for the increase in back pain is the increase in the number of activities," the lead researcher says. "The amount of time spent in these activities has been shown to be a risk factor for back

– A simple procedure could dramatically improve the survival rate of people who suffer cardiac arrest and are resuscitated after death, according to a new study. A team of researchers says that cooling patients following resuscitation with therapeutic hypothermia—a process that involves lowering the heart rate and body temperature—has been shown to improve both survival and brain function, the BBC reports. The team, which describes its findings in the journal Circulation, says that the procedure, which requires patients to be kept at room temperature for up to four hours, is currently used on about 10% of patients who suffer cardiac arrest and are resuscitated after death. The researchers say that the combination of therapeutic hypothermia and the sedative sevoflurane did not produce additional inflammatory effects in pigs, but they say that anesthetics may not provide "significant neuroprotection beyond that which is already being produced by therapeutic hypothermia." The researchers say that the procedure could be used to prevent people who suffer a repeat cardiac arrest from suffering brain damage, reports the New York Times. (A recent study found that people who suffer a heart attack are more likely to die if they are not resuscitated.)

The study published in the journal Scientific Reports says that the proposed plant would be so unstable that it could collapse under its own weight and release dangerous amounts of radiation. The problem is that the US military has a huge stockpile of spent nuclear fuel that needs to be disposed of quickly, and the problem is that the military has a lot of time on its hands.

Researchers found that women who had a history of asthma or other breathing problems were more likely to have a child with a heart attack or stroke, the New York Times reports. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, also found that women who had a history of high blood pressure were more likely to have a child with a stroke. Researchers say the findings add to the growing body of evidence that women who carry a child premature are at greater risk of having an asthma attack or other serious health issues later in life. The study looked at the immune responses of 16 pregnant women. They found that the women's immune responses changed throughout the pregnancy, with changes occurring at different stages, according to a press release. The study's lead author, Dr. Nancy Avis, says the findings add to the growing body of evidence that women who carry a child premature are at greater risk of having an asthma attack or other serious health issues later in life. She says that more research is needed to determine whether other risk factors, such as drinking or smoking, are at play. (Another recent study found that half of US women have abortions

– If you're looking to lose weight and keep it off, you may want to start with a healthy diet. A new study suggests that a daily dose of vitamin E can help offset the negative effects of exercise on the body, reports the New York Times. Researchers in Australia studied the effects of vitamin E on 27 healthy people who were given either a daily dose of the vitamin or a placebo for two weeks. The subjects were split into two groups: one that was given vitamin E and the other that was given a placebo. After four weeks, the subjects' levels of vitamin E were higher than in the placebo group. The New York Post reports that the vitamin appears to help offset the negative effects of exercise on the body, including increased levels of fat and cholesterol. The Post also notes that the study's participants were all between the ages of 18 and 29. The findings are based on a small study, and it's not clear whether the vitamin played a role in the results. But the lead researcher tells the Times that the results suggest that people who take vitamin E "can do some good things for their health."

– It's a rare condition that causes a person's brain to grow so fast that it can out-compete the body's own growth hormone. And it's been documented before, but researchers say this case is one of the most unusual they've seen. The condition is called acromegaly, and it affects one in 200,000 people, reports Live Science. The condition causes a fast-growing growth hormone called glial cells in the brain to proliferate. They can then fire up the body's growth hormone, causing tumors to form in the brain. The condition is so rare that it's often referred to as "super-rare," reports the New York Times. In this case, researchers say they found the tumor in a 45-year-old Japanese woman's eye and they removed the glial cells three months after her diagnosis. The tumor had grown so fast that it shaved off one of her eyelashes. "This is the first time we have seen a super-rare condition occur in one of the eyes," says Dr. Hideo Sawada of Kyoto University's Department of Endocrinology. "It is very rare and it is very serious." Sawada says the woman's condition is so rare that doctors are not sure how often it

– It's not a myth that asthma triggers migraines, but a new study suggests that the headaches may actually be a little more common in those with the condition. Researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong report in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine that they studied the health records of more than 41,000 patients in the Chinese province of Taiwan, and that asthma patients were more likely to be diagnosed with a subtype of migraine known as acephalic migraine. The more severe the migraine, the more likely the patient was to be prescribed a steroid to help control the condition, reports the New York Times. The researchers say the mechanism behind the link isn't clear, but they did find that migraine was more common in patients with asthma who also had a history of heart disease or stroke. "The findings suggest that asthma management should include prevention of migraine and other respiratory disorders, and that migraine should be treated as a primary care condition," the lead researcher says in a press release. The researchers say that while the study doesn't prove causation, it does show that asthma can be a risk factor for migraine, reports the BBC.

– If you've ever dreamed of having your teeth fixed with a crown, you're in luck: A new study suggests that a simple two-step process can be used to create a more durable, more attractive crown. The Wall Street Journal reports that researchers at the University of California-San Diego used a computer-generated image of a human tooth to create a 3D model of a missing tooth. The idea was to create a more realistic impression of the missing tooth so dentists could use the new technology to bond brackets to it. The technology is based on the principle that the tooth's enamel will eventually deteriorate after the brackets are bonded, and the new technology eliminates the need for the dentist to de-bonding the brackets to prevent that deterioration. The new technology also allows the dentist to create a more natural-looking crown without the need to remove the brackets, which is a big plus for busy parents, according to a press release. The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The new technology was tested on the teeth of two adults. Both groups had brackets bonded to their teeth with two different adhesive systems. The brackets were then removed with pliers at a speed of about five seconds per tooth.

– A woman in her 50s who has a rare genetic disease is finally getting a bone drug that could slow the progression of her condition, the BBC reports. According to a study published in Nature Communications, researchers have found that a specific protein in the body is responsible for the destruction of bone. The woman has osteopetrosis, a rare condition that causes bone to slowly age and is characterized by an increase in bone mass. Researchers believe the woman has a faulty gene that causes a protein called nexin to become activated. nexin is then able to break down bone and destroy its outer layer. Researchers believe nexin is the reason the woman has an increased risk of osteoporosis. Researchers say they've found a way to block nexin's effect on the bone cell, the Guardian reports. They've also found that a specific gene is responsible for a process that causes a bone-marrow protein to become activated. Researchers say they hope to start clinical trials on a treatment for the woman within a year. (A woman in her 60s who has the same condition was given a bone drug that halted her disease.)

– Japanese people have a genetic mutation that makes them prone to heart disease, possibly due to a faulty gene that makes the body produce too many cholesterol-lowering drugs, according to a new study. The New York Times reports researchers used DNA technology to clone more than 2,800 Japanese people—about 5% of the population—and found that people from the country have a genetic mutation that makes them more prone to high cholesterol levels. The condition, known as a "protein-related genetic defect," is linked to about 10% of all heart attacks and strokes. The study, published in the journal Nature, says the genetic mutation is similar to one that makes people prone to schizophrenia. The condition is known to be linked to a genetic mutation in both Japanese and non-Japanese people. The New York Times reports researchers believe the condition is caused by a faulty gene that makes the body produce too many cholesterol-lowering drugs. The study's lead author, Nobuomatsu, says the condition is likely linked to a genetic mutation in the body that makes the body produce too many growth factors for white people. The condition is also tied to a genetic mutation that makes Japanese people prone to autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The Times reports researchers are now trying to figure out a way to prevent the condition from

– A new drug being tested on humans could help stop the brain's inflammatory response after a traumatic brain injury, the New York Times reports. According to a study published in Nature Communications, a protein called nuclear factor kappa b (nrf2 or nrf2) is responsible for regulating the body's antioxidant response after injury. When nrf2 is activated, cells produce more of two types of inflammatory cytokines, which can damage cells in the brain. When nrf2 is not activated, cells produce more of the other two types of cytokines, which can increase inflammation. A new drug being tested on humans could help suppress the nrf2 protein and prevent brain damage. "Our findings are a big deal because it's the first time that a gene or a cellular pathway is being shown to play a role in the development of brain injury," the study's lead author, Dr. Kenneth Thomas, tells the Times. The study looked at the effects of nrf2 on mice that had suffered traumatic brain injury. The mice that had nrf2 deficiency were more likely to have brain damage, according to a press release. The new drug, called erenumab, is being tested on humans. It's been shown to be safe and effective in treating a variety

– A doctor in Florida is warning doctors against using so-called "big data" to make life-saving decisions without a lot of research into how it might affect patients. In a study published in the journal JAMA, Dr. Gary Smith says he's worried about the impact of using such data on patients, who could end up paying more for care because doctors might not know what to do with it, the New York Times reports. "I think it's a very disturbing trend," he says. "It's a very disturbing trend that's going to have a very negative effect on public health." So far, he's only used one of three big data prediction systems he's studied, but he plans to use another in the future. The first system, called iCritic, scores patients on a scale of 1 to 10 based on various factors, including how well they responded to certain treatments. The second system, called Apache Carrot, scores patients based on how well they responded to common treatments. But while both systems are fairly easy to use, they can be biased and inaccurate, Smith says. "I think the most important thing to know is that we need to be careful about using these kinds of systems in intensive care," he says. "

– A new study finds that hospitals in the central Illinois area are sharing information about bacteria that is resistant to common antimicrobial drugs, the Chicago Tribune reports. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign surveyed 77 area hospitals to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They found that 40% of isolates tested in the area were resistant to a common antibiotic, methicillin. But in the southwest area, only 91% of isolates were resistant to vancomycin. The study was published in the journal JAMA. "We found a shocking level of drug resistance in the region," says lead author Dr. Carrie Ann Lucas. "It's concerning." The study found that hospitals in the area are sharing information about bacteria that is resistant to common antimicrobial drugs, but they are not sharing their susceptibility data to common drugs. This could be a problem for hospitals in other areas of the country, where the same bacteria are resistant to common drugs, the Tribune notes. The study also found that hospitals in the southwest area are sharing information about bacteria that is resistant to common antibiotics, but they are not sharing their susceptibility data to common antibiotics. "It's a big problem," says Lucas. "We need to be prepared." (A study found that the average American has nearly twice the risk of

– Pandemics are always a dangerous business, but the H1N1 virus proved especially deadly for young children, the elderly, and people with chronic health conditions. Between April 2009 and April 2010, there were 443 pediatric influenza-related deaths in the US, according to a new report. Of those, 117 were in children under 5 years old, according to the CDC. Of those, 52 were in the under 5 group, and 16 were in the over 5 group. The report also found that the number of hospitalizations for influenza in this age group increased by 76% from 2009 to 2010. The report also found that the number of hospitalizations for influenza in this age group decreased by about half from 2008 to 2010. But that's still a lot of hospitalizations, and it's not clear whether the drop was due to the new vaccine or a general decline in infections. “It’s still very early in the season and we’re still seeing hospitalizations and deaths,” a pediatrician not involved with the report tells the New York Times. “It’s still a very large number, but it’s not a huge number.”

– A woman in India who fell and hit her head on the pavement in 2010 ended up with a dislocated shoulder—but the 45-year-old didn't suffer any sort of catastrophic injury to her shoulder, the New York Times reports. Instead, she suffered a rare "bilateral traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation," according to a study published in the Journal of Neurosurgery. The woman had no history of epilepsy or instability in other joints, and the study's lead author says the condition is "very rare." The woman's left shoulder was initially dislocated after the fall, but she recovered in time to stand and walk, the Times notes. The author of the study says the woman's left shoulder is now "completely dislocated" and she can walk again. The woman's pain was so bad that she had to have surgery, which involved cutting off the top of her shoulder and drilling the bottom of her shoulder to make it more stable. The Times notes that the woman was able to stand for a few hours after the surgery, and the lead author says she is "very lucky" that the operation went well.

– Guys who grow up with a heavy belly may be more likely to be obese as they get older, according to a new study. Researchers looked at more than 3,400 men who were born in Britain in 1946 and tracked their body mass index from age 14 to age 26. They found that men with a heavy belly were more likely to be obese by their 30s, reports the New York Times. "We were surprised by the size of the difference," says lead researcher Dr. Peter Schultz of the University of Warwick. "We were not expecting to find such a large difference." The researchers say the results suggest that "men with a heavy belly who are in the early adulthood should be advised to lose weight to avoid obesity later in life," reports the Telegraph. The study did not look at why the men grew up with a heavy belly, but researchers say the reason may be that the belly grew around the man's spine, which is a good sign for health. The study did not look at why the men grew up with a heavy belly, but the lead researcher says it's possible that the man's body mass index grew because of hormonal changes during childhood. (Heavy drinking is linked to a higher risk of obesity.)
