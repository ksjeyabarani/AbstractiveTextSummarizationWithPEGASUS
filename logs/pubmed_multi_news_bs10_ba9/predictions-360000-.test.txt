we present a case of an anonymous person who dropped a coin containing a large amount of cash into a kettle at a charity event . 
 the amount of cash was several hundred thousand dollars . 
 after the event , the anonymous person complained of feeling unwell and was referred to our hospital . 
 histological examination of the kettle revealed the presence of a large amount of pseudomonas aeruginosa .
