i went out to get coffee at 1am, because why not?
i trekked down to the shop to get cash out, and ended up talking to the cashier for about 40 minutes about his whole life story.
then i really wanted my coffee.
i start my drive home, but pull over 15 minutes later as i need to check my phone.
then suddenly from the corner of my eye i spot an acquaintance. this guy would play at my local each friday, and he also busked in the valley.

we tried to see them twice last year and it didn't work out each time .
we got the tickets in October and waited all the way to January to see them.
i thought this year was our year. with retail being busy this time of year, i just didn't even double check the dates of the show.
i would go home and go straight to sleep, then go to the work the next day. rinse and repeat.
i just hid in the fine china stock room after finding out and cried out of stress and frustration for a lot of things. but this pushed me over the edge.

i wanted to shoot some hoops. there was a basketball in the football goal (that's where we store them when we're lazy or something)
i went to get it from the goal.
i kneel down, grab the ball and get back up, only to bang my head really hard against the crossbar.
it hurt really bad, and i was left crying for around 30 minutes.

i woke up late for class because my alarm was set to 9 pm not am (i just got a new phone, sue me)
i tried to turn down the volume or mute it but the buttons aren't responsive yet.
 suddenly the voice clearly says, "*have some smelly snatch rubbed in your face.*"
i shut my computer immediately and it still wouldn't stop!

i've been vegetarian since i was seven & would never hurt any creature on purpose.
i picked up a small pebble (no bigger than a dime) & underhanded it near the crowd of ducks.
they must've thought it was food because they all quickly dove for it & came in closer.
we did this for a minute until one of the pebbles actually landed on a duck's butt & bounced off; prompting a tail shake & quick indifference on the duck's part.
i burst out laughing "dude!! you just fucking murdered that duck, you're a fucking dick!

i'm in cuba and my wife and i are just starting to learn how to use the internet .
My friend (the pranked) has always fantasized about motorcycles, but it is something most cubans can only wish to attain .
i offer money for a pic in his underwear posted on his wall, and promise a motorcycle if he posts one without anything on at all .
my wife no longer wants anything to do with this, and says it has gotten past the point of cruelty .

i was taking a biology test and was bored.
I drew lines on the periodic table that turned out to be spongebob songs.
The vice principal saw my drawings and said that only a psychopath could write such an evil thing.
He called the police and said that he would call a psychiatrist and take me out of school.
i am now going to see a psychiatrist, might get recorded, and might go to court.

I was in junior year of high school and my teacher was the guidance counselor.
My teacher was the one who smelled ranch and thought it was in the bathroom.
I've never gotten over it.

i spend most of my time at the trailer.
i have a load of friends up there and it is generally a big party.
One day my two buddies and i went to go hangout with a couple of girls. they agreed, but wanted to shower first.
we head down to the public bathroom and they each choose their shower stall and go about their business.
A couple of seconds later a young girl and her much younger sister show up to use the bathroom.
my two buddies and i were waiting far enough away from the bathroom for our friends to finish showering.
i have never in my life heard a little girl

We threw small machetes at each other and parried with our wooden shields .
He hid behind a large box.
The machete was upright and he didn't bleed *that* much.
