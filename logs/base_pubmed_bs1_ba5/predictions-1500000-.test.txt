the term , dysphagia aortica , has been used to describe difficulty in swallowing caused by external compression from an ectatic , tortuous , or aneurysmal aorta as a result of age - related degeneration.2 ) dysphagia aortica is classically seen in elderly women with short stature who have hypertension and kyphosis.3 ) we report herein a patient with dysphagia associated with an aortic aneurysm .

when a limb muscle is stretched , changes in the expression of myosin heavy chain ( myhc ) , the protein primarily responsible for the contractile speed and metabolism type of muscle fibers , are observable within days.1 when stretched , muscle fibers tend to change from a fast phenotype ( mainly comprising myhc iib ) to a slow phenotype ( consisting mainly of myhc i or rarely i).1 - 6 these changes , although controversial , occur along a continuum of changes in the expression of myhcs from isoform iib to iso form i.7 in addition , the expression of less common isoforms , such as embryonic or neonatal myhcs ( developmental myhcs ) , may also be increased.8 the same responses might occur in the masticatory muscles after an increase in occlusal vertical dimension and/or mandibular advancement.9,10 in animal models , functional appliances commonly used for orthodontic treatment induce a phenotypic change in masticatory muscle fibers , with a tendency toward transition to a slow phenotype.11,12 slow fibers are fatigue resistant and easily convertible to fast fibers ; in comparison , fast fibers are fatigable but difficult to convert to slow fibers .

bone is a dynamic tissue which undergoes continuous self - renewal , and bone homeostasis relies on functional equilibrium among three types of cells : osteoclasts essential for bone resorption , osteoblasts responsible for bone matrix formation , and osteocytes involved in the reception and degradation of mechanical stimuli and in the regulation of osteoclast / osteoblast differentiation and function .
 osteoclasts are multinucleated cells ( containing up to 50 nucleus ) , derived from the fusion of mononuclear cells belonging to the monocyte - macrophage lineage .

despite the utility of these existing systems , additional data to estimate disease severity and track illness at the state level were needed during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic , as timely and representative information describing 2009 influenza pandemic influenza a (confirmed h1n1 ) (confirmed ph1n1 ) activity.
the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists ( cste ) established the aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity ( ahdra ) as part of an overall national surveillance strategy implemented to collect timely and representative data describing ph1n1 infections in the united states .
 the ahdra was designed to ( i ) track severe disease severity and track illness at the state level , ( ii ) track disease trends over brief periods of time to facilitate rapid public health responses to changes in ph1n1 epidemiology , and ( iii ) accommodate variation in local resources by providing a simple , flexible method that allowed reliable reporting by all states and territories without overwhelming health departments during the pandemic response .
