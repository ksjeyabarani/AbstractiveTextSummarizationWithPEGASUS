– Identity Thief, starring Melissa McCarthy, Jason Bateman, and John Cho, tells the story of a con artist who snatches a victim's credit cards and uses them to rack up thousands of dollars in charges on her own. What critics are saying: "Think of this as a movie review or as just a friendly warning from a like-minded individual: Identity Thief is so bad it’s hard to believe it wasn’t directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers," writes Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. "The snafus in the worst road movie since The Guilt Trip plunge Mr. Bateman and his female hippo into a motel with only a double bed, a grotesque sex scene with a reprobate she picks up in a bar who demands a threesome, a violent bar fight that bloodies his nose, a kidnapping, a multi-car collision going the wrong way on the freeway ... but why go on? They seem to be making it up as they go along, in a movie that threatens never to end." "How did an actor so charming, talented, attractive, and versatile get stuck in so much dreck?" asks Ty Burr in the Boston Globe. "Poor Jason Bateman. How did an actor so charming, talented

– If critics are to be believed, Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant is the best Alien movie since 1979's Alien. Here's what they're saying: "This beautifully made sci-fi thriller will immeasurably boost fan interest in the run of prequels, which Scott has recently said will consist of at least two more films until the action catches up to the 1979 original," writes Kenneth Turan at the Los Angeles Times. "This Fox release is a lock for major early summer box-office worldwide." "There's life in the old bugger yet. And, as always, plenty of death," writes Manohla Dargis at the New York Times. "The elegantly spare opening, in which a 'synthetic,' engages his 'father' in a pointedly philosophical conversation, simply and effectively frames the thrust of the film's central interest in human life's origins and its prospects for survival," she writes. "No matter that these aliens have been around far longer than most of the viewers who will see this film opening weekend have been alive; this entry feels vital, freshly thought out and keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the

– France has temporarily closed its embassies and schools in 20 countries in the wake of today's publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed by the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, Reuters reports. "We have indeed decided as a precautionary measure to close our premises, embassies, consulates, cultural centers, and schools," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. The move comes amid calls from Muslim leaders for France to take action against the magazine, which was fire-bombed last year over another Mohammed cartoon. "We reject and condemn the French cartoons that dishonor the Prophet," said the head of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.

– Herman Cain's campaign has yet to comment on a new 13-track gospel album that appeared on the Internet yesterday, but the Daily Caller is pretty sure it's the candidate himself. The album, Sunday Morning, was published 15 years ago by GLC Music, Selah Sound Production & Melodic Praise Records, and it's not being distributed now by the Cain campaign, the website's Dave Weigel says. With Cain on guitar, Thaddeus McCotter on guitar and vocals, and Jon Huntsman on keytar, "we’ve got ourselves a band," Mediaite notes.

– The estranged wife of acclaimed concert pianist Vadym Kholodenko has been ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial for allegedly killing the couple's two young daughters by smothering them with pillows, NBC News reports. Sofya Tsygankova has been ordered committed by a Texas judge to a state mental health facility for 120 days of treatment with the hope that she will be able to face justice when she regains "a reasonable degree of rational understanding." Kholodenko, 30, is a Ukrainian musician whose critically acclaimed career took off after he won the gold medal at the 14th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 2013. Police said that when the pianist arrived at his wife's home March 17 to pick up the girls and take them to preschool, he found Tsygankova covered in blood with cuts on her wrists and the two children dead in their beds. Tsygankova had visited a state mental health facility in Fort Worth a day before her daughters were found dead, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Inside the home, police found an empty prescription bottle of quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug used to treat such mental illnesses as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, the paper reported.

– "Here's the thing about being an erstwhile 'celebrity' who is now an outcast: You're not just feeling sorry for yourself. You're also feeling sorry for everyone around you—sometimes even the strangers. You can see the anxiety in their faces as they stammer out banalities, studiously avoiding the subject of career (or lack thereof), making vague gestures of encouragement that trail off into silence." So writes Ian Buruma in the New York Review of Books after he was forced out over an essay he wrote about former Canadian broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi, who has been accused of sexual assault and choking by at least 20 women, the Guardian reports. Ghomeshi was acquitted in 2016 of three counts of sexual assault and one count of choking involving three women, but he settled a fourth count of sexual assault last year and apologized to the women. Buruma's essay, in which he spoke of being "publicly pilloried" and "convicted on Twitter," set off a furious debate on social media about Ghomeshi's behavior and editorial judgment, with many women accusing Buruma of ignoring the "serious nature and number of allegations" against the former radio host. Buruma, who was only the third editor in the magazine's

– A group of divers in Mexico has discovered what National Geographic calls the "most important submerged archaeological site in the world," a 215-mile-long flooded cave on the Yucatan Peninsula. The Gran Acuifero Maya (GAM) project says the cave system known as Sac Actun is now connected to the larger Dos Ojos system, which stretches 83 miles and is believed to be the biggest flooded cave on the planet. "This immense cave represents the most important submerged archaeological site in the world, since it has more than a hundred archaeological contexts, among which is evidence of the first settlers of America, as well as the extinct fauna and, of course, of the Maya culture," GAM director and underwater archaeologist Guillermo de Anda tells Reuters. "It allows us to appreciate much more clearly how the rituals, the pilgrimage sites, and ultimately the great pre-Hispanic settlements that we know emerged," he says. GAM director Robert Schmittner, who led the project, says he has been searching for a connection between the two cave systems for 14 years. "Now, everyone's job is to keep it [up]," he says. According to data from the Quintana Roo Speleological Survey, there are 358 submerged cave systems in the north of the state,

– A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Dallas returned to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Sunday because someone forgot to unload a human heart on board, the Seattle Times reports. According to KOMO, the heart had arrived in Seattle from Sacramento on Saturday. It was supposed to be unloaded before the flight left Sunday, but it wasn't until the pilot took off for Dallas that the airline realized the "life-critical cargo shipment" was still on the plane. "We made the decision to return to Seattle to ensure the shipment was delivered to its destination within the window of time allotted by our cargo customer," CNN quotes Southwest as saying in a statement. The heart was unloaded from the plane after three hours in the air, and the flight took off again for Dallas after a five-hour delay. It's unclear what the heart was intended for, and no Seattle-area hospitals were involved in the shipment. Passenger Andrew Gottschalk says the incident was a "horrific story of gross negligence," but everyone on board "was happy to save a life."

– A 3-year-old boy is in stable condition after falling into a jaguar exhibit at the Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas yesterday, THV11 reports. According to a police report, the boy's father and grandfather saw him fall into the exhibit and both ran to get help. The father threw items at the animals to keep them at bay, but one ran off, and the other circled back and bit the boy on the back of the neck. The father then threw something else at the cats to get them to release, but they circled back again and bit the boy. A keeper heard screams for help and ran to the exhibit to see one of the jaguars with its mouth around the boy's neck. Zoo workers arrived with a fire extinguisher to keep the cats away from the boy, THV11 reports. A staffer climbed into the exhibit with a ladder to get the boy out, then handed him to his father. The boy was taken to Arkansas Children's Hospital.

– Bloomingdale's has apologized for an ad in its holiday catalog that some saw as encouraging date rape. The ad shows a woman laughing with her head turned as a young man looks her way. The text reads: "Spike Your Best Friend's Eggnog When They're Not Looking." The Wall Street Journal reports that over the past 48 hours, 3,868 social media comments have been made about the ad, most of them negative. Data from social media analytics firm Networked Insights shows that most of the comments are calling the ad "creepy." In a statement, Bloomingdale's says the ad was "inappropriate and in poor taste."

– The Catholic priest who had a long-term relationship with a California school superintendent has taken a leave of absence. Nancy Kotowski, 59, and Rev. Mike Manning, 70, are cousins on Kotowski's mother's side and did not grow up together, she tells the Monterey Herald. Manning left for the seminary when he was 14, and she was 3. "We're soul mates, and in any human relationship, especially one of over 30 years, you reach a decision-making point, and our relationship reached that point," Kotowski says. "It's a 30-year relationship of love for one another. That's what it was." Kotowski, who has never married or had children, says she and Manning are now embracing celibacy. "It's a struggle, but we know God is calling to us, so we honor that," she says.

– President Trump has taken his war of words with the Federal Reserve to a new level. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump accused Fed Chairman Jerome Powell of raising interest rates "every time we do something great" and compared his presidency to that of Barack Obama, who had "zero interest" rates from the Fed. "How the hell do you compete with that?" Trump asked. The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year, with a fourth increase likely coming at the end of the year, and Trump said he "maybe" regretted nominating Powell to the position, NBC News reports. Last week, Trump slammed the Fed as "going loco" and "out of control" and said he was "not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast." Presidents have long refrained from commenting on the Fed, which is supposed to be immune to political pressure, and Trump's remarks Tuesday were a clear break with that policy, CNN reports.

– The mother of Nia Wilson, the 18-year-old who was stabbed to death on a train in Oakland on Sunday, is speaking out after a Bay Area news station shared an image of her daughter holding what appeared to be a gun during a live broadcast. In a Facebook post, Kimberly Wilson says KTVU chose the photo of her daughter holding a cellphone case with a gun handle because it "was a basically a gag—and the local news showed it like it said something about Nia's character." "How cruel, how evil, how heartless, how crass, how foul do you have to be, how rotten must you be from the inside out, how dry and dead must your soul be—to have the idea that you want to interrupt grieving people and demean them the day after their loved one was murdered?" Kimberly Wilson writes. "They interrupt our grief because they don’t even really see us as fully human." She says the photo was a "gaffe" and accuses KTVU and other local news stations of finding a way to "demean us." Nia's killer, John Lee Cowell, was arrested Monday.

– Today's the day: The Democratic National Convention kicks off in Charlotte, and day two promises to be a busy one. Here's what you need to know: Bill Clinton will deliver the keynote speech tonight, and he's widely expected to focus on President Obama's economic record and his own in the 1990s. He'll probably start speaking after 10:30pm, USA Today reports, though it's not clear whether he'll make a "surprise" appearance with the president during his speech. Obama campaign officials downplayed questions about Clinton's speech today, calling it a "mountain out of a molehill," Bloomberg reports. "We have had lots of conversations with President Clinton," said Jim Messina. "This is a mountain out of a molehill. He's going to give a great speech tomorrow." Will he endorse Obama? "Someone in our organization is likely to see the speech before [Clinton] gives it just because that's the normal course of business," said Stephanie Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign manager. Sandra Fluke will deliver the keynote speech, and she'll touch on her controversial testimony on abortion rights, ABC News reports.

– Julian Assange is not a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of him in the new movie The Fifth Estate, and now he's written a letter to the actor to let him know it. "I believe you are a good person, but I do not believe that this film is a good film," Assange writes. "Your skills play into the hands of people who are out to remove me and WikiLeaks from the world. ... I believe that you should reconsider your involvement in this enterprise." The Hollywood Reporter has the full letter, in which Assange calls the movie "based on a deceitful book by someone who has a vendetta against me and my organization" and says it will be "overwhelmingly negative for me and the people I care about."

– On Thursday, Pope Francis is expected to deliver his first major teaching letter on the environment—and scientists say it could have a bigger impact than international negotiations on climate change this year. "The encyclical is going to go out to over 1 billion Catholics—that's a way of getting a message across to a segment of society that the scientific community could never do," Jeff Kiehl with the National Center for Atmospheric Research tells USA Today. "I mean it's just unbelievable." The New York Times reports that Francis is expected to focus on the plight of the poor in the encyclical, which the Vatican says will be issued by a Catholic cardinal, a Christian Orthodox church leader, and a climate scientist the Vatican identifies as an atheist. "This is the pope of the poor," Robert Orr, Ban Ki-moon's special adviser on climate change, tells the Times. "The fact that he is making the link to the planet is really significant." In January, Francis said science is largely settled on the causes of climate change and that greater stewardship of God's creation is necessary. "Mostly, in great part, it is man who has slapped nature in the face," he said. Catholic leaders have expressed hope that the document will transcend partisan fighting over climate change.

– Herman Cain's latest campaign ad is getting a lot of attention for a few reasons, including the chief of staff's smoking. "It has been quite a while, if ever, since we’ve seen an ad like this," notes Mediaite. "A close-up of Block speaking takes up most of the time, giving the impression that this is a normal campaign spot, until he concludes that 'together we can do this. Together we can take this country back.' Then things get weird. The end of the sentence prompts the beginning of a dramatic song with a woman proclaiming 'I AM AMERICA' (it’s a song we’ve heard before, by Krista Branch), and, for some reason, serves a cue for Block to reveal in slow motion that he is smoking a cigarette. He takes a breath and blows nicotine into the camera while Branch sings the chorus of her song. A profile of Herman Cain then fades into view, concluding one of the most bizarre 5-10 second chunks of film in some time."

– In her first public comments since the release of a 2005 tape in which her husband is heard bragging about sexually assaulting women, Melania Trump told Fox News on Tuesday that "we are moving on." "Those words, they were offensive to me and they were inappropriate. And he apologized to me. And I expect—I accept his apology. And we are moving on," she told Fox's Ainsley Earhardt, per Fox News. "My husband is kind and he's a gentleman. He cares about people. He cares about women." Earlier Monday, Melania Trump told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she believes her husband. "I believe my husband. I believe my husband," she said. "This was all organized from the opposition. And with the details ... did they ever check the background of these women? They don't have any facts." Melania Trump said she hadn't heard her husband use that kind of language before. "No. No, that's why I was surprised, because I said like I don't know that person that would talk that way, and that he would say that kind of stuff in private," she said. "I heard many different stuff—boys talk. The boys, the way they talk when they grow up and

– Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat running for governor, reveals in her new memoir that she had an abortion 17 years ago, the San Antonio Express-News reports. In Getting to Be Afraid, Davis writes that she and her then-husband decided to terminate the pregnancy of their daughter, Tate Elise, who had an acute brain abnormality. Davis writes that she felt Tate "tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her in the womb." She was delivered by cesarean section and died a day later. "An indescribable blackness followed," Davis writes. "It was a deep, dark despair and grief, a heavy wave that crushed me, that made me wonder if I would ever surface. ... And when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person. Changed. Forever changed." Davis hasn't discussed the abortion in her campaign, but the book's title is a reference to Lady Bird Johnson's line, "Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid," the Express-News notes.

– When Diana Carrillo, her sister, and two friends went to Saint Marc Pub-Cafe in Pacific City, Calif., last week, they were hoping for a shared experience. When they were seated, Carrillo says the waiter asked her, "Can I see your proof of residency?" She says she was shocked. "I already had my ID out. I couldn't say anything," she tells the Orange County Register. She turned to her sister and friends and said, "Did he just ask me that?" Carrillo says the waiter asked the other three women the same thing, saying, "I need to make sure you're residents before I serve you." After talking with the manager, who apologized, the four left. Carrillo posted her experience on social media, which has since taken on a life of its own. The restaurant posted an apology three days later that said in part, "This type of behavior is not representative of the St. Marc brand and will not be tolerated." Kent Berden, the senior director of operations at the restaurant, says he fired the waiter. He says the waiter's actions were unacceptable and not reflective of the restaurant.

– Ivins Rosier was 16 when he shot and killed Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Robert Boody's retired police dog, Drake. But the Palm Beach Post reports that Rosier was charged as an adult and went on trial this week, and yesterday a jury found him guilty of felony charges of cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm, and shooting into a building. Boody's 5-year-old German shepherd was hit in the head with a .40-caliber revolver, and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office says Rosier then confessed to killing Drake. Rosier was charged as an adult, but the law treats killing a dog differently than killing a human, the Post reports. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison.

– The Cleveland police officer who fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice last year told a grand jury on Tuesday that he shot the boy because he thought he was in an "active shooter situation," the Guardian reports. "The suspect had a gun, had been threatening others with the weapon, and had not obeyed our command to show us his hands," officer Timothy Loehmann told the grand jury. He said he told Tamir to raise his hands repeatedly as the boy was "reaching into his waistband." "I observed the suspect pulling the gun out of waistband and his elbow coming up," Loehmann said. "With his hands pulling the gun out and his elbow coming up, I knew it was a gun and it was coming out ... the threat to my partner and myself was real and active." The grand jury is considering whether to indict Loehmann, 27, and his partner, 47-year-old Frank Garmback, on charges in the death of Tamir, who was carrying a pellet gun. The officers' statements were read to the grand jury a day after Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, testified about the loss of her son. "She believes that the answer is plainly no, and hopes and prays that the grand jury agrees

– A man who lives near Oprah Winfrey's new property above Telluride, Colorado, is suing her for allegedly blocking access to hiking trails open to neighbors for decades, the AP reports. Retired physicist Charles D. Goodman claims Winfrey's Yellow Brick Road company, the property's former owners, and the town of Mountain Village made a secret deal to close access to the trails that cut across the land purchased for $10.9 million in March. The Denver Post reported Thursday that the former owners, Hoyt and Carol Barnett, asked for a correction to property records shortly before selling the land. Goodman claims that erased easements allowing residents of nearby homes to use the trails. Mountain Village denies the accusation. Town community development director Chirs Hawkins said the correction only cleared up ambiguities and that the town and Winfrey's team want to continue to allow trail access.

– The 59-year-old man who opened fire in a Lafayette, La., movie theater last night, killing two and wounding nine before killing himself, had been arrested on charges including arson and selling alcohol to a minor at least 10 to 15 years ago, police say. In Alabama, records show John Russel Houser had four speeding tickets and one no-seat ticket between 1981 and 2003, the AP reports. He also filed a small claims court lawsuit in 2004 claiming he was injured when he donated plasma at a Phenix City donation center. The case was settled, according to court records. Police officials say Houser's arrests date 10 to 15 years ago or more. Those include charges of arson and selling alcohol to a minor.

– Ralph Northam was sworn in as Virginia's 73rd governor on Saturday, and as he and his wife, first lady Pam Northam, spent their first night in the governor's mansion, they found something extra on their pillowcase: images of former governor Terry McAuliffe. McAuliffe, also a Democrat, emblazoned the pillows with one of his favorite sayings: "Sleep when you're dead." The Washington Post notes that such pranks are common in Virginia, the only state where the governorship changes hands every four years. "There are pictures of the governor all over the mansion that he left for me," Northam tells the Post. "Also, at 3 o'clock this morning, an alarm clock went off, which I have yet to find. I texted him and thanked him, and he said there was more to come."

A law enforcement official told the AP that Bello arrived at Bronx Lebanon Hospital in the Bronx on Friday with an assault rifle, which was bought in upstate New York about a week earlier, hidden under his lab coat and asked for a doctor he blamed for his having to resign, but the doctor wasn't there at the time.

He said he was "not the only person" with access to the computer in his workshop, and the extreme content did not belong to him. The Guardian reports that the court heard "nothing that supports Kim Wall being killed by my client."

– President Trump has returned to his West Palm Beach golf course on another sunny Florida day. Trump began his Friday on Twitter, saying Democrats and Republicans "MUST come together, finally, with a major Border Security package, which will include funding for the Wall." He says it's "time for action," even though the idea is opposed by many Democrats, who recently won control of the House, per the AP. Trump also calls on Congress to pass criminal justice reform legislation. He says Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer "have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country." But Trump tweeted at the wrong account, tagging a Schumer fan instead of the senator. For Thanksgiving, Trump called troops, answered reporters' questions, visited a Coast Guard station, and had dinner at his Mar-a-Lago club.

– The Secret Service is investigating after one of its agents said she wouldn't defend President Trump if someone tried to shoot him, the Washington Examiner reports. Kerry O'Grady, a senior agent in the Denver field office, made a series of now-deleted Facebook posts during the election campaign in which she called Trump a "disaster" for the country and said she wouldn't honor a federal law that prevents agents like her from publicly expressing their political beliefs. "As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act. So I keep quiet and skirt the median," she wrote in one post. "To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides. But this world has changed and I have changed. And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her." O'Grady, who oversees advance teams for all presidential trips to Washington, DC, deleted the posts shortly after they were reported by the Examiner.

The service, which the company calls a "first step in prevention," analyzes a person's DNA to determine whether they are at risk for certain diseases, including breast cancer, diabetes, and coronary heart disease. But the FDA says it doesn't meet the definition of "medical device" under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because it doesn't meet the "premarket approval" or "de novo classification" requirements, the New York Times reports. On its website, 23andMe touts the service as a "first step in prevention" that helps people "take steps toward mitigating serious diseases." But the FDA says the service "could have significant unreasonable risk of illness, genotype injury, or death to the patient due to thrombosis or bleeding events that occur from treatment with a drug at a dose that does not provide the appropriately calibrated or de novo classification." It also warns that false results could lead people to "self-manage their treatments through dose changes or even abandon certain therapies depending on the outcome of the assessment." 23andMe says it is working with the FDA to address its concerns.

– The Golden State Warriors somehow withstood LeBron James' latest brilliance on the NBA Finals stage. A costly blunder by JR Smith and a disputed foul call involving James himself sure helped. Stephen Curry scored 29 points and the Warriors capitalized on Smith's mistake that sent the game into overtime, overcoming a 51-point performance by James to beat Cleveland 124-114 in Game 1 on Thursday night, per the AP. The game nearly over, James jawed with both Curry and Klay Thompson, then Tristan Thompson and Draymond Green tangled moments later and made contact. After replay review, Tristan Thompson received a Flagrant 2 foul and ejection with 2.6 seconds left. James was in utter disbelief as regulation ended stunningly: George Hill made the first of two free throws with 4.7 seconds left after being fouled by Klay Thompson, but when Smith secured the rebound of the second, he dribbled back toward halfcourt instead of shooting, apparently thinking the Cavs had a lead. "He thought it was over. He thought we were up one," coach Tyronn Lue said. Yet Smith insisted he knew the score. Green figured Smith was simply looking for James, saying, "I would have looked for LeBron, too."

– Artificial sweeteners don't seem to help people lose weight, and they may even be linked to weight gain and an increased risk of diabetes, according to a study published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. "I think the takeaway for Canadians at this point is to maybe think twice about whether you really want to be consuming these artificial sweeteners, particularly on an everyday basis, because really we don’t have evidence to say for sure whether these are truly harmless alternatives to sugar," study co-author Meghan Azad tells the CBC. Azad and her team reviewed 37 studies that looked at the diet habits of more than 400,000 people. They found no evidence that regular consumption of artificial sweeteners helped people lose weight, only that they were linked to weight gain and increased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, and other health issues. "Surprisingly, given how common these products are, not many studies have looked at the long-term impact of their consumption," Azad tells CTV. Only seven of the studies the team reviewed were randomized controlled trials, and all were relatively short, following participants for a median period of only six months. The other 30 studies were longer and followed the participants for an average of 10 years, but they were observational studies—a form of research that is not as precise as a

– A man suspected of killing a Texas state trooper during a traffic stop was taken into custody more than 100 miles away, authorities said Thursday night. The Harris County Sheriff's Office announced on Twitter that the suspect was apprehended in neighboring Waller County. The Texas Department of Public Safety and other law enforcement agencies had identified the suspect as Dabrett Black, 32, of Linsdale, Texas, the AP reports. DPS said the trooper was shot and killed before 4pm Thursday during a traffic stop on Interstate 45 near Fairfield, about 90 miles south of Dallas. The trooper was shot with a rifle and died at the scene, the agency said. The suspect then fled. Hours after the shooting, the Waller County Sheriff's Office said the suspect's vehicle was spotted in Hempstead, about 110 miles south of Fairfield. The sheriff's office said on its Facebook page that shots were fired, but did not indicate who opened fire. The suspect was apprehended a short time later.

– Daivon Reeder's stepdad told him it was "pointless" to go to orientation at Eastern Michigan University four years ago. But on Saturday, the 22-year-old will walk with his entire EMU class and accept his diploma, the Detroit Free Press reports. Reeder, who is the first in his family to go to college, tells Fox 2 Detroit he "came back to work hard to get my scholarship back" after losing it and going to basic training for the Army. "I had family problems," he says. "I'm the oldest of all my brothers and sisters so I had to take care of my brothers and sisters back home. And I am a black male student in a predominately white university so that's a struggle in itself." Reeder, who works two jobs to support his family, formed an organization to mentor young boys. "Living our values—live, learn, teach, knowing I was living life making mistakes," he says. "But I was learning from them able to teach someone else."

– A baby's first name can have a huge impact on his or her life, according to a new book called Baby Name Report Card. The book, by Albert Mehrabian, a psychology professor in Monterey, Calif., offers advice on which names are "beneath" and "harmful"—those that "will impart positive and beneficial, rather than negative and harmful, impressions to others," according to a press release. Mehrabian's research has shown that "persons with undesirable or unattractive names tend to be handicapped in their personal, social, and work-related activities. Accordingly, it behooves parents to discover the impressions that will be generated by the names they select for their children." In his book, Mehrabian offers guidelines for choosing boys' and girls' names, as well as a list of popular-fun names for girls and popular-fun names for boys. For example, if you're looking for a boy's name that means "enthusiastic, playful, humorous, cheerful, outgoing, good-looking, adventurous, athletic, healthy," Mehrabian says you should consider Lucas. If you're looking for a girl's name that means "adorable, caring, loyal, sincere, kind, generous, respectful, warm,

– Al Gore has been out of the public eye since losing the popular vote and the White House to George W. Bush in 2000. But that doesn't mean there aren't whispers that he's thinking about running for president again. A senior Democrat tells BuzzFeed that supporters of Gore "have begun a round of conversations among themselves and with the former vice president about his running for president in 2016, the latest sign that top Democrats have serious doubts that Hillary Clinton is a sure thing." "They're figuring out if there's a path financially and politically," the Democrat says. "It feels more real than it has in the past months." A member of Gore's inner circle, however, tells BuzzFeed that "this is people talking to people, some of whom may or may not have talked to him." A Gore spokeswoman tells Politico that "there's no truth to it. He's laser-focused on solving the climate crisis."

– Reports of an explosion at Iran's Fordow nuclear site are "Western propaganda ahead of nuclear negotiations to influence their process and outcome," state news agency IRNA quoted the deputy head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization as saying yesterday. "I deny an explosion at the Fordow site," Massoud Jazayeri said, according to Reuters. Iran has accused Israel and the US of trying to sabotage its nuclear program, which Tehran says is entirely peaceful. Fordow is 300 feet underground and is immune to air strikes or bunker bombs. It contains more than 2,700 centrifuges enriching uranium to more than 20% purity. Israel, meanwhile, says it has no evidence of an explosion at Fordow, the Telegraph reports.

– Facebook is turning 10 today, and to mark the occasion, Will Oremus at Slate takes a look back at what the site looked like 10 years ago, when Mark Zuckerberg launched it in his dorm room at Harvard. "It was different because it was only for college students, featured a clean layout devoid of spam, and had no immediate plans to make money," he writes. "I assume I’ll eventually make something profitable." By December of that year, the site had 1 million users. Today, it's the world's most popular social network, with 450 million monthly users. It's also the site that brought us News Feed, the like button, and the Beacon feature, which allowed users to give gifts to their friends. But it's not all fun and games. "In the next decade, we have the opportunity and responsibility to connect everyone and to keep serving the community as best we can," Zuckerberg says in a statement. Harvard, meanwhile, is still working on its own version of the site.

– Hillary Clinton made a move to court Bernie Sanders' supporters Saturday with a plan to expand funding for community health care centers, USA Today reports. "The proposal brought forth today by Secretary Clinton, working with our campaign, is an important step forward in expanding healthcare in America—and expanding health insurance and healthcare access to tens of millions of Americans," Sanders said in a statement. "I congratulate Secretary Clinton for this extremely important initiative." The plan would double funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers, which serve populations with limited access to health care. Community health care centers have been a key priority for Sanders, I-Vt., who successfully fought for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for such centers in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Clinton also reaffirmed her commitment to giving Americans in every state the choice of a "public-option" insurance plan, Reuters reports. Clinton's plan would increase mandatory health-care funding under the ACA by $40 billion over the next decade.

"People don't realize how tough it is to come from nothing when you don't have any family or any friends." Hagenston, who goes by the name "Honest Abe," has been homeless for 10 years and panhandles in Detroit's Woodward Square every day, accepting credit and debit cards with a reader attached to his cell phone, CBS Detroit reports. "I'm only homeless guy in America who can take a credit card," Hagenston says. "It's safe and securely through square." He says he and a group of fellow homeless have organized themselves "like a union" to panhandle in shifts and have figured out a way to make donations more efficient. "I take VISA, MasterCard, American Express," Hagenston says. "I'm only homeless guy in America who can take a credit card." He says that without the extra cash, he hasn't made enough money this winter to buy new eyeglasses and a new prescription, and he could use a new prescription. He also has a website where people can donate to a collection of homeless people or report fake panhandlers. "I'm

– Police have arrested a man accused of stealing a teenager's "Make America Great Again" hat and throwing a drink in his face at a Whataburger in Texas, the AP reports. In a video posted to Facebook Wednesday, the man can be seen taking off the hat from 16-year-old Hunter Richard and walking away from a group of teens. In a statement, Whataburger says it was "shocked to see this video and certainly don't condone this type of customer behavior in our restaurants." The San Antonio Police Department says Kino Jimenez, 30, was arrested at his home and charged with theft. Hunter's mother, Patricia Spittler, posted the video to Facebook asking for help identifying the "scum bag of the year." "His friend was wearing a patriotic hat, and this happened!" she wrote. "It would be nice to know who he is for someone to let him know his actions are not okay! Real tough guy ... approaches a group of teenagers minding their own business just having a burger! He kept his hat, too." The video has been viewed more than 2 million times and sparked outrage online, Business Insider reports. The teenager's hat was returned and he told WOAI-TV that he supports President Trump.

– At least 13 people, including children, died after a boat carrying tourists capsized and sank on a lake during a thunderstorm in a country music mecca in southwest Missouri, authorities said Friday. Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Jason Pace said four people remain missing Friday after the Ride the Ducks boat sank on Table Rock Lake in Branson Thursday evening. He said 14 people survived, and that seven of them were injured. Patrol divers found two more bodies early Friday, raising the death toll from 11 to 13, Pace said. A spokeswoman for the Cox Medical Center Branson said four adults and three children arrived at the hospital shortly after the incident. Two adults are in critical condition and the others were treated for minor injuries, Brandei Clifton said. Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader said five people remain missing and seven others were hospitalized after a Ride the Ducks boat sank on Table Rock Lake in Branson. Another duck boat on the lake made it safely back to shore, the AP reports. Rader said the stormy weather was believed to be the cause of the capsizing.

– President Obama's news conference today laid out his case for ending the Bush tax cuts for the rich, and most pundits seem to agree that it worked. Here's what they're saying: "The primary goal of President Obama’s presser, which just wrapped up, was obvious: He was clearly out to pick a major public fight with Republicans over tax cuts for the rich," writes Ezra Klein in the Washington Post. Obama mounted a surprisingly aggressive moral case for ending high end tax cuts, casting it as a test of our society’s priorities, and argued— crucially—that anyone who fails to support ending them is fundamentally unserious about the deficit. He also went out of his way to highlight GOP opposition to raising revenues by ending a perk for corporate jet owners. This proposal would raise only $3 billion, which means it’s trivial in the larger scheme of things, and Obama’s mention of it seemed deliberately designed to provoke howls of outrage and cries of "class warfare" from Republicans—with the obvious goal of maneuvering Republicans into the role of arch defenders of the interests of the wealthy." "While we should keep in mind that Obama did ultimately cut a deal on the high-end tax cuts last time around, those who are hoping he will

– Phillip Boyle and Jamie Blyth went out for a "quiet pint" Friday night in Marton, England, and stayed up all night throwing back some "the finest alcoholic beverages that Northern England has to offer," as Boyle puts it to the GazetteLive. The next morning, Boyle's friend Jamie Blyth started asking if he had his passport, then called a cab to take the whole hungover group to the Manchester Airport. "When we got in the taxi we didn't even have flights. It's a last minute bad idea—but one of those bad ideas that turns into a good idea," Boyle continues. "I nearly canceled when [we were] on the way to Manchester Airport and realized this is all a bit rash and nothing was booked. But they followed their best (worst?) instincts and bought tickets to Pattaya, Thailand, two seven-hour flights interrupted by a layover in Abu Dhabi. Boyle said that he didn't even pack a real suitcase, he just stuffed some t-shirts and some clean underwear in a grocery bag. After 14 hours and 6,750 miles, the group landed in the beachside city, where they planned to stay until Tuesday. "No one's misbehaved," he said. Boyle had initially jetted out with just

– Sean Penn says Kate del Castillo's El Chapo documentary series is "nothing but a cheap, National Enquirer-esque tale spun be a delusional person whose hunger for fame is both tawdry and transparent." Per Deadline, Penn has come up empty in his attempts to block The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story, a three-episode series that depicts Penn's infamous 2015 meeting with drug lord Joaqu ⁇ n Guzm ⁇ n Loera. In a statement, a rep for Penn calls the series "reprehensible that, in their ongoing, relentless efforts to gain additional attention and publicity, Ms. del Castillo and her team (who have zero firsthand knowledge) have sought to create this profoundly false, foolish, and reckless narrative." The rep continues: "The notion that Mr. Penn or anyone on his behalf alerted DOJ to the trip is a complete fabrication and bald-faced lie. It never happened, nor would there have been any reason for it to have happened." A source tells Deadline that Penn wanted to see the series before he agreed to participate, and when he finally did, he asked for it to be edited to more closely reflect what he said was the truth. Lawyers for Penn also informed Netflix in correspondence that the actor was

He also told his followers to tune in for more of the controversy.

– Israeli police have arrested a 19-year-old Jewish male in connection with a wave of bomb threats made against US, Australian, and New Zealand Jewish institutions, the New York Times reports. According to CNN, the suspect holds dual American-Israeli citizenship. He was arrested in southern Israel after an undercover FBI agent posing as a potential recruit placed a call to a Jewish community center in the city of Ashkelon. Police say the suspect used "advanced camouflage technologies" to hide his identity. The FBI confirmed the arrest and said it could not provide further information. More than 100 bomb threats were made against Jewish institutions in the US, Australia, and New Zealand this year. They were made against schools and community centers in 33 states and most came as part of five waves.

– A federal judge's ruling that the Obama health law is unconstitutional has landed like a stink bomb among Republicans, who've seen the politics of health care flip as Americans increasingly value the overhaul's core parts, including protections for pre-existing medical conditions and Medicaid for more low-income people. While the decision by the Republican-appointed judge in Texas was sweeping, it has little immediate practical impact because the Affordable Care Act remains in place while the legal battle continues, possibly to the Supreme Court, the AP reports. HealthCare.gov, the government's site for signing up, was taking applications Saturday, the deadline in most states for enrolling for coverage next year, and those benefits will take effect as scheduled Jan. 1. Medicaid expansion will proceed in Virginia, one of the latest states to accept that option. Employers will still be required to cover the young adult children of workers, and Medicare recipients will still get discounted prescription drugs. But Republicans, still stinging from their loss of the House in the midterm elections, are facing a fresh political quandary after US District Judge Reed O'Connor said the entire 2010 health law was invalid. Warnings about the Texas lawsuit were part of the political narrative behind Democrats' electoral gains. Health care was the top issue for about one-fourth

– Ireland's parliament has passed the country's first bill on abortion, legalizing the procedure in cases of rape, incest, and when the mother's life is in danger. The bill allows abortions in cases where the mother's life is in danger (but not in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's health is in danger) or when the fetus has serious health defects (but not in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger). Abortion is already legal in Ireland, where the only time it's not allowed is in cases of rape or when the mother's life is in danger of serious bodily harm. The bill passed by a vote of 127 to 31, despite threats of excommunication from cardinals and bishops, the Guardian reports. Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Dublin yesterday to oppose the bill, the AP reports.

– A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and olive oil may help you live longer, a new study suggests. Researchers found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with longer telomeres, which protect the DNA code at the ends of our chromosomes, the BBC reports. Telomere length has been linked to a wide range of age-related diseases, including heart disease and cancer. " Telomere length is considered to be a biomarker of aging; shorter telomeres are associated with a decreased life expectancy and increased rates of developing age-related chronic diseases," the researchers write in the British Medical Journal. "Given that fruits, vegetables, and nuts, key components of the Mediterranean diet, have well known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and that telomere length is affected by both of these processes, we hypothesized that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet would be associated with longer telomere length." The researchers tracked the health of nearly 5,000 nurses over more than a decade, and found that those who largely stuck to the Mediterranean diet had longer telomeres. "These results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing heart disease," the British Heart Foundation says.

– A seriously ill woman in El Salvador has had a successful cesarean section to deliver a baby that doctors have given little chance of surviving. The 22-year-old woman, known only as Beatriz, underwent the operation in the afternoon after 27 weeks of pregnancy, the ministry said. Her baby girl was born without a brain. "No one can say how long she will live," Morena Herrera of the Feminist Collective for Local Development told the AP. "It was painful to see the little creature. That's what the grandmother told us, and the doctors confirmed it." The country's Supreme Court last week prohibited an abortion for Beatriz, who suffers from lupus and kidney failure and whose lawyers said the pregnancy was threatening her life. Her plight drew international attention and a ruling from the Inter-American Court on Human Rights that El Salvador should protect her life and help her end the pregnancy. The Health Ministry stepped in late last week after the ruling and said it would allow the C-section because the pregnancy was already at 26 weeks and the country's strict abortion laws were no longer at play. El Salvador has some of the toughest abortion laws in Latin America, along with Chile, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Suriname.

The clashes broke out after pro-Morsi supporters tore down tents at a protest outside the presidential palace, the Los Angeles Times reports. More than 200 protesters camped outside the palace were broken up by the pro-Morsi contingent, which included ultraconservative Salafis. Mohamed ElBaradei tweeted: "Vicious attack vs. peaceful protesters in front of presidential palace.Regime leading Egypt into violence and bloodshed."

– Ebola kills between 10% and 80% of people who contract the virus, with symptoms including fever, bleeding, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing problems, and difficulty swallowing, Gizmodo reports. But a new study published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases shows that up to 25% of people who contract the virus don't show any of the typical symptoms, meaning they're asymptomatic, or their symptoms are relatively mild and not wholly reflective of how the virus affects most people. In other words, they have "minimally symptomatic infections." Gene Richardson and his team tested 187 men, women, and children in the village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone for Ebola after they were exposed to the virus either because they lived in the same household or shared a public toilet with a person known to have had the disease. Of these, 14 were found to carry an antibody to Ebola—a sure sign they were infected at some point. The researchers aren't sure if an asymptomatic person with Ebola can transmit the virus. "They were not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhea," Richardson says in a statement. "It's unclear if they can pass it along it sexually." More research is needed to determine if Ebola can be spread by a person who shows no or

"You know I’m shy and retiring, and I don’t like to speak my mind," the New Jersey governor joked. But he also reminded the crowd of his anti-abortion bona fides, his record of taking on public-sector unions, and his record of governing in a blue state, the Washington Post reports. "Governors are about getting things done," he said. "Republican governors in this country have stood up and done things—not just talked about them."

– Donald Trump held a closed-door meeting with dozens of black pastors on Monday, and the results were not pretty. Politico reports that the pastors—who were supposed to endorse him at a press conference—demanded that Trump apologize to the black community and to Mexicans for his inflammatory rhetoric. "Our community really wants him to be sensitive with the way he handles people and they feel he's insensitive," says Bishop Orrin Pullings, a Virginia-based pastor. "We told him that you are insensitive in appearance to our community and that's not a good position. He listened to us and you know, I think Donald Trump is a very good listener." Trump, however, says the pastors didn't ask him to tone down his rhetoric. "The tone has taken me to first position in every single poll," he tells Politico. "The beautiful thing about the meeting is they didn't ask me to change the tone." According to pullings, there was also disagreement at the meeting about Trump's mocking of a New York Times reporter's handicap. "Another crowd said, 'No, you should never apologize. You're ahead in the polls now because of your big mouth. You start apologizing, you've got to keep apologizing,

– There's a new invasive plant in town, and it's making its way across the US from Canada. The CBC reports on the giant hogweed, an "amphibious" plant native to the Great Lakes that's grown to the size of a grapefruit and can grow to be more than a foot tall. It was first spotted in North America in the mid-'90s, and it's been making its way up the East Coast over the last few years. Most recently, it showed up in New York's Central Park earlier this year, according to the New York Daily News. "I've lived in New York my whole life, and I've never seen anything like this," one resident tells the Daily News. "It's kind of mind-boggling." The New York City Department of Environmental Protection says the plant has been spotted in every county in the state, as well as in Washington, DC, and in some areas as far away as South Carolina. The EPA says the best way to get rid of the plant is through "manual, mechanically, and with herbicides," but it will take a few years for it to show up in your soil. The best way to get rid of it is to cut it off

– A 37-year-old American citizen has been recaptured 16 years after escaping a Texas prison. Juan Salaz was captured in Mexico and is awaiting extradition to the US to finish serving his sentence on charges of attempted capital murder of a police officer, reports the AP. Salaz escaped the night of March 22, 1997, from the Garza East prison in Beeville by climbing over three 16-foot fences all topped with razor wire. At the time, he was serving three concurrent 35-year sentences for aggravated kidnapping with a deadly weapon and two counts of attempted capital murder of a police officer for a 1995 incident involving two Houston officers. Prison officials said sources for years had told them Salaz was hiding out in Mexico but he managed to evade police. The hunt for him involved the US Marshals Service, the Texas prison system's Office of Inspector General, and Mexican law enforcement agencies. "Salaz thought that he had eluded authorities by starting a new life in Mexico," said a Texas official. "He was wrong." Salaz is to be returned to Texas custody once the Mexican government approves his extradition.

– Tony Trapani, 81, was cleaning out his wife's filing cabinet after her death when he found a 1959 letter from the mother of his long-lost son. "I have a little boy. He is five years old now. What I'm trying to say Tony is he is your son," the letter reads, per the New York Daily News. "He's my full son that I've had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me," Trapani tells WMXI. His son, Samuel Childress, now 61, says his mother told him she sent the letter, but he assumed Trapani just ignored it. He grew up in Pennsylvania thinking his father never wanted to meet him. "I always asked my mom, I said, 'Well what does he look like?' She said, 'Well, go look in the mirror,'" Childress says. "Just to know him now is so important to me. It's going to fill that void." Trapani says he doesn't know why his wife didn't tell him about the letter. "She wanted children. She couldn't have any. She tried and tried," he says.

The Facebook board member and prominent Silicon Valley investor tweeted late Tuesday that he supports "Internet colonialism" in the wake of India's decision to ban Facebook's "Free Basics" Internet service, the Wall Street Journal reports. "Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?" Andreessen wrote in a since-deleted tweet picked up by Quartz and Business Insider. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg quickly distanced himself from Andreessen's comments. "I found the comments deeply upsetting, and they do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all," he wrote on Facebook. "We strongly reject the sentiments expressed by Marc Andreessen last night regarding India."

– If you're going to get engaged on Facebook, you might want to make sure it's in the first picture you post. Miranda Levy did just that when she shared a photo of herself and her fiance with the caption, "I'm happy regardless of material things," the Independent reports. But her friends were more interested in what was in the bottom left corner of the photo: a pregnancy test. So she posted, "Hey we're having a baby, too," according to KFOR.

– Ron Paul's declaration that "we are all Austrians now" has led to a lot of confusion. The term "Austrian economics" has a double meaning, writes Matthew Yglesias at Slate. It refers to the thinking of Ludwig von Mises and his student Murray Rothbard. Austrians, Yglesias writes, " reject the idea that there is anything at all the government can do to stabilize macroeconomic fluctuations. This, to be clear, is different from the mainstream Republican view that the stimulus bill enacted by Congress in 2009 and signed into law by President Obama was wasteful or ineffective. ... It may seem 'obvious' that the decline in housing activity caused the current recession, in line with the Austrian view, but the Austrians have replicated an error from the crudest forms of postwar Keynesianism—the failure to consider the role of expectations feedback in macroeconomic policy." It's also hard to understand why businesspeople would be so easily duped in this way. "If Ron Paul and Ludwig von Mises know that cheap money can’t last forever, why don’t private investors?"

– President Obama's decision to fire the acting commissioner of the IRS and declassify the Benghazi emails may have seemed like a quick fix yesterday, but it's not enough to save his second-term agenda, writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. Republicans, he writes, are "going to remain on the attack—and they’re upping their demands." Still, Democrats say the White House has "found the footing" after days of anxiety. "Our goal since Monday night when the AP revelation poured accelerant on the fire has been to tackle each of the three issues separately but forcefully and get back on offense as soon as possible," an Obama aide tells Politico. "That wasn’t possible on Tuesday because we didn’t have the IG report and would not have been able to take decisive action at the IRS and we needed to get the emails declassified, which took time and pushed us into Wednesday."

– Two months after 43 students disappeared in Iguala, Mexico, allegedly at the hands of drug gangs, President Enrique Pe ⁇ a Nieto announced an anti-crime plan yesterday that would give state authorities control over municipal police forces and dissolve local governments infiltrated by gangs, the AP reports. "Mexico cannot go on like this," he said. "After Iguala, Mexico must change." The president's plan would also relax the complex divisions between which offenses are dealt with at federal, state, and local levels. At present, some local police refuse to act to prevent federal crimes like drug trafficking. It would also seek to establish a national identity number or document, though it was unclear what form that would take. The plan would focus first on four of Mexico's most troubled states— Guerrero, Michoacan, Jalisco, and Tamaulipas. More federal police and other security forces would be sent to the "hot land" region overlapping the first two states, where the government has already sent significant contingents of federal police and soldiers. "My response to the police operation in the 'hot lands' is: 'What? Another one?'" said Mexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope, alluding to a string of previous anti-crime initiatives in

– Boston's New England Holocaust Memorial was vandalized for the second time this summer, just two days after a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. Police say a 17-year-old threw a rock Monday evening through one of the glass panels at the memorial, which bears the numbers that Nazis tattooed on concentration camp victims, the Boston Globe reports. The teen was tackled by two bystanders and held until police arrived. He is charged with willful destruction of property, and police are investigating whether the incident was a hate crime. The memorial, which was installed in 1995, had never been vandalized before June.

– Jonathan Pollard, who was sentenced to life in prison in 1987 for spying for Israel, will be released on parole Nov. 21, his lawyer announced Tuesday. The New York Times reports the 60-year-old will leave federal prison in Butner, NC, that same day. Pollard's lawyer, Eliot Lauer, calls it a "miracle" and says he's "thrilled and grateful." According to CNN, Pollard's release could help ease tensions between the US and Israel that have been raised over the Iran nuclear deal.

– Scott Weiland's ex-wife wants to be named the executor of the late Stone Temple Pilots frontman's will. Mary Forsberg, who was his second wife from 1994 to 2000 and has two children with his first wife, Janina Castenada, filed court documents on Dec. 30 asking to be named the executor of Weiland's will, which was written in April 2007, right around the time Forsberg's marriage to Weiland fell apart, TMZ reports. The Stone Temple Pilots frontman had about $2 million in assets as part of his estate and also created a trust that has undisclosed assets. Weiland's widow, Jamie Wachtel, was with him for two years before his death on Dec. 3 at the age of 48. A hearing has been set for Feb. 5.

– The Senate has sent the House a short-term spending bill that will keep the government funded—but not defund ObamaCare. The bill, which funds the government through Oct. 1, passed the Senate 68-31, with all Democrats voting in favor. The bill now goes to the House, where Republicans are divided between those who want to defund ObamaCare and those who want to keep it intact, the New York Times reports. John Boehner's office says the House "will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want the train wreck that is ObamaCare," the Hill reports. But the Tea Party is not happy. "He’s going to be threatened," conservative activist Brent Bozell tells the Hill. "If he chooses to side with Barack Obama and with the Democrats in order to fund ObamaCare, then he owns ObamaCare and he can’t get out of that. He’ll be as responsible for ObamaCare as Harry Reid."

– "We stood there crying—filming with tears rolling down our cheeks." That's how nature photographer Paul Nicklen tells National Geographic about a video he made over the summer of a starving polar bear on an island in a Canadian territory in the Arctic Circle. Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy were on Somerset Island, near the larger Baffin Island, in late summer when they came across the bear, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear's back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground. The video was shot by Nicklen, a nature photographer and contributor to the National Geographic magazine for the last 17 years. He is also a biologist by training and the co-founder of Sea Legacy, a nonprofit that uses storytelling and images to advocate for the environment. Nicklen's video, which he shot on a trip for Sea Legacy, depicts an emaciated polar bear, its coat patchy, seemingly near death on an island in a Canadian territory inside the Arctic Circle. It searches for food in a rusted garbage can

– David Petraeus' affair with Jill Kelley may have gotten him in trouble with the feds, but not for leaking classified information. Federal prosecutors have recommended that he be charged for mishandling classified information, reports NBC News. No charges have been filed yet, and it's up to Eric Holder to decide whether the facts of the case merit going to court. The New York Times, which first reported the recommendation, notes that investigators concluded that the affair amounted to a "significant security breach in the office of one of the nation’s most trusted intelligence leaders."

– Alisha and Pete Arnold have been blogging about their third pregnancy at birthornot.com—and now they've decided to poll the public on whether they should give birth or have an abortion. At the top of the blog is a poll hosted by PollDaddy.com. Should we give birth or have an abortion? At the moment, "Give Birth" has 46% of the vote and "Have an Abortion" 54%. The Arnolds say the poll won't be binding, "but it will carry a lot more weight." "It's kind of like Congress. They might vote for something, but the president has the final veto," Pete tells Gawker. "If it's overwhelming one way or the other, that will carry a lot more weight."

– "This has been the most amazing Thanksgiving that our family could ever ask for," Sheila Koester tells the Sacramento Bee. "We're all very, very, very excited, very, very relieved, and just very thankful for getting our Sherri back." Relatives say Sherri Papini has been reunited with her husband after the 34-year-old was found alive on the side of a California road early Thanksgiving morning. Papini, who went missing after going for a jog on Nov. 2, is "very happy to be together," Koester says. "And that they are very happy to be together and they're very thankful for everyone for allowing them to have their privacy and allowing them to recover from their situation that all of us have been in." Police say Papini was bound with restraints when she was released from a vehicle near a freeway interchange in Yolo County and flagged down a passing car. "CHP is on scene and advised that she is chained to something," a radio dispatcher told a responding officer in an audio clip obtained by the Bee. "CHP is advising that she is heavily battered." Police say they are searching for two women armed with a handgun.

– In the wake of the mass shooting in Oregon, Hillary Clinton on Monday unveiled what the New York Times calls a "sweeping plan" to reduce gun violence. Among other things, she wants to close the background-check loophole that allows private sellers to sell guns to people who aren't licensed to sell them, and she wants to revoke the licenses of gun dealers who knowingly supply "straw purchasers," the Times reports. Clinton's campaign says she will take executive action to close the loophole via a new rule from the ATF that would more clearly define what it means to be "engaged in the business" of selling guns, the Washington Post reports. A gun policy expert at the Center for American Progress tells the Post that Clinton is right to take executive action, but it would be "very hard to prosecute people who abuse the law and are selling tens and hundreds of guns as private sellers."

– When the St. Roch set sail from Vancouver, BC, in 1700, it was supposed to be the first ship to traverse the Northwest Passage and the Panama Canal. Instead, it's now the subject of a major exhibit at the Great Maritime Museum, which tells the story of the ship, its crew, and Canada's maritime history, the CBC reports. Inside the ship, you'll find artifacts including a life preserver from the St. Roch's deck, which once held the remains of an Inuit family that lived on board. There's even a remote-controlled submersible that you can control with buttons on the side of the display. "I'm normally not a huge museum fan but this one is very unique and focuses mostly on the maritime history of Vancouver and Canada as a whole," one visitor writes on TripAdvisor. "The ship inside is very cool to climb around and explore. It's crazy to me that an Inuit family lived on deck to help the sailors while on an expedition."

– The Islamic State has released a new video that purports to show the execution of five men it says were spies for the UK, the BBC reports. In the 10-minute video, a man speaks with British accents and threatens attacks in the UK before shooting the men in the back of the head. At the end of the video, a young boy, believed to be around 6 or 7 years old, is seen talking about killing "unbelievers." Authorities are trying to identify the masked man and confirm if he is British, the BBC reports. The release of the video comes less than two months after the killing of ISIS propagandist Mohammed Emwazi in a drone strike in Syria, USA Today reports.

– A hole in the roof of a Southwest Airlines plane forced an emergency landing in Yuma, Ariz., yesterday, but no one was seriously injured when the 15-year-old Boeing 737-300 plummeted from 35,000 feet to about 20,000 feet in 5 minutes. The airline has grounded 80 of its Boeing 737-300s so that they can be inspected, and hundreds of flights have been canceled today as a result, the AP reports. Flight attendants had just begun to take drink orders when the explosion rocked the cabin, reports the AP.

– Michigan's attorney general filed involuntary manslaughter charges Wednesday against six state and local officials over the Flint water crisis, including Gov. Rick Snyder's former chief of staff. The charges—the first levied in a probe that's expected to broaden—included official misconduct, evidence tampering, and neglect of duty, the Detroit Free Press reports. The charges are related to the city's tap water, which was found to be contaminated with lead after the city switched to the Flint River for its water as a cost-cutting move in 2014. Prosecutors say that after the city's utilities were declared bankrupt in 2014, Snyder ordered the switch to the Flint River to save money. The new charges are in addition to the five involuntary manslaughter charges filed last month, the AP reports. The other officials charged were the city's utilities administrator, an emergency manager, and two teachers who worked for the city, the Detroit News reports. Snyder, who blames state officials for the crisis, was not charged.

– The Pentagon has made contingency plans to send special operations troops to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles if President Obama decides they need to be protected, senior US officials tell the Los Angeles Times. The plan would likely involve stealthy raids by special operations teams and airstrikes to destroy the chemicals without dispersing them in the air. US satellites and drone aircraft already maintain partial surveillance of the sites, the officials say. Experts say the chemical agents are stored in bunkers and other sites around the country. Four production facilities are near the cities of Aleppo, Hama, and Homs, all tinderboxes in the 17-month uprising, as well as the coastal city of Latakia, an area considered a stronghold for Assad's Alawite religious sect. An unclassified report by the director of national intelligence this year said Syria's chemical agents "can be delivered by aerial bombs, ballistic missiles, and artillery rockets." But Syrian rockets, including Scud missiles procured from North Korea, are notoriously inaccurate, making them ineffective for delivering a heavy concentration of toxic chemicals to a specific target. "The actual killing may be less important than the panic they would induce," said Leonard Spector, who heads the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. Analysts say it'

– Super PACs may have cost Newt Gingrich the Iowa caucuses, but they didn't cost him the Supreme Court case that opened the door to super PACs in the first place, reports the Christian Science Monitor. Gingrich still supports the court decision, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, but he says he's not the victim of the decision. "I'm the victim of one particular person, Mitt Romney, whose staff went out and decided to run a deliberately negative and dishonest campaign," he said. Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig, meanwhile, tells Democracy Now that he's in favor of amending the Constitution to limit big-money influence on elections. "I'm not the victim of that," he said. "I'm the victim of one particular person, Mitt Romney, whose staff went out and decided to run a deliberately negative and dishonest campaign."

– Taylor Swift's new video for "Shake It Off" is out tomorrow, and in a new interview with Rolling Stone, she explains why it's such a huge hit: It's the first single from 1989 and the first time she's performed it at the VMAs. "It's the first time I've ever performed it at the VMAs," she says. "I'm like, 'Oh my God. I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to do that,'" she continues. "And then it's like, 'Oh my God. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to do that,' and then it's, 'Oh my God. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to do that,'" she says.
