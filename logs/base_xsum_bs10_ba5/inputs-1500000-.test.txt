SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 Congress finds the following:
 (1) As the world's largest economy, the United States has 
 an enormous stake in the future of the global trading system.
 (2) Exports are a crucial force driving the United States 
 economy and job creation.
 (3) While nearly 97 percent of United States exporters are 
 small and medium enterprises (SMEs), SMEs account for just over 
 one-fourth of exports, leaving much room for growth.
 (4) Two-thirds of United States exporters have fewer than 
 20 employees and sell to just one foreign market.
 (5) Manufacturers account for 61 percent of total United 
 States exports with small manufacturers accounting for 
 approximately 15 percent of total United States exports. Thirty 
 percent of small manufacturers do not currently export but 
 would consider doing so if they had more help in securing vital 
 information on foreign markets, customers, and export 
 procedures.
 (6) United States small and medium enterprises face tough 
 competition from trading partners of the United States that 
 aggressively undertake export promotion programs that directly 
 support and underwrite the expanded growth in trade of their 
 small and medium enterprises.
 (7) United States trade promotion is carried out in part by 
 21 departments and agencies of the Federal Government. 
 Representatives from these Federal departments and agencies are 
 members of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC), a 
 Federal committee that has not lived up to congressional intent 
 to provide a seamless offering of export promotion products and 
 services due in part to the inadequate allocation of resources 
 and a lack of ultimate decision making budget input authority 
 to ensure effective results are achieved for the invested 
 resources.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

 The purpose of this Act and the amendments made by this Act is to 
improve the performance and results of trade promotion policies and 
programs of the Federal Government in accordance with the Government 
Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-62).
