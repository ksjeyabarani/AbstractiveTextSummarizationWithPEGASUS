so our french teacher asked us to make an interview in french as a proyect, my friends and i made a pretty long video (compared to the other teams) in which i added a lot of memes when i edited it, and also i uploaded it to youtube (http://youtu.be/vy0p71xapms skip to minute 4, the first moments are really boring), then i sended it to our teacher, which had a blast watching it, but my friends and i had fear that we were going to show it to all the class, and that's exactly what happened.
-----:1
the sheets could not be changed as that would be obvious, like the stains. why one would need mayonnaise or something else for popcorn i'm not sure. and they were not oblivious to the various stains which were obviously not caused by the popcorn nor drinks we had.
-----:2
thats it really...
anyways, its 2nd to last stop and a woman with a pram comes on with the cutest little shit you could imagine.
-----:3
so i'm housesitting this week and decided it would be a good time to see if the car even runs (i'm pretty sure she hasn't driven it in over a year, so the gas is probably bad). so i thought i would try to remove the key (that's supposed to be stuck) from the ignition. she somehow got it in her ignition and got it to start her car. .my aunt comes back in like 3 days so i've got some time but right now i'm freaking the hell out.
-----:4
for a moment i thought that this is quite weird and doesn’t sound legit at all but hey as the stupid a** that i am i thought ok let’s do it... we did the trade and after a few minutes he meant that there aren’t any items like mine in the inventory of the bots and that the only way i could recover my value of skins was to give him some of my other skins and he would change the odds of the homepage in a way that i would win a really valuable knife in the next game with a 100% certainty... sounds ridiculous right?
-----:5
so it all went good but then around 8pm i started to get really sleepy, and laied down. it was around 12pm and they had gotten home, all drunk, yelling at me to go get the girl.
-----:6
with sarah was her friend who i had barely spoken to before, she seemed really nice and i quite liked her.
-----:7
"are you going to work?"
"no i'm going to shower and go to the hospital"
"oh ok, i was really scared you would go to work first"
"no dad...i hate you in the hospital i rather be with you" .

-----:8
.
i went downstairs to rejoin my friends and nearly collapsed in agony as the full brunt of the jalape ⁇ o holocaust hit me.
-----:9
i walk in the bathroom and see the stalls don't have doors, which isn't something particularly great for me as i could tell it was going to be.. after about 20 more minutes of being in the ocean i see police cars and crowds of people start to pull up to the bathroom.
-----:10
that was on monday, and i've just now realised i've been stealing public transport for about half a week when i looked through my wallet and found my debit card, but not my myki.
-----:11
ahh ok well i made eye contact with her at her strip cub yadda yadda yadda yadda she takes me to a private area for dances, i told her i only wanted 3, after my time was up i asked her if she did any off the clock work she said yes then gave me her number, i said fuck it can i have another dance. when i whent to work on monday i told my work friend r what i had done he was cool about it, three days later i tell a another friend s..
-----:12
my brothers are twins and they're 8 years old. this caught my brothers' attention quickly, and they abandoned their soccer game to watch wwe with me while i explained the rules and told them about my favorite wrestlers. my brothers, being 8 years old, didn't know the *other* meaning of the word horny, so in their minds they had no reason not to say it.
 they were on the ground pushing each other around, after one of my little brothers announced to the entire checkout area that he's horny.
-----:13
i go to the bathroom pee and decide i'm also thirsty so i'm going to head to the kitchen and get a drink. as i'm getting my drink i think i hear something outside, most likely nothing but i'm a little startled since i can't hear so well with my ear plugs in.
-----:14
well we quickly recognize each other (went to a smallish private high school) talk a bit here and there no more than outside of class, but got along pretty well. well, i hadn't been on facebook in quite a while and i noticed they had some new features, you can attach a file, chat settings, and they added a whole bunch of new emoticons in a separate window.
-----:15
i called my dad and showed him the four plates, asking him if he saw the same numbers. the student said "i only see one number from these pictures." pleased that someone else also said the same, my father gloated and said to his co-workers, "see? from time to time though i do forget that he is color-blind, telling him to get the red thingy or the violet thingy or that the red thing or the violet thingy is his like "your toothbrush is violet and mine is blue." .

-----:16
chinese subways are typically very crowded during rush hours, so no matter how shaky things get people don't ever fall over because one would just end up leaning against another body. a few stops later, this gorgeous woman stepped on to the train and decided to stand near me. i popped a piece of gum in my mouth and dozed off for a while leaning against the door.

-----:17
recently i feel like i've been inching out of the friend zone, so i've been trying to flirt and impress her a bit more.

-----:18
last month i had a terrible experience with my 2nd primary care physician (let's call him dr.g) since moving away from my primary of five years. he tells me basically i need to get a new primary care physician because he's only going to give me "basic service." apparently i'm a car in need of an oil change. he gives me my xyz prescription of pain medication and i make calls at my insurance company to get a new primary care physician.
-----:19
i'm very much so straight and had no intention of this happening but seeing as life is a bitch i guess we can't always get what we want.
 i was raised with a dog and having one to play with and pet on and love and get love from was a great deal to me. i start to crouch down and jesus god if there isn't the fireplace rack for the broom thing and the poker and that lovely shit sitting right where my ass was going.
-----:20
you drank some flat coke, so what?" but here's where the problem is: it wasn't simply flat. ann was a bit weird; she smoked a lotta weed in an illegal state, had a water bed, was in her late sixties, had her house paid off, lived alone. she invited us to go have some homemade ice-cream. okay, i'll just go run around (this is in a rather rural state, everyone around us has huge amounts of land.) so i was just running around a creek, hitting rotten sticks, and the like.

-----:21
when i opened the door, i couldn't help but notice the entire lobby of the college building that was usually full of people was completely empty. so, i make my way through the empty halls to the room where my class usually is and couldn't help but say "what the fuck?" out loud when i noticed the lights in the classroom were out and the door was locked.

-----:22
i swapped the battery and left the detector to find some ear plugs and test the new battery when the room suddenly started to smell funny.
-----:23
at this point i felt that this was my last chance to get my stretched earlobes back to its old size. (it's easier to re-stretch if not to much time has passed) i wasn't really ready to get rid of them, and convinced myself that i could easily get rid of them at any time because of my amazing healing capabilities. "i might as well re-stretch them back now before it's too late!"
and so i followed through and tried to jam my old plugs back into my stupid shrunken hole, and i managed to force the fucker back in.
-----:24
i didn't really get a good breakfast, so i go to buy a snack from the vending machine ( i didn't want to starve before dinner) after carefull consideration, i decide on a tuna sandwich. my mom glanses at me like im the pickiest little brat in the world, and tells me that "it's ok as long as it smells good." the sandwich doesn't really smell at all, so i ignore it and finish up. i try to go to sleep, but my dad is snooring like a fucking locomotive, so it's an impossible feat.
-----:25
.q showed me a message he recieved from a girl he had not so recently started talking to, telling about how she had helped my friend g cheat on his girlfriend. after tough decision making and a lengthy thought process i went to my closest friend n, completely forgetting q as q and g don't know each other that well. i hope q will forgive me for not keeping his secret, and not telling him i was going to tell n and confront g first.
-----:26
"old dog learns new trick"
after looking through some comments i realize this is not a joke. now i've seen a lot of shit in my 25 years, but i've never seen a dog show. after about 100 viruses and popups on my phone, i see a play button over a black box.
-----:27
it is important to note that my sophomore year, i liked to make those beatboxing sounds like scratches and what not, but this one in particular, i would just but my finger over the middle of my lips like i was shushing somebody, and just sucked air in.
-----:28
.i want you to picture a 5'7 140lb 18 year old white kid and a 6 foot tall 110lb obnoxiously dressed hooker jumping out of an older style black mercedes and running down a main road. .after what seemed like at least 5 mins of running in circles i got her to stop so i could call a friend for money. .the hooker and i are standing 20 feet from each other just waiting for my friend to pull up with 40 dollars so i could get my moms keys back and i could go home.
-----:29
helpdesk/network admin stuff as well as work in sales (its a private company). well, my sister died 7 years ago, and i'm a pretty chill guy so i don't like to bring it up and be the debby downer so i usually do a little white lie. he brings back up, "so what do your sisters do" well i say my little sister is going to school in *insert legal pot state here*.
-----:30
either way, we always have a full filter pitcher of ice-cold water in the fridge. i always wake up before my dad, and i'm always thirsty, so once i popped out of bed, i headed to the kitchen for a drink of water. i pulled the door of the fridge open, grabbed the pitcher, and prepared to pour a glass of water...when i noticed something **very** off.

-----:31
.being from california, i hadn't had a lot of interaction with cold weather and snow- meaning sometimes you have to pee really bad when you are in a really warm room and walk outside to a cold snowy area.
 the next day the class met at school, jumped in a big long yellow bus and we traveled up to the cabins in the mountains.
-----:32
i get down and this dude working is like “dudee, try this super pill, works every time” .. i hear that they test the temperature of your pee so i need to make sure her bottle of piss stays hot from the time she pees into the bottle until the time i get to the place and into pee for myself. i hear that they test the temperature of your pee so i need to make sure her bottle of piss stays hot from the time she pees into the bottle until the time i get to the place and into pee for myself.
-----:33
.anyway, i was told to drill holes into some .44 mag.([patent pending brass poker](http://i.imgur.com/1nnmvan.jpg)).
 then i saw the broke [drill bit](http://imgur.com/ofk0gp1.jpg).
-----:34
.before i go on i should say that i have this habit of whenever i get home in my room i always throw my wallet in the air and see if i can make it land directly this small tray on my dresser. lol, so i came home and tossed the bag of gummies and my phone onto my bed and tossed my wallet at the tray. *i tossed my wallet on bed and chucked my gummy bears and phone at my tray.* i was tired that after seeing myself toss the wallet on the bed, my body still proceeded to do nothing because everyone else doesn't allow anything to sleep right now.
-----:35
i had forgotten that i had an ear wax dissolvent bottle that looked exactly the same shape and size of my eye drop bottle.
-----:36
.i've just recently learned that i had my high-beam switch perpetually forward, which means that every time, every instance i used my headlights, my high-beams would also turn on. .so for about...i would estimate, 2-months solid, i've been driving like a fuck-up.
-----:37
he told me to come outside of the room and then asked me how much did i drink and if i brought a crazy drunk girl over. i was like "yeah, i brought a girl over but she's okay, not crazy." .
 go to the kitchen and disgusted, clean her shit and piss from the floor.
-----:38
so this happened 3 days ago, but i didn't have time to write it until now.
 a little back story before we begin:
so it is that time of the year, and as a newly graduated high school student in the u.s., it was time to go to my college orientation. try to some how position my ding dong in a way that will allow me to pee in the cup, but i can't do it while the car is still moving.
-----:39
blushing red i call for my crew, stick my hand under my jacket and we run back to the helicopter to work out this mess. i pour a little lubricant on my hand to smoothen it up, but as so much time has already passed i smash it on the floor behind the pilots seat.
-----:40
.so one day i see her on the bus pushing a stroller with a baby in it (when did she have a baby?) and with the most emphatic smile i can muster up i look her right in the eyes and give her the warmest "hello, how are you doing?". stunned, i just kind of take my seat and feel like i was just punched in the face. a couple of weeks later i get my opportunity, i see her getting on the bus that goes from downtown to our neighbourhood. i got that feeling but i thought i began to doubt myself because of the evil doppelganger.
-----:41
i just thought to myself she probably lived close to her job so she always got home before me (yea i know dumb assumption this should have been a red flag already).
 so far so good, i'm really getting along with her and she asks me if i want to play a truth or dare game with her.
-----:42
tifu because i had the hubris to believe that my trusty flash drive i keep on me every second of every day would never jump ship. i’m a senior in a design college about to graduate in a few months, and i’m currently in my portfolio class where we are meant to composite all our design work and make ourselves marketable. .woke up the next day and saw my flash drive wasn’t in my purse, wasn’t in my second purse, wasn’t in my backpack, my car, you name it.
-----:43
let me just preface by saying that one of my irrational fears is that i will forget to the lock the bathroom door at work, and someone will open it on me mid-stream (i'm a male). story time:
i was walking around the halls while the students were in class, and i decided to stop at the faculty restroom on my way back to my classroom.
-----:44
(while in highschool) one day in drafting class me and my best friend were talking about the girl and i was mentioning how she was beautiful kind etc. we keep talking and suddenly this muscular baseball player starts talking louder so we hear announcing we are talking about his girlfriend.
-----:45
when i was younger, my dad would get her a coffee gift card and some cups, and occasionally a coffee-maker on her birthday/mother's day. .the staples and nails holding in the new carpet come undone and i go flying backwards down the stairs with my friend, and tumbling into the doorway with that burnt liquid from hell falling on friend and i. my parents would've screamed or tried to help, but they were too baffled as to why i was holding a giant coffee cup that looked like whoever owned it would be compensating for something in a big way.

-----:46
the nozzle was sitting on the shelf next to the mostly emptied container - fuckfuckfuck - surrounded by a sticky puddle of half-crystallized weed killer. i figured out that the tube had still been full when i put it away - the container acted as a siphon, emptying itself out.
-----:47
arrived at the airport, they were stunned we forgot, then directed us to a small booth in the back of the airport to print our boarding pass. first they demanded we pay $100 per person to print our boarding passes.
-----:48
i cried and slept downstairs until they died
-----:49
i was sort of taken aback by the fact that she didn't get my pop culture reference, so i told her to google tonya harding.
 then it hits me - tonya harding didn't only bash nancy kerrigan's knee (the reference i was talking about), she also made a terrible amateur porn vid that i had forgotten about 15 years ago.
-----:50
now, just outside the main doors was a sign saying "visitors must wear plastic bags on their feet." with 2 boxes underneath, one containing a bunch of rubber bands and the other containing blue plastic bags. "the sign totally said to wear the bags underthat, you're golden" i kept saying to myself as the interview progressed.
 the construction workers are allowed to use this building's facilities as long as they wear plastic bags on their feet.

-----:51
i was getting really discouraged with the relationship, and one night after a particularly bad fight, i got really drunk and sexted a girl i had been talking to/flirting with about a year ago via the app kik. she had tried to set me a later alarm, but since she's blind as a bat without glasses/contacts, she had accidentally opened up the kik app and came across the messages i had sent to that girl a month ago.
-----:52
meanwhile, my grandma had her birthday the next day and because she lives in the other city, i thought it would be nice to buy her flowers and take a bus a day earlier, so we could spend more time together.
 the bus to the other city was leaving in about an hour, so i decided to go home really quick, change my clothes and then buy the flowers.
-----:53
sooooo, i get the bright idea to cover a finger in lube and shove that fucker right on up my ass.

-----:54
(that's a whole other story, but the short of it is i can't stand it when i'm in a group and no one is talking to me.) so, kay has been encouraging me and trying to help me sort it all out. one of our regular attendees (another guy) typically likes to give side hugs to all the girls as they leave. so, kay gets ready to leave, she is standing at the top of the stairs talking to someone.
-----:55
whenever i fall asleep and smell my bed sheets, go to a concert, or simply do my everyday routine, i get turned on whenever i psychologically think that a certain item smells like pussy (or may potentially smell like it). however, that day was also a long day so i crashed in the bed, but with her panties around my head and the cloth wrapped around my nose.
-----:56
.fast forward to today and still i haven't left my hotel room for more than 20 minutes at a time since i got sick. so get into the water and start swimming out as fast as i can. i look down into the water and see there's four fucking scuba divers about 2 meters below me, completely grossed out, pointing at my cloud of diarrhea to warn each other and swimming away as fast as they could.
-----:57
meanwhile i am trying to hold my laugh in this old lady, easely in her 75-80 years rolls up to me in a wheelchair and wants to ask me something, i look up at her and rip one of my in-ear headphones out, letting the other one stay in.
-----:58
all i could say was “h-hey mom i still need that book!” usually my mother actually does what i say when i’m upset like that, and i think she would’ve gave me the book back, but oprah already reached for it, and sure enough the dirty pics were exposed.

-----:59
i was thinking about how hot the weather was and how pointless it was to sweat in the minibus when i noticed two incredibly beautiful girls in horizon, walking on the sidewalk next to us. i was thinking about how hot the weather was and how pointless it was to sweat in the minibus when i noticed two incredibly beautiful girls in horizon, walking on the sidewalk next to us. i held by the steel rod of the automatic door and leaned towards outside, looking directly at the girls.
-----:60
as i approach the parking lot i see a white car resembling that of my friend's with its headlights on, so i think to myself, *oh she must have been waiting for a couple minutes now, better hurry it up.* i quicken my pace and make it to the passenger door of the car. i look up slightly and the driver who's also female looks up at me and asks, "*tim?"* i was caught off guard and just muttered "oh shit, i'm sorry, wrong car...." i quickly slam the door and turn around trying to find my friend's car nearby.
-----:61
seeing an unopened bottle of fizzy water, i thought i may as well use it to make the kool-aid - it would save me using a bowl or a pitcher to make the drink, and i'd never tried kool-aid fizzy, so i thought it was worth a try.
 i frantically ran to get some kitchen roll and bleach (to clean the surfaces, i didn't want to drink _quite_ yet) and spent literally the next two hours cleaning the bright red food dye which, by this point, had managed to spread out across the entire kitchen.

-----:62
sitting on a duct, finishing removal when a piece of insulation got wrapped around a valve without me knowing.
 i had thought i broke the pipe and found my boss who was able to help me locate it and shut it off.
-----:63
i go into the bathroom to see that he has squeezed white paste out of the anti fungal cream tube, and our colgate is still sitting on the tub.
-----:64
luckily the kid on the controller must have felt my awkwardness because he exited the camera screen after a couple seconds and kept playing like nothing happened.
-----:65
it was quite a nice morning, but after eating the bun i felt i there were dozens of the poppy seeds stuck between my teeth and i didn't have much time left to brush my teeth again so i threw a piece of gum into my mouth and went out.
-----:66
like the one i find out that she's highly bisexual and has had flings with her friends back in high school. after that night, i listen to her talking to one of her high school friends that is going to college in the next state over. after a few phone calls, she tells me that she wants me to take her to a city between our college and her friend's college and rent a hotel room for a weekend.
 so i do, and it happens to be the city where my best friend and his girlfriend are from, so we ride back with them and go to the hotel.
-----:67
instead of just popping the corner of [the container](http://elingreso.com/wp-content/uploads/mint_in_plastic_container_from_chinese_restaurant.jpg), or pouring it into a bowl, or any other number of ways to reheat chinese food, i thought i'd poke a hole in the top to vent the steam. i keep going, thinking i'd be able to stop the knife from going through the second half of the plastic.
-----:68
he stayed away from frat parties and might roll his eyes at an especially vulgar or dumb joke, but he was really nice to everyone and always up for an intelligent or witty joke. he stayed away from frat parties and might roll his eyes at an especially vulgar or dumb joke, but he was really nice to everyone and always up for an intelligent or witty joke. he stayed away from frat parties and might roll his eyes at an especially vulgar or dumb joke, but he was really nice to everyone and always up for an intelligent or witty joke.
-----:69
so, there we are getting through security, and because we had business-class tickets we went in a very quick line('cause that's one of the plusses with business clas) and we are amazingly quickly at the end of security and my handbag is the last one through.
-----:70
i opened his gallery to find pictures and videos of him with other women, now i knew he had had a decent amount of ex girlfriends and hadn't deleted anything on his phone recently but being a stereotypical woman i overreacted and decided to go through his messages to see who those women were and what they meant to him only to find that during the first 3 months of our relationship he had been avidly flirting with multiple women and even going so far as to ask one of them for pictures of her breasts.
-----:71
so i think to myself, "what are the chances of being in this w/o a single person i know." so i take the class hoping to get better physically and feel a bit better about myself. the only reason i'm planning on staying in this class is: raise my fitness level & maybe if i'm dropped in the worst situation for my social phobia maybe it would go away. if my social fear becomes unbearable i'm planning on just shelling out 50bucks to get the hell out.
-----:72
so i mount my camera with the lens to a tripod out on my driveway, i figure i'm going to be out there a while so i should pull up a chair.
-----:73
we're high school age teens, we're bored, there's a walmart in the same shopping center across the parking lot.
 8:30 - myself and two friends we'll call kevin and sylar have just finished eating at a chinese buffet. we're high school age teens, we're bored, there's a walmart in the same shopping center across the parking lot.

-----:74
in order to park in the lot, you have to be a resident of the complex and have a parking placard, if you don't you either need to park in the visitor designated parking area, or on the street. the one day, i went to work, and did some errands, how ever i took down the placard hanging from my rear view mirror so i could drive without it distracting me, and put it on the little shelf above my glove compartment. i got home after running errands, parked in the lot, and thought i put the placard back up.
-----:75
those reverberations i was feeling was my fart vibrating off this poor girl's bare belly while she spooned me. whazzit?" as her half asleep mind tried to process what just happened and why she was so abrubtly woken up.
-----:76
rain storm came in the afternoon with wind gusts, and the whole fucking thing came crashing down right onto my wife's car straight through the windshield.

-----:77
when i heard this i wasn't too concerned seeing as most bathrooms are somewhat small and have the toilet near the door so i figured i could just push the door closed if anyone tried to enter (and lets face it, incredibly a bunch of elementary school boys are going to think it's hilarious to barge in on someone using the bathroom, and i saw it happen to someone else with my own eyes within the first hour of settling in).
-----:78
anyway, he says to me "hey bro, let us get drinks on you, and we'll pay cash for your beer." obviously, i understood that he was trying to work out a deal to hop in line, however his phrasing matched with the fact that i'm not very trusting of seemingly shady assholes put me in a bit of a skeptic vibe.
 so now we're at the front, and as they begin ordering drinks, i start to rack my brain over what is gonna take place.
-----:79
well today she shows up at my door and hands me an envelope and says "its no big deal but i dont want your mom to worry this christmas" she tells me to give it to my mom and leaves.

-----:80
i asked what he meant by "let me go." we were slow so i figured i could just leave early. he then said that i could go home early if i wanted but i just decided to work my last 30 minutes. i'm going to see if they can give me a second chance tomorrow because i really felt like i was doing a way better job than they thought i was.
-----:81
while doing this i actually start working on something important for my boss, so i start to ignore my friend.
-----:82
every other door is locked, and eventually i end up standing outside the building in my boxers. .they find my friend, knock on the door - mid-sex, for them - and he comes to the lobby, tells me i'm a massive dumbass, and gets me back into his room.
-----:83
well it changes quickly into a past sex life of theirs, now that should have been the point in time where i just noped the fuck on out of there, but i didn't.
-----:84
as i swing my arm out to start building momentum, she sits straight up on me. my arm moves around and i start the slight whip-like motion so that it i get a nice "pop" as my hand lands.
 after what felt like a lifetime, i was able to allow her to get off (not the way i had hoped).
-----:85
it turned into an all out sprint and i just couldn't run fast enough.
-----:86
it wasn't long before me and my pre-pubescent cronies skated our douchey asses straight to safeway (where we would always hang out anyways, for some reason) to get our hands on this irresistible new elixir. now jenna was a true champion in this moment, because just as i was walking up, she was in the process of proving that she could drink an entire bottle of mint extract in one shot without even wincing.
-----:87
so i trekked down to the shop to get cash out, and ended up talking to the cashier for about 40 minutes about his whole life story. i'd seen him around, spoken to him before, and we also had mutual friends, so i assumed he was a chill guy. i eventually messaged him later to say that his behaviour wasn't cool, and he said that i should've locked the door on the way out, and that he apologises for his nocturnal reflexes and that next time i can sit on the floor.
-----:88
we tried to see them twice last year and it didn't work out each time. he got stuck in really bad traffic and had no idea how long he'd take so i waited outside all the way through the concert. with retail being busy this time of year, i just didn't even double check the dates of the show. i even got special permission to leave work early to see the concert.
-----:89
so i pause the game and it shows the virus strain, what it looks like in the apes and humans, daily infections and deaths, and *oh god* the name big in the top left corner. i was gonna tell him it's not what it looks like but he starts walking away and says i really need to turn that off. without hesitation i delete the games progress, rename the virus to simian flu, and didn't make eye contact with the teacher for a week along with drawing attention to me.
-----:90
i'm straining, i'm shimmying, i'm squeezing and pushing, all trying to get my little turd-baby moving. that's right, i'm digging in my own bung-hole to remove poop piece-by-bloody-mucus-covered-piece.
-----:91
instead of us all doing a specific activity in our groups (we all do basketball or dodgeball or something) they instead decided to have us all do whatever we wanted out of a selection of things.

-----:92
i woke up late for class because my alarm was set to 9 pm not am (i just got a new phone, sue me).
 i hadn't even watched that scene yet so i didn't know what was about to come. get your dick wet.*" i shut my computer immediately and it still wouldn't stop! and the voice continued in the same tone even though my laptop was shut. i threw it in my bag but you could still hear it for another 20 seconds untill my computer realized i shut it.

-----:93
on the way to the woods was a small pond with benches which we'd often sit at post-smokening to enjoy our high. we did this for a minute until one of the pebbles actually landed on a duck's butt & bounced off; prompting a tail shake & quick indifference on the duck's part. "oh fuck", leon covered his mouth with his hands, devastated by the rocky horror he'd personally unleashed on innocent duck honking, sending it to a premature, watery grave.

-----:94
a few minutes go by and one of my best friends shows up, so i send him a message saying i (the imaginary sender) am an admirer of his on facebook and would like to see more. however my wife and i thought it would be funny to keep this going for a bit and started teasing him about having a foreign (all the messages showed up as different area codes from different countries) sugar momma, and never got around to driving home the "got ya!" punchline.

these are the types of tests that they give you 30 minutes to do, all multiple choice (like 10 simple questions) and you can finish in 5 minutes tops. besides handing us out a test booklet and a pencil, we got a periodic table handout (have no fucking idea why we would need this, this is bio not chem). so, being bored even of my beautiful symmetrical lines, began to write down the lyrics to the song. we talk about how planting a billion trees is a stupid idea and isn't a long term solution to the rising co2 levels (trees are still cool though).

a minute later i’m walking toward my class and my hands get cold, so i put my hands in my pockets and start to feel around and realize that something in my pocket is rather slimy, then the smell goes from pigs to ranch dressing. when i get in there i empty my pockets of my ranch coated flash drives and get my jacket off (which incidentally has a small hole in the pocket that i was aware of but didn’t really care about.) i look down and there is a bunch of globs of ranch running down the middle of my shirt.

.one day my two buddies and i went to go hangout with a couple of girls. my two buddies and i were waiting far enough away from the bathroom for our friends to finish showering. .after i moved away from the door my one buddy took his turn listening. "get the fuck away from my daughters you fucking pedophile!" "im calling the police on you!" you'll be fucking arrested and raped in jail." i shit you not, the father said every single word quoted here to my buddy.

i get the hot chocolate and go about my day, feeling worse and worse as the day went on. i begin to say "my teacher told me to come call my parents to pick me up because i do not feel good." it was at this point, the principle walked out of her office and was standing in front of me.
