the u.s . 
 environmental protection agency ( epa ) issued a final rule in 2005 to reduce 
 atmospheric concentrations of sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) . 
 this final rule , 
 which took effect on january 31 , 2009 , 
 requires a 75 percent reduction in so2 emissions from 2005 levels 
 by 2030 . 
 this reduction is required to protect public health and

 is insufficient to reduce so2 because it does not include other pollutants 
 such as nitrogen oxide . 
 this paper reviews the arguments in favor and 
 against the 75 percent reduction .
