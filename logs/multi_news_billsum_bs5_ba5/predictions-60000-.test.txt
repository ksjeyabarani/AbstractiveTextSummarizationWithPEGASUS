– If you eat meat, you may want to make sure you're eating it safely. That's the message behind a new federal law that requires meat producers to test their products for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the Christian Science Monitor reports. The law, which went into effect last week, also mandates that eggs must be tested for the presence of Campylobacter and salmonella, which are both "critically important" antibiotics, according to the World Health Organization. The Center for Science in the Public Interest calls the law "harsh" and "probably the most important piece of food safety legislation ever passed by Congress," the Monitor reports. The Center for Science in the Public Interest says the law could save lives by reducing the need for antibiotics in food, which are now used to treat an estimated 50 million people each year, according to the New York Times. The law's supporters say it could also help stop the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in meat and eggs. But critics say the law could actually make people sick by making people less likely to wash their hands and sanitize their equipment, the Times reports. The law's supporters say it could also help stop the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by reducing the need for antibiotics, which are now used to treat an estimated

– President Trump's proposed budget for 2018 includes a record $516 billion for the Pentagon, a record for the Department of Veterans Affairs, and a record for the NIH. But that doesn't mean it's going to be an easy sell on Capitol Hill. Under a law passed in 1993, the president can propose spending cuts to the defense budget on the same day the House and Senate send his budget to him, the New York Times reports. The law states that "no special message may be considered in accordance with this section if the special message proposes to rescind more than one item of budget authority." The GOP-controlled House has already passed a bill to undo Trump's proposed cuts, but it's not clear whether the Senate will follow suit, the Washington Post reports. Trump's proposed budget doesn't include any cuts to domestic programs, the NIH, or Meals on Wheels, among other things. It also doesn't include money for Trump's wall on the US-Mexico border, despite the fact that Congress has already passed a bill to build it. Trump's proposed budget also includes cuts to Meals on Wheels, Head Start, and other programs that help low-income families. But it doesn't include funding for Trump's wall on

– It's not the kind of health care plan you'd expect to see on cable news, but that's exactly what Fox News is airing. The network is defending itself against a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of more than 30 million members that claims it violated the Affordable Care Act by driving up costs for members, the Los Angeles Times reports. The suit claims Fox—which is owned by News Corp.—violated a provision of the law that prohibits health insurers from denying coverage because of a member's pre-existing conditions. According to the suit, Fox—which is also owned by Time Warner and CBS—pressured members into paying higher premiums to keep costs down as part of a strategy known as "managed care," which involves paying doctors more to treat members instead of keeping costs down for the rest of the company. The network says it's standing by its decision to keep members with pre-existing conditions, which is why the suit is so unusual, the New York Times reports. "This is a health care company, not a cable news network," a lawyer for the plaintiffs says. "This is a health care plan, not a cable news network." Fox says it's standing by its decision to keep members with pre-existing conditions

– The EPA has issued new rules designed to curb the release of greenhouse gases from cars and light trucks, and the industry is not happy. The rules, which go into effect in March, will require automakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions by a third by 2030, reports the Wall Street Journal. The big difference between the old and new rules is that the old rule requires automakers to report their emissions, while the new one requires them to do so, reports Bloomberg. The EPA says the old rule was too broad, and the new one is more specific, but industry groups say it's a step in the right direction. “The EPA’s new rule is an important step forward in reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” says the president of the National Association of Manufacturers.

– The US National Academy of Space is set to open its doors in 2018, and it's not looking to recruit new astronauts right now. Instead, it's looking to attract the next generation of space buffs, NBC News reports. "We're looking for people who are passionate about space, people who are willing to go to space, people who are willing to work in space," the academy's director says. "We're not looking to get new astronauts. We're looking to get people who are willing to work in space for the rest of their lives." The idea is that people who go to the academy will be prepared to work in space, either as astronauts or as engineers in the space industry, NBC notes. The National Academy of Space was authorized in the 1990s by Congress to prepare people for "service in a space-related capacity in the United States or a United States corporation," according to its website.

– The Obama administration has a new plan to boost US exports, but it's not going over well with the small-business community. The White House is asking Congress to eliminate a host of tax credits that help small companies sell their products abroad, the New York Times reports. The move is part of a broader effort to cut red tape and make it easier for small businesses to sell their products to foreign markets. "We're going to get rid of all the tax credits that help small businesses sell their products overseas," says Rep. Peter King, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. "We're going to get rid of all the tax credits that help big businesses sell their products overseas." The move is likely to anger small-business owners who say the White House is over-regulating and over-taxing them, the Times notes.

– About 6 million Medicare and Medicaid dual eligibles—those who receive both benefits at the same time—will soon have a harder time getting their hands on the drugs they need, the Wall Street Journal reports. That's because, under a new law set to go into effect Jan. 1, insurers will be required to cover the drugs for these people for six months instead of the standard six months. The move is designed to make it easier for these people to switch plans, but critics say it will make it harder for them to find the drugs they need and could lead to health problems down the road. "It's a horrible injustice," says Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who's co-sponsored the bill. "It's going to make a lot of people suffer." The law will require insurers to cover the drugs for these people even if they're covered under both Medicare and Medicaid at the same time, the Washington Post reports.

– If you're over the age of 65 and have hearing loss, you may be eligible for Social Security benefits. But if you don't, you may not be able to afford hearing aids at all. That's according to a new rule that went into effect last week, the Washington Post reports. It's part of a larger effort by the Social Security Administration to make it easier for people who've had hearing loss to receive benefits. The rule, which applies to anyone who has had hearing loss for at least three years and has had a "comprehensive audiologic assessment," requires that anyone who applies for benefits get a hearing aid assessment, as well as counseling to determine whether it's appropriate for them and how they'll use them. The move is designed to make it easier for people who can't afford hearing aids to do so, as well as to make sure that those who do get them don't end up paying for them out of their own pocket, CBS News reports.

– A police officer in St. Louis, Mo., was shot and killed in the line of duty last year—and the officer's widow is suing the city, the county, the police department, and the two officers who fired the fatal shot, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, the widow, identified as 48-year-old Stacey Dash, says the officers violated her and her husband's civil rights when they used excessive force against her husband, 28-year-old Eric Garner, and then failed to follow proper protocol in de-escalating a tense situation. Dash was shot in the back of the head as she was walking back to her car from a convenience store with her 2-year-old son, who was also in the car, the Post-Dispatch notes. Dash's lawsuit, which accuses the officers of violating her and her husband's rights to due process and equal protection under the law, notes that she's suing not just the city, but the county, the police department, and the two officers who fired the fatal shot. The lawsuit also accuses the officers of violating Garner's constitutional rights to due process and equal protection by using excessive force, the Post-Dispatch

– It's been more than 50 years since the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and the US government still hasn't figured out how to keep it out of the hands of a madman. That's the conclusion of a new report from the Government Accountability Office, which looked at security at the nation's 50 sensitive nuclear facilities and found that the government has done a lousy job of keeping them safe, reports the Washington Post. Specifically, the government hasn't figured out how to make spent fuel storage areas more secure, how to beef up security at sites with "critical control systems," or how to increase security at sites with "site security, internal, site security, and fire protection." The report also found that the government doesn't do enough to make sure that terrorists aren't able to sneak a bomb into one of the sites, and it calls for better training for workers at nuclear facilities. The GAO report is out today, and it's not clear whether it will result in major changes to security at the sites, notes the New York Times.

– The Supreme Court today struck down a key part of President Obama's health care reform, ruling that the "trigger" in the law's individual mandate is unconstitutional, reports the New York Times. The lower court had ruled that the mandate to buy health insurance or pay a fine violated the Constitution's "separation of powers" between the federal government and states. The justices, however, didn't rule on the constitutionality of the rest of the law, meaning that the mandate will stand. In their decision, the justices said the lower court had "abused its discretion" by allowing the mandate to take effect without congressional approval, reports AP. The full court will rule on the matter in a few weeks.

– The Obama administration is readying a big push to bring high-speed Internet to rural America. The Department of Agriculture will today announce a series of loans and grants worth up to $200 million to help bring broadband to as many as 5 million Americans who live in rural areas, the New York Times reports. The money is being doled out as part of the Rural Broadband Enhancement Act of 2010, which was signed into law last year by President Obama. The program is intended to bring down the cost of broadband from the current $350 million a year to $150 million by 2020. The grants will go to projects that provide access to up to 10 megabits per second (Mbps) or more. The program will be led by the USDA's Rural Utilities Service, with help from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Washington Post reports. "This is a critical moment in our nation's history to make sure that every household has access to high-speed Internet," said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement.

– When the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed a new rule last month to regulate the auto industry, it didn't get the green light from Congress, the New York Times reports. That's because the 1996Significant Regulation Oversight Act—which Congress passed to "ensure that before a significant rule takes affect, the agency is given an adequate opportunity to review the rule and ensure that it is in accordance with the intent of Congress"—doesn't require that a rule be approved by Congress before it takes effect. The rule that's now being challenged, however, would require automakers to submit a cost-benefit analysis to show how new regulations would affect their bottom lines, the Times notes. The rule would also require auto makers to submit that analysis to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration if they want their products to be covered by OSHA's new safety regulations, which go into effect Jan. 1. The rule is being challenged because, as the Times notes, it's being challenged as an "arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of power," and because, as OSHA states in its complaint to Congress, "the proposed significant rule would have an adverse effect on an industry that employs millions of Americans." The rule is being challenged because, as OSHA

– If you're in the market for a new car, you may want to consider contributing to a college savings plan. The Wall Street Journal reports on a new IRS rule that allows people to sock away up to $1 million per year on a college savings plan—tax-free, of course. The rule, which took effect last month, is part of a larger effort by the IRS to make it easier for middle-class families to save for college, and it allows people to sock away up to $5 million per year on a variety of college savings plans. The rule is based on Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, which states that "a qualified state tuition program shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle," and it applies to accounts that are "established for the sole purpose of meeting the qualified higher education expenses of the designated beneficiary." For example, a family of four making $50,000 a year on a college savings plan would be able to sock away $1 million per year on a college savings plan, according to the Journal. "It’s a great way for middle-class families to invest in their children’s future," an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities tells the Journal.

– The Department of Transportation is cracking down on what it calls "unfair and deceptive practices" in the airline industry, the New York Times reports. Among other things, the new rules will require airlines to inform passengers when a flight has been delayed or canceled, and to give passengers a full refund if they request one within 48 hours of the delay. They also will require airlines to provide passengers with information about frequent-flyer programs. The rules are part of the Airline Passenger Fairness Act, which was passed by Congress in 1978 and requires the DOT to "prevent unfair and deceptive practices in the airline industry," according to the Wall Street Journal. The new rules are "long overdue," says an official with the Air Transport Association of America, which is pushing for the new rules. "The industry has been trying to get us to like them for a long time."

– If you work for Wendy's, McDonald's, or Taco Bell, you may be eligible for overtime if you work more than 40 hours in a week. But if you work fewer than 40 hours in a week, you may not be eligible for those overtime hours at all. That's according to a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of current and former employees of Wendy's, McDonald's, and Taco Bell in New York state, the New York Daily News reports. The suit alleges the companies violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National Labor Relations Act, as well as the Americans With Disabilities Act, by paying some employees less than the minimum wage and not paying overtime, the New York Times reports. According to the suit, the companies pay some employees as little as $3.33 per hour, which is less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. The National Labor Relations Board has been cracking down on companies that don't pay their workers enough, and Wendy's, McDonald's, and Taco Bell were named in the suit. The suit alleges the companies also violated the Americans With Disabilities Act by not providing employees with a reasonable opportunity to get injured or fired, the Times reports.

– The House today overwhelmingly passed a bill that would provide Israel with up to $100 billion in military aid from the US over the next decade, the AP reports. The measure, which gives Israel access to Patriot missiles, radar, and other equipment, was backed by both Republicans and Democrats. The White House has threatened to veto it, saying it would damage US-Israeli relations. The bill is expected to sail through the Senate, too, but it's not clear whether President Obama will sign it, the New York Times notes.

– In 1906, the US Congress passed the Copper Valley Native Act, which gave the Copper Valley Electric Association the rights to run a transmission line through parts of the American Indian territory of Alaska. Since then, the association has run the line at a cost of more than $1 billion, the Alaska Dispatch News reports. But the tribe's members say they were never consulted about the line's fate, and they're now suing the association for compensation, arguing that the US government has overstepped its bounds. The suit, which was filed in US District Court in Anchorage last week, accuses the association of "wrongful expropriation" of tribal land, as well as of violating the Native American Leasing Act, which was signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908 and gives Native Americans in the US the right to lease land for use in the electricity industry, the Dispatch News notes. The suit alleges that since the Copper Valley Electric Association was incorporated in 1957, it has acquired more than 2,000 acres of tribal land, as well as rights to run the line through those same acres, at a cost of more than $1 billion, the Alaska Dispatch News reports. The suit alleges that the association has also violated the Native American Leasing Act by failing to maintain proper records and by failing to pay proper

– The White House is kicking off a major initiative to boost teacher quality in America's schools, and it's using money from the federal government to do so. Under the Master Teacher Act of 2001, the Department of Education has the authority to award up to $100 million in grants to school districts across the country to boost the ranks of master teachers—teachers with at least five years of experience but who aren't guaranteed a job when they retire, the New York Times reports. The funds will be doled out over five years to help districts recruit, train, and retain master teachers, who will then be responsible for improving the instruction of other teachers in their schools, the Times notes. The idea is that master teachers will be better able to plan, implement, and monitor their own lessons, which will in turn improve the instruction of other teachers and, ultimately, student achievement, the Times notes. The program has been tested in several states, but the White House says it's the first time it's been tested in a large school district, the Times notes.

– President Obama has tasked the National Commission on the Advancement of Global Health with setting a goal of "the global eradication of disease" by the year 2050, and he's got a lot of work to do. The commission, which will be chaired by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, has just two months to submit its report to the president, who has the power to veto any report that doesn't meet his standards, the New York Times reports. The group's task is to come up with "a national strategy for coordinating governmental, academic, and public and private health care entities for the purpose of the global eradication of disease," according to the commission's website. It's not clear what that strategy will be, but Obama has said he wants to see the US lead the world in research, development, and production of technologies that will help fight disease, as well as in the production of medicines and " methodologies utilized to prevent and cure disease," the Times notes. The group will also be asked to make recommendations to the president on how to achieve this goal, and it's not clear how many recommendations it will have to make.

Rep. Spencer Bachus, the committee's top-ranking Republican, says he wants to know "what went wrong and how we can prevent it from happening again." Geithner and the other members of the panel will also be required to hand over any documents they have relating to the TARP plan.

– The US and Canada have agreed to create the world's largest wildlife refuge in the Arctic, the Guardian reports. The Northern Yukon-Arctic International Wildlife Refuge will cover 1.3 million square miles of Canadian territory and 3 million square miles of US territory. It will be the only refuge in the world that's completely off-limits to oil and gas development, according to the Guardian. The creation of the refuge is part of President Obama's plan to protect the planet from climate change, the Guardian reports. According to the AP, Obama signed a bill into law last month that will make the refuge part of the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Canadian government will pay for most of the construction and operation of the refuge. The US government will pay for most of the maintenance and operation of the refuge. The creation of the refuge is expected to save millions of dollars in oil and gas development costs, according to the Guardian.

– President Obama has signed a bill that offers veterans a tax credit for working in the renewable-energy industry, the New York Times reports. Obama signed the "Veterans in the Field of Renewable Energy Act" into law last night, and it's expected to help thousands of vets find work in the field. "Veterans have given their lives so that we can live in a world where our energy is generated by renewable sources," the president said in a statement. The bill offers a tax credit of up to 30% of the veteran's salary for up to a year, or up to $125,000 for a married couple, the Washington Post reports. It's not clear how many vets will actually be eligible for the credit, but the American Coalition for the Advancement of Energy's executive director says there are already "tens of thousands" of veterans working in the renewable-energy industry.

– The US Department of Defense is offering high school seniors the chance to give back to their schools with a free year of community service, the AP reports. Under the Defense Department's National Service for Schools program, students can apply for up to a year's worth of service at a military base, at a military-related nonprofit, or at a school that has a low-income student population. The program is open to any high school senior who has completed at least 2,000 hours of service and is not over the age of 35. "It's a great opportunity for students to give back to their school and to give back to the country that gave them so much," a defense official says. "It's also a great way for our troops to give back to the country that gave them so much." The program is open to any high school senior who has completed at least 2,000 hours of service and is not over the age of 35, according to the Defense Department's National Service for Schools website.

– The Justice Department has a new program in the works to help rural law enforcement, and it's not sitting well with some. The National Center for Rural Law Enforcement was established in 1997 under the Rural Law Enforcement Act of 1997—which notes that one-third of Americans live in nonurban areas, and 90% of all law enforcement agencies are in rural areas—but it's been "largely ignored," reports the Christian Science Monitor. The center, which will be located at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, will work with the FBI and the Justice Department to develop training and education programs for rural law enforcement, as well as help state and local law enforcement agencies boost their own capabilities, reports the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The center's executive director, who will be appointed by the attorney general, says it will focus on helping small and mid-sized law enforcement agencies, which are struggling to compete in the modern world. "We're going to try to help them get back on their feet," he says. "We're going to try to do everything we can to make sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs properly." The center will have 15 members on its advisory board, including 10 from law enforcement and one from the FBI.

– The feds have a new program to help low- and moderate-income kids get vaccinated, and it's drawing lots of attention. The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, orIDEA, was signed into law last month by President Obama, the New York Times reports, and it allows kids who aren't up to date on their vaccinations to get free or discounted shots. The program covers kids who are too young to be vaccinated at the time of their birth, but who live or attend school in areas with a high rate of unvaccinated kids, or who have a disability that makes it impossible for them to get the shots in time. The program covers kids who are too young to be vaccinated at the time of their birth, but who live or attend school in areas with a high rate of unvaccinated kids, or who have a disability that makes it impossible for them to get the shots in time.

The report calls for the Pentagon to "pursue alternatives to privatization and outsourcing," including "strategic sourcing" to find its "most efficient organization to perform commercial or industrial type functions."

– When it comes to the Internal Revenue Code, it's pretty straightforward: " DIVIDENDS OF INDIVIDUALS TAXED AT CAPITAL GAIN RATES," reads section 1(h) of the code. But that doesn't mean it's easy for investors to figure out how to take advantage of that section. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at what's involved, and it finds that many investors have a hard time figuring out how to take advantage of the section. One key part of the process is figuring out how much of a capital gains tax rate they'll actually have to pay. For example, if you're an individual who's not a resident of the US, you don't have to pay the capital gains tax on your dividends. But if you're an individual who's traded in a lot of stocks, you have to pay the capital gains tax on those gains, too. The problem is that the section doesn't spell out exactly what the tax rate should be for certain types of investments, and it's hard for investors to figure out what to do with all the different types of stock they're trading in, the Journal notes. As an example of how complicated the process is

– If you're a doctor who makes a ton of money off Medicare, you may want to stop reading now. The government is in the process of changing the way it calculates a doctor's "relative value"—a measure of a doctor's worth based on his or her charges to insurers—to make it more reflective of the cost of care, the Wall Street Journal reports. The move is part of the Medicare Physician Act of 2013, but it's not expected to take effect until the end of the year. The government will set up an expert panel to review the changes and report back to the Department of Health and Human Services, which will then make the final determination. The move is expected to save the government an estimated $115 billion over the next decade.

The White House yesterday announced that it is creating a National Public Health Coordinating Council, which will make recommendations to the president on how to make the Affordable Care Act work, the New York Times reports. The council will be made up of the heads of every federal department or agency, as well as the surgeon general, the head of each institute within the Department of Health and Human Services, and public health experts, reports the Washington Post. The council will be chaired by the secretary of health and human services, who will also serve as the co-chairpersons of the House and Senate health committees, and the House and Senate health committees. The council's task will be to ensure that the Affordable Care Act "is as effective as possible to reduce health care costs and improve the public's health," Obama said in a statement.

– You've heard of tax credits for going green, but what about tax credits for going green on the other side of the country? That's the idea behind a new federal law that provides up to 30% of the cost of a building's energy-saving measures, the Christian Science Monitor reports. The law was signed into law by President Obama in 2009, and it gives tax credits of up to 35% of the cost of energy-saving measures on new or renovated commercial buildings, as long as those buildings are located in states where the cost of those measures is less than the cost of the building itself. But critics say the law doesn't account for the cost of other energy-saving measures, like solar panels, which can cost more than twice as much as the cost of the building itself, the New York Times reports. "The law is simply a way for the government to take money out of your pocket and give it back to you in the form of a tax credit," says Rep. Peter King, a New York Democrat who has introduced a bill to repeal the law and replace it with one that gives tax credits of up to 50% of the cost of energy-saving measures on new or renovated buildings.

– The US Army Corps of Engineers has given the go-ahead for a massive dredging project on the Mississippi River that could send millions of gallons of raw sewage into the Gulf of Mexico, the AP reports. The project, which is expected to cost up to $20 billion, is designed to remove storm water from the river and redirect it toward the Gulf, where it will be used for drinking water and for industrial purposes. The Army Corps of Engineers says the project is necessary to prevent environmental damage, but critics say it will send billions of gallons of raw sewage into the Gulf and the Mississippi River—one of the most contaminated rivers in the country. "This is a classic case of the federal government overstepping its authority and putting private interests ahead of the public's interest," a lawyer for the Sierra Club tells the AP. "This is a classic example of the federal government being out-of-touch with the real world." The corps says the project is necessary to prevent catastrophic environmental damage, but critics say it will send billions of gallons of raw sewage into the Gulf and the Mississippi River—one of the most contaminated rivers in the country. The Army Corps of Engineers says it will work with the states of Mississippi, New Jersey, and Georgia to figure out a way to stop the

– Amtrak's Acela Express is set to become the country's first freight train to run daily between Boston and Washington, DC, starting in December. But the project—which the Washington Post reports will cost the federal government up to $5 billion—is more than just a train: It's a huge investment in the nation's infrastructure. The government has committed $15 billion to the project, with the rest coming from private investors. "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," says Sen. Chuck Schumer, who's been pushing for the train for years. The problem is that the federal government doesn't actually have the money to pay for it. The Post reports that Amtrak, which is owned by the Federal Railroad Administration, has used up most of its $5 billion in federal funds, and it's been forced to turn to private investors for the rest. The private sector has offered to buy up the rest of the debt, but Amtrak is balking, saying it needs more time to assess the situation. The project is expected to cost another $5 billion to finish, and it's not the only one in trouble. The New York Times reports that Amtrak's share of the cost of the St. Louis-to-Chicago freight

– The US military is spending more and more money on overseas bases—and allies aren't contributing as much as they used to, according to a new report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The report found that in 1992, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Japan each contributed more than 20% of the cost of US troops stationed abroad, while Japan paid 70%, the Washington Post reports. The US would have saved an estimated $5,000 million if other nations had paid at least 75% of the cost, according to the report, which was released as part of a defense spending bill that passed the House last week. Rep. Peter King, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, says the report shows that the US needs to negotiate more cost-sharing agreements with its allies, the New York Times reports. "It is in the national interest of the United States for the United States and our economically strong allies to enter into burden sharing support agreements that provide for such allies to defray most or all of the overseas basing costs for the United States forces stationed in the allied countries," he says.

– The Supreme Court today struck down a key part of the Citizens United ruling that opened the door to super PACs. The justices, ruling in a case brought by a group calling itself the Campaign Legal Center, said the provision in question, which allowed super PACs to coordinate with candidates, violated the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine, reports the New York Times. The ruling "sends a powerful message to corporate money in politics," says the center's executive director. "It’s a message that corporations can spend unlimited sums of money to influence elections, and it’s a message that super PACs can’t do the same." Under the ruling, super PACs that coordinate with candidates but don't have to disclose their donors are allowed to do so under certain conditions. For example, they can't coordinate with groups supporting or opposing a candidate, but can do so with one supporting or opposing that candidate. The case revolves around Section 527 of the Federal Election Act of 1971, which allows unlimited contributions to super PACs, notes the Washington Post.

– A bill that would end Israel's practice of detaining Palestinian children and trying them in Israeli military courts cleared its first major hurdle in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, the AP reports. The measure, which would end the practice of holding children under the age of 12 and prosecute them before a military court system that "lacks basic and fundamental guarantees of due process in violation of international standards," passed the House by a vote of 392-31. The Senate is expected to follow suit in a matter of days. The bill was introduced by Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and co-sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, according to the New York Times. Chaffetz says he was inspired to introduce the bill after hearing about the abuse of Palestinian children at the hands of Israeli security forces in the West Bank. Since 2000, an estimated 10,000 Palestinian children have been detained by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and prosecuted in the Israeli military court system. Children under the age of 12 cannot be prosecuted in Israeli military courts. Israeli military forces detain children under the age of 12 and question them, for several hours, before releasing them to their families or to Palestinian authorities. Human Rights Watch documented the abuse in a report

– New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed a bill that makes it legal for retired police officers to carry concealed weapons on government property, the New York Daily News reports. According to the New York Times, Cuomo signed the bill into law on Friday, making New York the 14th state to legalize concealed weapons for retired police officers. Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island have already legalized concealed weapons for retired police officers. The bill was hailed as a victory for gun-control advocates after it was signed into law by Cuomo on Friday. The bill allows retired police officers to carry concealed weapons on government property if they are "qualified current or former law enforcement officer" or if they have "appropriate written identification," the Daily News reports.

– New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed a bill that will make it easier for teachers to get tenure, the New York Daily News reports. The bill, which was signed into law Thursday, allows teachers to get tenure after three years of service in New York public schools. Until now, teachers could only get it after five years of service in New York public schools. According to the Wall Street Journal, teachers can get a three-year reprieve if they've been with the same school for at least three years. The bill also allows teachers to get tenure if they've been with the same school for at least five years. It's not clear how the bill will be paid for, but it's expected to cost the state around $1 million per year.

It's called Blue Cross and Blue Shield of California, and it's the only one of the bunch that doesn't require employees to have health insurance.

– It's been more than 40 years since Congress passed the Brownfields Housing and Community Development Act, which was meant to help communities clean up and redevelop abandoned buildings. The problem is that many of those properties are contaminated with toxic chemicals, and the EPA doesn't have the money or manpower to clean them up, reports the Los Angeles Times. So the Department of Housing and Urban Development has taken the unusual step of setting up its own grant program to help clean up such properties. The result: dozens of projects across the country, including the cleanup of dozens of Superfund sites in Los Angeles, New York, and Washington, DC, and the construction of thousands of new affordable housing units, reports the New York Times. "This is a first step," says a HUD official of the new program. "It's a small step, but it's a big step."

– If you've ever dreamed of being able to shout from the rooftops, well, you're going to have to get your wish granted. The FCC has approved a plan to allow people to use wireless microphones at stadiums, theme parks, and other venues where TV is shown, the Los Angeles Times reports. The plan, which still needs to be approved by the FCC's full board, will allow people to use the microphones at events where TV is shown, as long as they're within a safe range of the bands designated for that use. The move is designed to prevent interference from TV signals, but critics say it will allow people to shout for hours at a time and could lead to interference from other sources, like cell phones, reports the New York Times, which notes that the plan is just the latest attempt by the FCC to crack down on wireless microphone use. Last year, for example, the agency banned the use of wireless microphones at concerts.

– The Trump administration has made it easier for farmers to apply for federal programs that help them protect the environment, the New York Times reports. Under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, farmers can get up to 75% of the costs for certain conservation projects associated with their operations, up to 40% of those costs if they also make improvements in other areas, and up to 100% of their income if those improvements are deemed to be of "exceptional importance" to the environment. The program has been around since the 1980s, but the White House announced changes last week that will make it easier for farmers to apply and easier for the government to pay for them. For example, farmers no longer have to file a formal application with the USDA, but they can now apply online, and the government will pay for the work itself. The changes will also make it easier for states to set up their own EQIP programs, and the Times notes that the Trump administration has previously made it easier for farmers to apply for programs such as the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Conservation Reserve Program.

– President Obama has signed a bill that could spell the end for dozens of nuclear labs across the country, the New York Times reports. The Department of Energy is expected to close or sell off dozens of labs—some of them more than 100 years old—as part of the 2015 Energy Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act, which aims to boost research and development of clean energy technologies. The move is expected to save the department up to $5 billion a year, according to the Times, which notes that the closure or sale of dozens of labs could lead to the loss of thousands of jobs. The bill, which was signed into law by Obama on Tuesday, calls for the department to work more closely with the private sector to develop technologies like nuclear fusion and alternative energy sources, the Times reports. The bill calls for the department to work more closely with universities and other nonprofit institutions to develop new energy technologies, according to a press release from the White House. The bill also calls for the department to work more closely with the National Nuclear Security Administration to ensure the safety of nuclear weapons.

– The ex-wife of San Francisco 49ers tight end Vernon Davis is suing his current wife and the team for discriminating against her because she's a victim of domestic violence, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, claims Davis was denied health insurance because of her "history of domestic violence" and is suing for "wrongful termination" of her policy, as well as for "wrongful termination of her employment" and "wrongful termination of her pension," according to a press release from Davis' attorney. The suit also claims the 49ers discriminated against her by refusing to cover her for pre-existing conditions and refusing to pay for treatment she received after she was injured in a car accident, the Chronicle reports. Davis' current wife, however, is suing both the 49ers and Davis' current and former wives for "wrongful termination" of the couple's policy, as well as for "wrongful termination" of her own policy, according to the press release. Davis' attorney tells the Chronicle his client was denied insurance because she was a victim of domestic violence, which is against the law in San Francisco and in the US. But the 49ers deny that claim, saying in a statement to the Chronicle that "any

– It's been more than 30 years since Congress passed the Young and Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Act, designed to help first-time farmers get off the farm and into the work force. But as the Washington Post reports, the program has been "largely unused"—until this year, when President Trump signed an executive order making it easier for first-time farmers to start their own farms. The mandate of the Young and Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Act of 2018 allows farmers to buy up to 25% of their land from other farmers for up to 50% less than what they would have paid if they had kept the land outright, with the option to buy it back at a later date for up to 50% less. It also allows farmers to sell surplus farm equipment or property to "disadvantaged farmers or ranchers, veteran farmers or ranchers, or beginning farmers or ranchers," as well as to farmers and ranchers who are in their first or second generation on a farm. The program has been hailed as a big help to first-time farmers and ranchers, who make up the lion's share of the nation's farm sector, but it has also been criticized for being too expensive, and for not reaching many first-time farmers and ranchers, who may not be able to

According to a letter from the Army Corps of Engineers obtained by Mother Jones, construction on federal roads and highways can cause up to 10% more water to run off into streams and watersheds than is allowed by federal law. The letter demands that the Army Corps of Engineers and the US Forest Service work together to come up with ways to reduce water runoff from highway projects. The Forest Service, for its part, says it will work with state and local governments to come up with solutions. The Forest Service says it will also work with states to come up with best practices for reducing water runoff from highway projects. The letter was signed by Gen. John Kelly, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.

– The Department of Veterans Affairs is facing a lawsuit over its policy of transferring veterans to hospitals that don't treat them properly, the Los Angeles Times reports. According to CNN, the policy was put in place under the Department of Veterans Affairs' Emergency Treatment Act, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2011. The law requires hospitals to send veterans to hospitals that are "capable of providing appropriate emergency medical treatment" if the veteran's condition is "emergency" or "life-threatening," and to inform the veteran and his or her attorney of the risks and benefits of such a transfer. The ACLU filed the lawsuit against the Department of Veterans Affairs last week, claiming the policy is unconstitutional. "The Department of Veterans Affairs should not be transferring veterans to hospitals that are incapable of providing appropriate emergency medical treatment," the ACLU states in the lawsuit. The Washington Post reports the policy was put in place in response to a series of high-profile cases in which veterans were sent to hospitals that didn't treat them properly. In one high-profile case, an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran was sent to a hospital in St. Louis that didn't treat him properly after he went to the emergency room with a blood clot in his lung. The hospital refused to send the veteran to

– In the wake of the Connecticut school shooting, President Obama called for an "all-hands-on-deck" response to gun violence in America's schools. Now, the Department of Education is set to make its first round of grants under the 1994 Safe Schools Act to help keep America's schools safe, the New York Times reports. The grants will go to schools in areas with "high rates of homicides committed by persons between the ages 5 to 18, inclusive," as well as those with "serious school crime, violence, and discipline problems." The program is meant to help prevent such crimes in the first place. The grants will be awarded to "local educational agencies to carry out projects designed to achieve violence prevention," according to the department's website. The grants will go to programs that include "school safety committees, which include faculty, parents, staff, and other appropriate agencies," as well as initiatives designed to combat violence and discipline in schools, the Times notes. The program is just one component of Obama's plan to make America's schools free of drugs and violence by 2000.

– The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area in Louisiana has been added to the National Register of Historic Places, making it the first national heritage area in the continental US, reports the AP. The preserve covers an area stretching from the Mississippi River all the way to the Gulf of Mexico and includes sections of the Atchafalaya Basin—"an assemblage of rich and varied resources forming a unique aspect of the heritage of the United States," according to the National Park Service. The area's "historic resources form a cohesive and nationally distinctive landscape arising from patterns of human activity shaped by geography," says the National Park Service, which describes it as having "a complex mixture of people and their origins, traditions, customs, beliefs, and folkways of interest to the public." The preserve will be able to apply for federal funds to protect it from oil and gas development. The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area was established by the Louisiana Legislature in 2011, and the Preserve Atchafalaya National Heritage Area application will be considered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service next month, reports the Times-Picayune.

– Breast cancer is the No. 2 cause of cancer death in the US, with 40,000 American women dying of the disease each year, according to the American Cancer Society. So it should come as no surprise that the federal government is ramping up its environmental research on the disease, the New York Times reports. A 2001 law established the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences a Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Panel, which will make recommendations to the Department of Health and Human Services on which environmental factors are linked to breast cancer, and which research centers should be established. "There's a lot we don't know," says one of the panel's members. "We don't know what causes breast cancer, we don't know how to prevent it, we don't know what causes it, and we don't know how to treat it." Among other things, the panel will look at factors that increase a woman's risk of breast cancer, such as smoking, air pollution, and exposure to pesticides and other chemicals, the Times notes. The task force's recommendations will be acted on by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the National Institutes of Health, and the American Cancer Society.

– If you own a semi-truck, you may be able to get by with a little less help from the federal government. The Wall Street Journal reports that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act, which went into effect in 1994, requires semi-truck drivers to hold at least a two-year driver's license. But the law doesn't actually require them to hold that license, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration says it doesn't have the authority to do so because it's "not part of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's authority to regulate the motor carrier industry." That's because the FMCSA is a part of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation. The FMCSA says it has no jurisdiction over the FMCSA, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, because the FMCSA is a part of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.

– The Obama administration is rolling out a plan to make it easier for kids in low-income families to sign up for Medicaid, the New York Times reports. The Children's Health Insurance Program will make it easier for kids in families making less than three times the poverty level to sign up for the program, which subsidizes health care for an estimated 5 million kids. Families making up to four times the poverty level will be able to sign up for the program, and kids in families making up to eight times the poverty level will be able to sign up for it. The idea is to make it easier for kids in low-income families to get health care, and it's a move that's been met with mixed reaction. Critics say it will make it harder for kids in low-income families to get the care they need, and supporters of the plan say it will make it easier for kids in low-income families to sign up for Medicaid. But critics of the plan say it will make it harder for kids in low-income families to get the care they need, and they're calling for an independent audit of the program.

– If you're in the market for a new air-conditioning system, you'll soon be able to buy one that's been certified to save energy and money. The EPA is set to unveil a new rule today that will require manufacturers of air conditioning and heating equipment to have their products certified by a third-party organization before they can advertise them as being energy-efficient, the Wall Street Journal reports. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will also be given the authority to require manufacturers to submit energy-efficient products for testing. The rule is part of a push by the Obama administration to increase the number of energy-efficient products on the market, as well as to make it easier for consumers to choose the one that's right for them. The rule will require manufacturers to have their products certified by an independent third-party organization that is accredited under the International Electrotechnical Standardization Commission (ISO/IEC) Standard 17025, as well as by the US Department of Energy, which will have the authority to require the certification of products that don't meet the energy-efficiency standards of that organization, the Journal notes.

– The American Military Retirees Association is a nonprofit that was federally chartered in New York state in 1986 and has since grown to more than 20,000 members, the New York Times reports. But that doesn't mean it's free of controversy. In fact, the group's mission is to "protect earned benefits by educating on benefits available," according to its website. And that's exactly what it does, according to the Times. The group's mission is to "advocate for the protection of earned benefits through active monitoring of legislation in Congress and the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs." It also does things like educate veterans about their rights and help them apply for benefits, the paper notes. But it's not all good news. According to the Wall Street Journal, the American Military Retirees Association has been sued more than a dozen times for allegedly violating New York's open meetings law, failing to maintain proper records, and more. And it's not the only veterans' advocacy group that's been sued: The National Vietnam War Veterans Association has also been sued for allegedly violating New York's open meetings law, as well as for allegedly failing to maintain proper records.

– The Small Business Jobs Act of 2015 was signed into law by President Obama last week, and it gives small businesses a boost in the form of tax credits for hiring out-of-work Americans, the New York Times reports. According to the Wall Street Journal, the law gives businesses with fewer than 100 employees a $1,000 tax credit for each new hire. It also provides a $1,000 credit for each month that an employee is out of work. The law was signed by Obama at a White House event attended by small-business owners and supporters, the Times reports. "Small businesses are the heart of our economy," Obama said at the event. "They create the majority of the jobs in this country and they are the ones that pay the taxes that keep our economy growing." The small-business tax credit is meant to help small businesses compete in the modern economy, the Times reports. According to the Journal, the law will help small businesses that have had trouble finding workers because of the "erratic work schedules" of larger employers.

– The Obama administration is cracking down on for-profit hospitals that skirt a 1997 law banning them from receiving Medicare payments, the New York Times reports. The Health and Human Services Department says it's looking into whether Brigham and Women's Hospital in Provo, Utah, and Evergreen Health in Kirkland, Wash.—two of the nation's largest for-profit hospitals—violated the law by selling their assets to for-profit entities without first getting approval from the government. The law was passed as part of the Medicare Nonprofit Hospital Protection Act of 1997, according to the Washington Post. The Obama administration says it's concerned that for-profit hospitals are taking advantage of the law to avoid paying billions in Medicare costs. "The law is clear: If a for-profit hospital makes a transfer of assets or control to a for-profit hospital without first getting approval, the hospital is disqualified from receiving Medicare payments," a department spokeswoman tells the Times. Brigham and Women's Hospital, one of the country's largest not-for-profit hospitals, says it has complied with the law and will continue to do so. Evergreen Health, meanwhile, says it has complied with the law and will continue to treat patients.

The commission was established in the America's Youth Commission Act of 2001, which noted that "serious flaws have appeared in America's social and cultural fabric, characterized by destructive behaviors among some of our youth." Those flaws include high levels of alcohol and drug use, teen suicide and eating disorders, and violent acts like gun violence, the Times notes. The commission will look at "the nature, origins, and trends of antisocial and violent behavior among American youth," as well as "the influence of organizations, other cultural elements, and individuals contributing to violent behaviors," according to the commission's website.

– The US and Mexico have struck a trade deal that could have a big impact on air quality along the US-Mexico border, the Los Angeles Times reports. Under the deal, the US will allow cars from Mexico to come into the US without having to go through customs, and the Mexican government will allow those same cars to come into the US without having to go through customs. It's not clear how many cars will be allowed into the US under the deal, but it's expected to be a big boost to trade between the two countries, as well as to tourism and trade between the US and Mexico. The deal was announced by President Obama and Mexican President Enrique Pe ⁇ a Nieto at a joint press conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday. The deal is expected to boost trade between the US and Mexico by around $5 billion a year, the New York Times reports.

The union says it's concerned that the flag won't be seen by those who need to look at it, and it wants the flag to be displayed in a way that's respectful to the men and women who have served and are still serving in the Air Force. The union says it's also worried about the effect the flag will have on the morale of its members, who are mostly black. "The Air Force is a family," the union's president tells the Post.

– If you're an employee of the feds, you're entitled to an annuity. If you're an employee of the Social Security Administration, you're not. But if you're a member of the Thrift Savings Plan, which the feds set up to help Social Security recipients save for retirement, you are, and you can elect to receive an annuity from the government, the Wall Street Journal reports. The issue is that the Thrift Savings Plan is managed by the Social Security Administration, not the Social Security Administration itself. The feds say the annuity is meant to help participants save for their retirement, not receive money from the government. But critics say the feds are overstepping their bounds by allowing members of the Social Security Administration to receive money from the Thrift Savings Plan without socking it away in a 401(k) or other retirement account, the New York Times reports. "This is a abuse of the Thrift Savings Plan," says the executive director of the American Institute for Economic Research. "They're taking money from people who are supposed to be saving for retirement and giving it to people who are supposed to be saving for retirement."

– It's been more than a year since President Obama signed the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2015 into law, and it's time for Congress to "remove the competitive disadvantage to United States manufactures and consumers resulting from an outdated Harmonized Tariff Schedule and to promote the competitiveness of United States manufacturers," according to the bill. The Washington Post reports the bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on Sept. 16, with Rep. Peter King calling it "a common-sense piece of legislation that will help US manufacturers compete and strengthen our economy." The bill would suspend or reduce duties on imported goods that don't meet US availability or domestic availability requirements, according to the Wall Street Journal. It would also give the US International Trade Commission the power to reduce or suspend duties on goods from countries that have retaliated against US tariffs. "It is the sense of Congress that, to remove the competitive disadvantage to United States manufactures and consumers, Congress should consider a miscellaneous tariff bill not later than 180 days after the United States International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce issue reports on proposed duty suspensions and reductions under this Act," the bill states. It's not clear how long the bill would take to go through the House and Senate.

– The Cherokee Nation has been fighting for years to prevent child abuse on its reservations, and now the federal government has stepped in to help. The Department of Health and Human Services is directing $50 million to 31 tribes in 10 states to fight child abuse by providing diapers and other supplies to low-income families, reports the Washington Post. The move comes as part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to fight child abuse. The Cherokee Nation is one of nine tribes in the US that have been specifically designated as having high child abuse rates. The problem is especially pronounced on the reservations, where one in four children are victims of child abuse and one in five are victims of neglect, according to the Cherokee Nation's 2016 annual report on child abuse. The federal government says the new program will help fight child abuse by reducing the cost of diapers and other diapers for low-income families. But critics say it's another example of the Trump administration trying to do everything it can to help wealthy families at the expense of poor families. "The idea that the federal government is going to buy diapers for poor families is just plain wrong," Sen. John Thune of South Dakota tells the Post.

Among other things, it calls for the government to work more closely with state and local authorities to fight such threats, and to better coordinate efforts between the military and other federal agencies. It also lays out a series of goals to be met, including "achieving results and specific priorities." The Times notes that the document is the result of years of work by Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano, who was appointed by George W. Bush in 2004. It was last released in 2005.

– When the East Coast was still reeling from the devastation of Superstorm Sandy, Congress decided to do something about it: It passed the Natural Disaster Mitigation Act of 2011, which provides a tax credit of up to 25% of the cost of natural disaster mitigation projects on a taxpayer's property, the Washington Post reports. The law went into effect on Jan. 1 of that year, and it's already generating more than $100 million in tax credits, the Wall Street Journal notes. The credit is available only to homeowners who suffered "qualified natural disaster" damage to their property (i.e., from earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, or other natural disasters). But it's also available to property owners who suffered only "moderate" or "poor" natural disaster damage (i.e., from fires, floods, earthquakes, or other natural disasters). Some homeowners are taking advantage of the law, the Journal notes, but others aren't so sure. "I don't think it's a good idea," says a West Virginia resident who lost his home to a tornado in 2012. "I think it's a waste of money."

– If you're over the age of 5 and speak a language other than English at home, you may not be able to understand the proceedings of a court proceeding in your state. That's why the Justice Department has set aside $5 million to help states hire and train interpreters who can speak other languages, the Los Angeles Times reports. The money will go to 29 states that have already developed or are developing court interpreter programs, and it's part of a larger effort by the federal government to make sure people with limited English proficiency get a fair shake in the courtroom, the New York Times notes. The funding is part of an executive order issued in 2000 by President George W. Bush designed to make sure that people with limited English proficiency "understand judicial proceedings in which they are a party," per the Times. The funding is intended to help states recruit and train interpreters, as well as ensure that those who need them are available "whenever necessary," the Times notes. The grants will go to states that have a high number of people over the age of 5 who speak a language other than English at home, as well as those that have a high number of people over the age of 5 who speak a language other than English at home, the Times notes.

– The US government is allowing private companies to drill for oil and gas off the coast of Texas and Louisiana, despite sanctions against Iran and a ban on US companies doing business with the country's state-owned oil company, the Wall Street Journal reports. The move is in keeping with a law signed by President Obama in November that bans US companies from doing business with Iran's state-owned oil company, National Iranian Oil Company. The law also bans US companies from dealing with Iran's state-owned oil company, and it requires companies doing business with it to disclose any ties to Iran's nuclear program. A company that does business with Iran's state-owned oil company must also declare all ties to Iran's nuclear program, according to the law. A lawyer for the National Iranian Oil Company calls the law "absurd," the New York Times reports. "National Iranian Oil Company is not Iran's state-owned oil company," he says. "It is a private company." The US government, however, says the law doesn't apply to companies that do business with Iran's state-owned oil company. A company that does business with Iran's state-owned oil company must also declare all ties to Iran's nuclear program

– A whistleblower who filed a class-action lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler over faulty Jeep Grand Cherokees has been awarded more than $3 million, CNNMoney reports. The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in New York, claims the company knowingly sold more than 10 million vehicles with defective front-wheel-drive Jeeps in the US. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Cherokees were involved in more than 30 deaths and more than 100 crashes between 2000 and 2014. The lawsuit claims Fiat Chrysler knew about the problem, but did not report it to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and continued selling the vehicles. The amount awarded to the unidentified whistleblower is more than three times what the company paid to settle a similar lawsuit filed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year. The lawsuit claims Fiat Chrysler knew about the problem with the Cherokees as far back as 2000 but did not report it to theNHTSA and continued selling the vehicles. It also claims the company knew about a potential problem with the front-wheel-drive Jeeps in 2014 but did not report it to theNHTSA and continued selling them.

– The UN has more troops on the ground than anywhere else in the world, but it's in desperate need of more American soldiers. That's the message from the Pentagon, which is asking Congress to approve a plan to send up to 5,000 additional troops to places like Sudan, Afghanistan, and Haiti, reports the Wall Street Journal. The move is part of a larger effort by the Pentagon to beef up the US military's presence around the world, and it comes as the UN is under increasing pressure to get more troops on the ground after years of neglect, reports the New York Times. The US has sent more than 25,000 troops to places like Afghanistan and Iraq over the last decade, but the UN has been slow to send them to places like Sudan and Haiti, where the situation is far more dire. The new troops would bring the total number of US soldiers on the ground to about 54,000, and the Pentagon says they'll be used to help train local police and military forces, as well as provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, reports the Washington Post.

– If you're in the market for a new wireless phone, you'll soon have to settle for an old one—at least when it comes to data plans. The FCC is set to announce today that it will stop auctioning off spectrum to private companies and will instead sell it to the government, reports the Wall Street Journal. The move is part of a 2008 law designed to make it easier for the government to sell off its spectrum, which is used for everything from cell phone service to the Internet. The problem is that the private sector doesn't have the funds to do so, and the government doesn't have the funds to do so, either, reports the Washington Post. The result is that wireless carriers will have to sell off their own spectrum to pay for the government's, which could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. The move is expected to save the government billions of dollars in the long run, reports the New York Times, which notes that the private sector is expected to take the brunt of the hit. (The government is also expected to save billions in the long run because of the move.)

– It's been more than 70 years since the US territory of Puerto Rico became a territory of the United States, but its political status is still murky. The island has been ruled as a territory by the US commonwealth since 1898, but the island's 3.5 million residents are allowed to choose whether to remain a territory of the US or become a state, with a referendum on the latter possible by the end of 1998, the New York Times reports. Puerto Ricans can't vote on the latter option, but they can vote on the former if they want. The issue has been a thorny one for the island, which is mired in a decade-long recession and has been hit by a recession-related recession every year since 2006, the Times notes. Puerto Rico's government is deeply divided over the issue, with many favoring statehood, while others want the territory to remain a US territory. The Obama administration, however, has said that the territory can't become a state without congressional approval, and the Senate has passed a bill that would give the island that authority, the AP reports. The House has also passed a bill that would give the island more control over its budget, and Puerto Rico's governor has said he'd support a referendum on the latter option.

– If you're in the market for a new semi-automatic weapon, you'll likely want to take a look at Sig Sauer's line of "kits"—which, as the name suggests, allow you to assemble the weapon without the need for a magazine, NBC News reports. The "kits" are available on the company's website for as little as $60, and they come complete with a Sig Sauer M400 pistol, a Sig Sauer P400 rifle, and a Sig Sauer P400 shotgun. But if you're in the market for an actual gun, you'll have to settle for a set of three "kits" that come with a Sig Sauer M400 pistol, a Sig Sauer P400 rifle, and a Sig Sauer P400 shotgun.

– The US government has spent more than $100 million on trips to Cuba over the last 20 years—at a time when relations between the two countries are the worst they've been in 50 years, the New York Times reports. According to documents obtained by the Times, the State Department's Office of Inspector General has been investigating the US-Cuba Educational and Cultural Exchange Program for at least a year now, looking into whether it has been sending journalists to Cuba to report on issues like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the US-led invasion of Cuba in 1962. The office has also been looking into whether the US has been sending its own journalists to Cuba to report on issues like human rights and democracy, the Times reports. The US-Cuba Educational and Cultural Exchange Program was authorized by the Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 and the Television Broadcasting to Cuba Act of 1977 to "carry out international information activities, and educational and cultural exchange programs under the United States," according to the Times. The State Department's Office of Inspector General says it has found no evidence the program has been sending journalists to Cuba to report on issues like the Cuban Missile Crisis or the US-led invasion of Cuba in 1962, the Times reports. According to the Washington Post, the US-Cuba Educational and Cultural Exchange

– The Department of Veterans Affairs is rolling out a program that will provide free child care for up to four children of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, thanks to a law signed by President Trump earlier this month, the Hill reports. The law, which provides a stipend of up to $275 per month for veterans caring for children while they're receiving mental health care, is set to go into effect Oct. 1. It's not clear how many veterans will be eligible for the program, but it's expected to cost the government an estimated $115 million per year. "It's a small price to pay to protect our men and women in uniform, and it's a price we're going to have to pay," Sen. Bernie Sanders tells the New York Times. Sanders has been pushing for the program for years, and he was joined by Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who lost both her legs in Iraq, in signing the bill. It's not clear how many veterans will be eligible for the program, but it's expected to be a big help to those in rural areas who don't have easy access to child care.

– Smoking is bad for your health, but it's also bad for your health if you're on an Indian tribe's territory. That's the upshot of a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which finds that Native American adults who smoke are twice as likely as non-Indians to start smoking, the Los Angeles Times reports. The study, which looked at smoking rates among Native American adults between the ages of 18 and 44, also found that non-Indians are four times more likely to smoke than Native American adults. The researchers, who used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society, also found that Native American adults who smoke tend to be more likely to take up the habit later in life, and to smoke more often than non-Indians. The researchers found that Native American adults who smoke at least once a day are 2.5 times more likely to smoke than those who don't, and that smoking rates among Native American teens and young adults are 10 times higher than those among non-Hispanic whites. The researchers also found that Native American adults who smoke tend to be more likely to take up the habit later in life, and that smoking rates among Native American teens and young adults are 10 times

– New Jersey lawmakers have made it a lot easier for senior citizens to pay their property taxes, the Star-Ledger reports. Thanks to a law signed by Gov. Chris Christie last month, senior citizens can now deduct the entire cost of their property taxes, up to a maximum of $2,000 per year. The law was meant to help senior citizens who pay a lot of money in property taxes because they can no longer afford to keep their homes, but it's also meant to help senior citizens who can't afford to keep their homes because of the high cost of rent. "It's a win-win," says a senior advocate. "It's a win for the senior citizen, and it's a win for the state." Under the law, anyone over the age of 65 who owns property in New Jersey can now deduct the entire cost of their property taxes, up to a maximum of $2,000 per year. The maximum amount of deduction is $2,000 for individuals and $2,000 for a married couple filing a joint return.

– The EPA has a new program in place to help small communities deal with environmental issues, and it's designed to be as easy as possible for residents to apply. The program is called the Project SEARCH Act of 2000, and it's designed to help small communities that struggle to secure funding for environmental projects from more traditional sources, such as taxes or fines, reports the Los Angeles Times. The EPA says the new program doesn't require matching funds, so small communities can apply for up to $1 million in grants to help with things like wetlands and prairie restoration, reports the Wall Street Journal. The program is meant to help small communities that have a population of less than 2,500 people deal with environmental issues, but it's not without its problems. For example, a group in tiny Grants Pass, Ore., is fighting a proposed pipeline that would carry toxic waste from an old tannery to a treatment plant. The EPA says the new program will make it easier for small communities to apply for grants, but the group says the process is too complicated and the money won't be available until after the project is finished.

The office, the Senior Executive Service Resource Office, will make recommendations to the White House on how to boost the diversity of the branch, which numbers 660,000. It's not clear how far the office will go or how much it will cost, but the New York Times notes that it's unlikely to have much of an impact given the size of the branch.

– President Obama has signed a measure into law that will see the feds pumping billions of dollars into community banks to boost lending to small businesses. The measure is part of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, and the White House says it will help small businesses that have been unable to get loans during the financial crisis. "For generations, families and small businesses in under-served areas have for generations been unable to access affordable credit," Obama said in a statement. "The financial crisis of 2008 only served to exacerbate efforts by entrepreneurs to access capital for the purpose of creating jobs and improving economic outcomes in the community." The money will come from the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which the White House says is "well placed to make careful, targeted investments in community development financial institutions for the purposes of improving economic outcomes for underserved families across America." The measure is expected to create thousands of jobs, the New York Times notes.

– President Obama has signed an executive order designed to help communities along the US-Mexico border deal with illegal immigration, the AP reports. The order, which the White House says is the first of its kind, directs the EPA and other agencies to come up with plans to help communities along the border deal with drug trafficking, human smuggling, and other problems caused by undocumented immigrants. The order also calls for a review of existing programs to make sure they're helping the people who need them the most, and for the EPA to come up with recommendations for future programs to help the border community. The order, which will take effect Jan. 1, was signed by Obama at a White House ceremony with Mexican President Enrique Pe ⁇ a Nieto and other officials, the Los Angeles Times reports. It's not clear how many communities along the border are affected by the order, but the American Civil Liberties Union estimates there are up to 100,000. The order will help communities deal with a variety of problems, including crime, drug trafficking, and unemployment, the ACLU says.

– Amtrak's plan to build a second line from Portland, Ore., to New York City has met with some resistance from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who says the project is a "money-printing machine" that will hurt the state's economy and cost jobs. The New York Times reports that Cuomo has asked Amtrak to delay the project, which is expected to cost more than $20 billion, until he can figure out how to pay for it. The state's Economic Development Authority says it has no choice but to delay the project because of the "unprecedented" amount of money it will need to raise. Amtrak, however, says the project is on track and will create thousands of new jobs in New York City and the surrounding area, the AP reports. Cuomo's office says the delay is necessary because of the "unprecedented" amount of money it will need to raise. Amtrak, which is owned by the Federal Railroad Administration, says it plans to pay for the project with $2 billion in federal funds, $1.5 billion of which it will get from the Federal Railroad Administration and the rest from private investors. The company says the delay is necessary because of the "unprecedented" amount of money it will need to raise.

– The US-Mexico border is one of the world's most dangerous places for people to get sick, and a new law aims to remedy that. The Border Health Security Act, which was signed into law by President Obama last week, gives the US-Mexico Border Health Commission the authority to issue grants to help states and communities along the border fight diseases such as tuberculosis, diabetes, and obesity, the CBC reports. The law also calls for the commission to work with the Canada-United States Pan-Border Public Health Preparedness Council to help fight border health issues. The US-Mexico border is home to more than 15 million people, 75% of whom live within 100 miles of the border, and public health experts say the area is especially vulnerable to diseases like tuberculosis and Legionnaires' disease because of its 1,900 miles of porous borders and lack of medical facilities, the New York Times reports. The law also calls for the commission to work with the Mexican government to improve the health of Mexican immigrants living in the US, as well as with indigenous communities on both sides of the border, the CBC notes. The law's co-author, Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, says he hopes the law will help prevent the spread of diseases like Ebola, which has killed more

– If you're in the market for a new roof, you're in luck: There's a federal program that will give you a tax break on the cost of solar panels, wind turbines, and other "renewable energy" systems on your property, the Wall Street Journal reports. You can claim the credit on your federal tax return, and it's worth up to $50,000 for a single roof, thanks to a 1986 law called the "Renewable Energy Act for Credit on Taxes." The law allows you to claim a tax credit equal to 35% of the cost of your "renewable energy" system on your tax return, the Journal notes. The program is set to expire at the end of the year, but the Obama administration is pushing to have it extended until the end of 2015 so it can take effect as soon as Congress approves the extension, the New York Times reports. "This is a great time to be in the renewable energy business," says the president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. "It's a good time to be in the business."

– New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo today signed a bill into law to curb power-plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, the New York Times reports. The Acid Rain and Mercury Control Act was signed into law by President Obama in 2010, and it requires the EPA to cut emissions of the two pollutants by 50% by 2030. But the industry is fighting the measure, saying it's too expensive and that it won't be enough to make up for the Clean Air Act's cuts. "It's a sad day when the president of the United States chooses to put special interests ahead of the people," says the president of the New York Power Authority. The state is one of 28 that will be affected by the new law, and the Times notes that Cuomo signed the bill in front of an enthusiastic crowd at the State University of New York at Albany. The law will help fight acid rain, which occurs when nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide build up in the atmosphere and wreak havoc on ecosystems, including lakes in the Adirondacks, the Albany Times Union reports.

– If you're an employee of a small company with a 401(k) plan, you may want to think twice before socking away money in that plan for years to come. The Wall Street Journal reports on a new IRS rule that allows small companies with fewer than 50 employees to sock away up to $18,000 per year in 401(k)s. The rule, which went into effect last month, is designed to help small companies that don't have the resources to run their own 401(k) plans make the transition to one that's more easily accessible to their employees. "It's a win-win for both the employee and the company," an analyst tells the Journal. Employees of small companies who participate in 401(k)s get tax benefits while employers of the same size don't. "It's a win-win," the analyst says. Employees of small companies who participate in 401(k)s get those tax benefits while employers of the same size don't. Employees of small companies who sock away more than $18,000 per year in 401(k)s won't have to worry about paying taxes on that money when it comes time to sock it away for years to come.

– It's not the kind of thing you'd expect to see on the front page of a major newspaper, but that's exactly what's happened in West Virginia. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports that the state's Department of Local Government Services has been issuing interest-free loans to local governments in an attempt to balance the state's budget. The program was authorized in the State and Local Government Economic Empowerment Act of 2011, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which explains that the purpose of the act is "to promote economic development by providing low-interest loans to state and local governments for the purpose of funding capital projects." But West Virginia is one of more than a dozen states that haven't been able to get their hands on the funds, and the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports that the state has been forced to turn to the federal government for help. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, West Virginia's Department of Local Government Services has been issuing interest-free loans to local governments in an attempt to balance the state's budget for the past three years. The amount of the loans has gone down each year, and West Virginia has been forced to turn to the federal government for help because it hasn't been

– The House has passed a bill that would effectively block the EPA from regulating carbon dioxide, reports the Hill. The measure, known as the Small Business, Family Farms, andConstitutional Protection Act, would require the EPA to stop enforcing the Kyoto Protocol on climate change until the Senate ratifies it. The White House has threatened to veto the bill. The EPA argues that it has the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide, but the House argues that the agency has no authority to do so. The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, however, because climate change legislation is overwhelmingly opposed by Republicans.

– The estate tax is back in the news, and this time it's not because of the Bush tax cuts. Instead, it's because of a law passed by Congress in 2008 called the Sensible Estate Tax Act of 2008—or, as it's more commonly known, the " Sunset Not to Apply" law, the Wall Street Journal reports. The law, which was set to expire at the end of this year, allows the tax to be paid on estates that are worth more than $5 million a year, even if the taxpayer's annual income is less than that. The law was meant to help the poor, but it has turned out to be a headache for the rich, too, because it allows the tax to be paid on assets that are worth more than $5 million a year, even if the taxpayer's annual income is less than that. The Journal explains the law: "In the case of any decedent dying in a calendar year after 2008, the $2,000,000 amount in ... the rate bracket ... shall be increased by an amount equal to—(i) such dollar amount, multiplied by—the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year, determined by substituting—(ii) the cost-of-

– The Humane Society is suing the Humane Society of the United States for more than $75,000 in damages after the animal rights group accused the Humane Society of violating a federal law meant to protect the public's health, the Los Angeles Times reports. According to the suit, the Humane Society's undercover investigators visited a slaughterhouse in Flintstone's, Fla., and found unpasteurized meat and dairy products, as well as unpasteurized eggs, on the menu. The inspectors also found unpasteurized beef and dairy products, as well as unpasteurized eggs, on the menu at a restaurant owned by the Humane Society.

– The Pentagon's plan to build a $1.4 billion research facility on a former Navy base in South Carolina may have been a waste of money from the get-go, according to a report released Tuesday by the Government Accountability Office. The report found that the Pentagon's National Institute of Standards and Technology—which is in charge of the project—overestimated the cost of the project by $1 billion, even though it had been informed in 2009 that the cost would be closer to $750 million, the Washington Post reports. The GAO also found that the project was over budget by more than $100 million despite the fact that the institute had been told in 2009 that the cost would be closer to $500 million, the Post reports. The GAO report also found that the project was over-budget by more than $1 billion despite the fact that the institute had been told in 2009 that the cost would be closer to $750 million.

Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, was one of the first to call for the GAO report after it was released. "It's outrageous that the Department of Defense is spending billions of dollars on a project that has nothing to do with national security," he said in a

– The Department of Housing and Urban Development has been accused of racial bias in its hiring practices—and now a federal judge has ordered the department to explain why it's discriminating against African-Americans, the Washington Post reports. According to a letter from US District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein to HUD chief Julian Castro, the department has been using race as a factor in its hiring decisions. The letter notes that African-Americans make up just 43% of the department's workforce, but they make up 60% of its new hires. The department has been hiring people based on their race, rather than their income, the judge says, and that's a "complete disregard for the dignity of African-Americans." The letter also notes that the department has been using race as a factor in its hiring decisions for years, but it hasn't done a good job of explaining it. "The department’s hiring practices are racially biased, and the department’s hiring decisions are racially biased as well," Hellerstein writes. He wants the department to explain why it's discriminating against people based on their race, and to give him a list of people who have been discriminated against in the past.

– The Department of Veterans Affairs is taking a new look at how it deals with veterans with substance abuse problems—and it's not going to wait for Congress to figure out what to do. Instead, it's setting up its own peer-reviewed research program to look at the effects of alcohol and other drugs on veterans, reports the Los Angeles Times. "We're going to look at the long-term effects of these drugs on veterans," says a VA official. "We're not going to rush to judgment, but we're going to look at the long-term effects of these drugs on veterans." The move comes as the Pentagon is trying to get a handle on the problem of PTSD among troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, reports the New York Times. It's not clear how the program will be paid for, but it's expected to cost at least $50 million over five years.

– When Bank of America was bailed out in 2009, it did so with the help of a little-known provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974—or, as it's more commonly known, the "Worker-Executive Parity Act of 2009." As the Wall Street Journal explains, the act requires companies that offer pensions to employees to set aside money for the eventuality that they may be forced to sell their assets to repay the pension funds. In Bank of America's case, that money came out of the company's deferred-compensation account, and it was set to be paid out once the bank was able to sell its assets to repay the pension funds. But when the bank filed for bankruptcy, it was forced to sell its assets to repay the pension funds, and it didn't have the money to do so. As a result, it had to sell the assets to repay the pension funds, even though it had promised to keep the money in the deferred-compensation account until the pension funds were paid out. The bank ended up paying more than $100 million to the pension plans of thousands of employees, even though it had promised to keep the money in the deferred-compensation account. The Journal calls the bank's
