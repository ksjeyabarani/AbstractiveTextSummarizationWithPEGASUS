oral melanoma is an extremely rare tumor arising from the growth of melanocytes found in the basal layer of oral mucous membrane . it occurs between 30 and 90 years of age , with a higher incidence in the 6th decade with a mean age of 56 years . it is having a higher prevalence in yellows , blacks , japanese , and indians of asia due to more frequent finding of melanin pigmentation in oral mucosa of these races . green et al . described criteria for diagnosis of primary oral melanoma which includes demonstration of melanoma in the oral mucosa , presence of junctional activity , inability to demonstrate extraoral primary melanoma . a total of 80% to 90% of oral malignant melanoma arises in the mucosa of maxillary jaw with a majority occurring on the keratinized mucosa of hard palate and gingiva .. these are mostly asymptomatic and detected only when there is ulceration or hemorrhage of the overlying keratin epithelium. delayed detection may be the cause for the poor prognosis with a 5-year survival being between 15% and 38% . the purpose of this article is to present a case of oral malignant melanoma , as well as to emphasize the necessity for early recognition and treatment of this lesion .
