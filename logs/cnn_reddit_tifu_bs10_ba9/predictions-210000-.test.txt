our teacher asked us to make an interview in french as a proyect, my friends and i made a pretty long video (compared to the other teams)
The first 4 minutes everyone was bored af, because that's the only serious part, but then shit hits the fan and the memes start to appear .
At the end there is an akward silence in the classroom and our teacher only says "well... everyone can have artistic liberty"

sex is messy kids. bring a towel..
i was at my girlfriends house, when we decided we should watch a movie.
at the time her parents were not home and we sometimes use their room because they have a better tv and surround sound.
i ended up getting a couple of drops on her whilst the rest of my spunk distributed to various other unintended surfaces. up on her parents' pillows, sheets, wall, you name it.
i'm sitting there dick in hand just accepting my fate. the sheets could not be changed as that would be obvious, like the stains.

im trying to figure out how to ask and what to say but i overthink and it by the time i look outside the window we are already here.
oh my...the glare of pure hatred. just staring into my soul and to make it worse the little bundle of joy makes a funny sound and i just start to laugh and just, oh my. no words could ever be said to describe that look.

My aunt has a mg midget that has to be from the 1500 series- the black plastic bumpers are a big tell. now, it's got some issues as well.
the leather is not in pristine condition, and she said the key is stuck in the ignition.
She's told me i can drive it before, but i've never actually done it. so i'm housesitting this week and decided it would be a good time to see if the car even runs.
i turn the key and the engine won't turn over. no big deal, i figured it wouldn't start.

i deposited some skins and they just wouldn’t show up in my inventory on that site... so i typed in the chat that there’s a problem with my deposit .
a few minutes later a  ⁇ moderator“ of that gambling site texted me that he would look into my issue... while looking into the issue the system of said site offered me a refund .
he then told me that he had to exchange the items because they were compromised and ed out (those were around $50-60 in value)
-----:5
so today i was tasked with taking care of my cousins daughter while he my mom and some of her other family members went out to town and got drunk.
i ended up falling asleep. next thing i know i have my mom, drunk as hell beating me with a flyswatter calling me a dumb goat.
it was around 12pm and they had gotten home, all drunk, yelling at me to go get the girl.
turns out she ran outside, somehow had climbed a tree, a good 13-14 feet and was too scared to climb down.

after an exam in our free time before a revision session, we went to my friend's and played some mortal kombat before we went back to school.
with sarah was her friend who i had barely spoken to before, she seemed really nice and i quite liked her.
fast forward to later at lunch, i was with another person who was also at sarah's house, she suggested it would be funny if she gave me the girls number and we 'prank-texted' her.

i worked with my dad in a very small business which i sort of followed him around since i was little and when i was around 21 and still in college my dad begged me to come home .
My entire home got the flu, me, three boys wife, dad, we all lived in the same house, but my dad was diagnosed with mild bronchitis and given antibiotics to treat .
A week later he's still not feeling well and decides to tell me then that he hasn't been eating .

i was making a new chili recipe for my friends, and after i got everything to simmer and chopped the garnishing i had to take a piss .
i should point out that one of the garnishes that i had just chopped was jalape ⁇ os. i was reminded of this when my dick and balls were engulfed in white hot pain.
-----:9
after about 30 minutes i had the urge to go to the bathroom .
After about 20 more minutes of being in the ocean i see police cars and crowds of people start to pull up to the bathroom .
 turns out the showers were broken and the smell was so bad they thought something died .
-----:10
myki is a universal ticket system for buses, trains and trams.
i keep mine in my wallet, next to my debit card.
i decided i should stop bringing my debit card to school, so i'm not tempted to buy anything from the cafe.
i took a card out of my wallet and went to school.
i've just now realised i've been stealing public transport for about half a week when i looked through my wallet and found my debit card, but not my myki.
-----:11
fti made eye contact with her at her strip cub yadda yadda yadda yadda she takes me to a private area for dances .

-----:12
i started watching wwe for the first time in years.
my brothers abandoned their soccer game to watch wwe with me while i explained the rules and told them about my favorite wrestlers. they were absolutely captivated.
a week after i introduced them to wwe, they began to have wrestling matches just like they have in the show. they even picked their characters and acted like they do in the show!
but above all else, my brothers' favorite character is hornswoggle.
 hornswoggle is one of the wrestlers, with the catch being that he's a dwarf.
-----:13
i'm a very light sleeper and typically wear ear plugs during the night.
i woke up at approximately 3am needing to go to the bathroom.
i go to the bathroom pee and decide i'm also thirsty so i'm going to head to the kitchen and get a drink of tea.
i proceed to the kitchen, open fridge, and get a drink of tea. as i'm getting my drink i think i hear something outside, most likely nothing but i'm a little startled since i can't hear so well with my ear plugs in.
-----:14
this literally happened not but 30 minutes ago and i'm still sitting here bashing my head on the table.
there's this girl in one of my history classes, cute girl from my high school but a grade below and we hadn't interacted until this class.
well we quickly recognize each other (went to a smallish private high school) talk a bit here and there no more than outside of class, but got along pretty well. so a few weeks ago we become facebook friends and we talk more since.
-----:15
when i was a kid, my dad would fetch me from school and take me to his office where i stayed until he finished his work.
to pass the time, i wander around the office and a physiology book got my attention.
i loved science books - even college level books pique my interest as long as they have lots of pictures.
i managed to pass the test in all four plates.
i called my dad and showed him the four plates, asking him if he saw the same numbers. he was weirded out. "are you sure there are numbers on the others?"
-----:16
chinese subways are typically very crowded during rush hours, so no matter how shaky things get people don't ever fall over because one would just end up leaning against another body.
i popped a piece of gum in my mouth and dozed off for a while leaning against the door.
my brain decided it would be appropriate to follow the corny bullshit that always happens in movies in this scenario.
i extended my arm and wrapped it around her shoulders, slowly bring her to a gentle stop.
i felt like the smoothest fucking asshole in the whole fucking universe.
-----:17
recently i feel like i've been inching out of the friend zone, so i've been trying to flirt and impress her a bit more.
i instinctively looked up her flight on flightaware.com, and looked at the flight plan. she was flying into reagan national which is especially interesting to me considering all the restricted airspace around it.
i told her at how many feet should would be flying, cruising, what waypoints they would hit, what she could see out her window, and what gate she would be pulling up to.
-----:18
last month i had a terrible experience with my 2nd primary care physician (let's call him dr.g)
my new insurance doesn't cover him so i only see him sometimes because i have to pay out of pocket .
the bad experience happened during my April appointment with dr. g when he didn't show up to work for two hours .
i almost passed out that morning and my pain level was high. he gruffly called me to his office and felt like shit .
-----:19
i was raised with a dog and having one to play with and pet on and love and get love from was a great deal to me .
 jack (the labrodor retriever) had to be put down when i was 9. but we got a new dog soon after named turner. he's a pit-bull/boxer mix and he's a true best friend to this day .
when i was 12 we decided to get turner a friend. a little brother if you will.
these dogs are the best of friends to each other and me .
-----:20
"i just made this account to share my horrible experience that i recently had with coca cola"
i've been slowly draining their supply of coke. one day (not today, this was actually two days ago) i decide to get one out of the back, for no particular reason.
i go upstairs, open it up, and pour a large glass.
i feel particles in my mouth.
it tastes foul.
i remember my dad talking to me about five days ago:
"be careful julian, we've been having a rat problem in the basement"
-----:21
when i opened the door, i couldn't help but notice the entire lobby of the college building that was usually full of people was completely empty .
so, i make my way through the empty halls to the room where my class usually is and couldn't help but say "what the fuck?" out loud when i noticed the lights in the classroom were out and the door was locked .
when i looked at the calendar, i thought the test was on Thursday, the 8th. turns out i overshot by a couple of days and the test was actually on Tuesday .
-----:22
the smoke alarm has been beeping lately due to low battery, so i finally decided to switch the battery out.
i swapped the battery and left the detector to find some ear plugs and test the new battery when the room suddenly started to smell funny.
when i picked up the smoke detector, smoke was leaking out from its grille. turned out i had put the 9v battery in the wrong way, overheating the the battery and heating up the circuits inside (that is the explanation for now at least). not sure if ifu or sdfu, but quite ironic, don't you think?
-----:23
i decided to retire my stretched earlobes due to wanting to join the military .
I was so blown away by how much they shrunk, that i decided to share a photo to my best buddy on snapchat .
i followed through and tried to jam my old plugs back into my stupid shrunken hole, and i managed to force the fucker back in .
i almost immediately regretted that decision due to the amount of pain, redness, and swelling i felt after doing the deed .
-----:24
i was in barcelona with my family, celebrating my dads 50th birthday.
after a tiring day of following my brothers gf and my mom around on their shoppingspree, we went back to the hotel.
i didn't really get a good breakfast, so i go to buy a snack from the vending machine ( i didn't want to starve before dinner) after carefull consideration, i decide on a tuna sandwich.
 im salivating, so i'm used to old fish and didn't think it would be a problem. oh how i was wrong.
-----:25
q showed me a message he recieved from a girl he had not so recently started talking to, telling about how she had helped my friend g cheat on his girlfriend .
i think this was because he still didnt know what to do, and didnt want anyone else involved yet .
i went to my closest friend n, completely forgetting q as q and g don't know each other that well. as n is closer to g than i am, it felt right to include her .
-----:26
/r/showswithdogs is not a subreddit. replace shows with a synonym for gender and rhymes with chex, and there you have it.
It plays for a few seconds before i rush to smash the back button on my phone. does anyone else's phone get unresponsive when its rained on too much? my shitty kyocera does.
i texted her something about as long as this post trying to explain myself, but she hasn't texted me back and probably never will.
-----:27
during my sophomore year of high school, i joined band to get my art credit. one thing that i liked about band was how class was outside when it was warm, which was always a good time.
on one occasion that i did this, a bee happened to fly right past me, and i sucked it right into my mouth.
-----:28
this happened before i was married... if you see this sweet heart i'm sorry.
i saw a woman on the side on the road hitchhiking. normally i wouldn't notice a hitchhiker but i was in a weird mood and felt like helping.
unfortunately i didn't ask until she was sitting down.
i want you to picture a 5'7 140lb 18 year old white kid and a 6 foot tall 110lb obnoxiously dressed hooker running down a main road.
it took over an hour to explain my way out of it. the hooker ended up telling the truth.
-----:29
i'm usually a pretty chill guy so i don't like to bring it up and be the debby downer so i usually do a little white lie .
well, my sister died 7 years ago, and i'm a pretty chill guy so i don't like to bring it up and be the debby downer so i usually do a little white lie .
Now this doesn't seem that bad, but the kicker is that my dad's the boss..
i need to fix this prior to my dad thinking i'm disillusion and need a psychologist .
-----:30
my father and i always buy enough meat and poultry to plan out meals for nearly a month.
we get the selections home, portion them out into freezer bags, and bring the next choice out of the freezer to thaw as needed.
our selection this time was four chicken leg quarters to bake in cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup.
my dad didn't have it as severely, as he had only the mildly contaminated water. he got over it in a week and a half, it took me a month.
-----:31
when i was in 6th grade my cabin counselor told us to dress warm because we were all going to go on a hike all together .
As soon as we stepped outside into the foot deep snow, i instantly had to pee .
about 30 minutes into the hike my buddy notices me walking a little funny (i was prancing around trying to hold my bladder in)
he asked me what was wrong, but for some reason i wouldn't tell him.
my bladder released and the front of my jeans began to soak through the clean white snow .
-----:32
i’m a pretty heavy weed smoker, and just recently got a new job which requires a pre employment drug screening .
i’m only small (100lbs but i eat a lot of junk food, but have a high metabolism so i figured I might have a shot at getting clean!) .
i quit smoking Sunday morning and it was the hardest thing i ever had to do.
i go down to the local hemp store to find some sort of cleanse kit to flush my system even faster.
i get down and this working is like “dudee, try this super pill, works every time”
-----:33
i was told to drill holes into some .44 mag.
the other half fell into one of the brass bins and i really didn't feel like looking for it, and i had work to do.
i was drilling away, then i came to the casing that almost signed my death warrant.
i start drilling, it makes it through the top side and then i don't even know what happened, all i know is that i saw the casing go one way and heard something fly by my ear, between my head and the arm holding the lever of the drill press, and hit the wall behind me.
-----:34
i bought a bag of gummy bears and was going to eat them in bed and go straight to sleep .
I always throw my wallet in the air and see if I can make it land directly this small tray on my dresser .
i guess the moral of this story is never buy a bag of gummy bears at 1 in the morning, come home and throw your wallet across your room onto a small tray .
Fortunately i had accidental insurance on my ps4 but my tv and phone are both ruined .
-----:35
i had forgotten that i had an ear wax dissolvent bottle that looked exactly the same shape and size of my eye drop bottle.
i put one drop in and felt immediate pain.
i rushed to the bathroom and rinsed my eye out for a good 5 minutes, and i took a wet cloth and dabbed my eye every now and than for about an hour.
-----:36
now, just to be clear, i haven't been into the automobile-driving business long- probably about 5 months into it .
i've just recently learned that i had my high-beam switch perpetually forward, which means that every time, every instance i used my headlights, my high-beams would also turn on .
-----:37
last night i went to a party and ended up hooking up with this foreign girl. we came back to my place, had sex and went to sleep.
this morning i was awaken by my brother calling me (him and i live together)
he told me to come outside of the room and then asked me how much did i drink and if i brought a crazy drunk girl over.
i was like "yeah, i brought a girl over but she's okay, not crazy"
-----:38
This happened 3 days ago, but i didn't have time to write it until now.
It was time to go to my college orientation. to all the foreigners out there, orientation is a two day event at the college/university that you will be going to in the fall at which you get to know the place and register for classes and whatnot.
in the fall i will be going to the university of in the twin cities, which is about 2.5 hours away from where i live.
orientation starts at 8:15, i had to leave my house at 5:30am to make good time.
-----:39
so this happened a few years ago but still makes me cringe whenever i think about it .
i eventually quit the job a few months later because i felt the constant pressure made me lose focus whenever i needed it most .
-----:40
i worked with a youth group in a particular neighbourhood and knew a lot of the parents. this one lady in particular was always very warm and we would chat often.
One day i see her on the bus pushing a stroller with a baby in it and with the most emphatic smile i can muster up i look her right in the eyes and give her the warmest "hello, how are you doing?". she doesn't respond.
i just kind of take my seat and feel like i was just punched in the face. then i doubt myself, maybe it's not her.
-----:41
recently broke up with my 6months gf (she was 24) but it was agreed from both side.
wasn't really feeling down or anything and i wanted some break from all the dating stuff just to think about myself a bit.
i also play a really popular game during my free times, called league of legends.
last week i had a game with this one person, we'll call her carol, with whom i had a really great time.
we started playing whenever i came from work and i was surprised she was always home so early but i never questionned it.
-----:42
i had the hubris to believe that my trusty flash drive i keep on me every second of every day would never jump ship.
 subsequently this hubris made me lazy and i didn’t back up my files on my flash drive to my computer, or drive, or cloud.
i’m now going to spend the rest of my day looking for it or else there’s going to be no point of being in college.
if i don’t find it, i think i’m going to drop out, move towns, change my name, and life calling. don’t tell me i shouldn’t.
-----:43
One of my irrational fears is that i will forget to lock the bathroom door at work, and someone will open it on me mid-stream (i'm a male)
i was walking around the halls while the students were in class, and i decided to stop at the faculty restroom on my way back to my classroom.
the door has a lock on it, and when someone locks it from the inside, a sign says "occupied" on the outside of the door.
so i look twice at the door to make sure it does not read "occupied" as i always do.
-----:44
when i was in pre-k i became friends with this girl and we ended up going to the same schools up into high school .
One day in drafting class me and my best friend were talking about the girl and i was mentioning how she was beautiful kind etc.
A muscular baseball player starts talking louder so we hear announcing we are talking about his girlfriend.
the boyfriend then gets a bit more agitated and threats to fight me.
the teacher calms us down and the guys girlfriend peaks her head in the class and tells only me "hey (my name)!" and says nothing to her boyfriend .
-----:45
i didn't want to be the adam sandler of gift giving. even adam sandler doesn't want to be adam sandler anymore.
i thought of the best idea ever. a coffee mug that is the size of donald trump's ego.
i get to work in my garage, working like an energized umpa loompa that dripped the sweet sweat of passion.
a glorious cylinder of pure, caffeinated, bowel-wrecking, goodness.
-----:46
i found an old container of concentrated weedout and went to work.
conveniently, the container had a built-in spray nozzle attached to a tube - no need to tilt it and risk spilling it anywhere.
so i happily sprayed each and every dandelion i saw in the driveway.
today, i put the container on a shelf in the shed, washed my hands, and forgot about it.
the nozzle was sitting on the shelf next to the mostly emptied container - fuckfuckfuck - surrounded by a sticky puddle of half-crystallized weed killer.
-----:47
ryan air demanded we pay $100 per person to print our boarding passes .
Instead of printing our boarding passes, the lady in the little booth wrote on a piece of paper our names and confirmation number .
thank you ryan air. why stop at $100 per person. i would have paid $200 per person, or even $400 per person.
-----:48
after an incident where my house almost exploded and i almost set off a nuke (metal in microwave) i have to leave the room when the kettle or microwave is on .
during a strange absence of muscle control walking down an escalator i can't go near the bastards without someone i know .
after leaving my window open for far too long during an all nighter playing far cry 3, my room was covered in midgies .
-----:49
i was talking to my 14 y/o niece, who is a high school basketball player .
She is worried about a girl in her class who's really good at basketball, and while we were talking, she remarked that this girl would likely take the spot she's going for .
i made a tongue-in-cheek comment to the effect that she should "tonya harding" the other girl .
i asked "do you know what happened with tonya harding and nancy kerrigan?" she said she had no idea what i was talking about.
-----:50
"visitors must wear plastic bags on their feet"
"the sign totally said to wear the bags underthat, you're golden"
"after a few questions the main interviewer stopped me and advised me that there was a building site next door"
"after a short silence the interview continues but in a much more sombre fashion. they're now basically intervieiwing someone who, after being told they don't need to wear that stupid Mexican sombrero, is still wearing it"
-----:51
my gf has a super strict moral code about these sorts of things, and she kicked me out of her apartment and hasn't talked to me since.
i tried to explain that it was a drunken mistake, but to no avail. my gf has a super strict moral code about these sorts of things, and she kicked me out of her apartment and hasn't talked to me since.
-----:52
i left my job interview building, just to discover my public transport bus has stopped on the other side of the road.
and then i fell.
i was just lying on the road, groaning, until some kind man offered his help. he called for an ambulance, it came, and the first question from the doctor was: "was this the last bus?" no.
during the time we were waiting for the ambulance, three buses went by.
turned out i have a fracture behind the knee. plaster for the next six weeks. no flowers for my grandma either.
-----:53
This is where it all went wrong.
my session started out pretty nice, good video, nice stroking motion. but it just wasn't doing it.
i being a kinky fucker kinda liked it and shoved that finger even deeper. about 2 mins in the i'm edging and the burning is intensifying.
not to be swayed i keep going, 3 mins and i feel like someone replaced my finger with a ghost pepper, 3min30secs and i yank the fucker out allow myself to bust and sprint to the bathroom.
-----:54
one of the girls, let's call her kay, had noticed i act a certain way when i feel like I'm being ignored or excluded from the group.
We have even side hugged as she was leaving group before.
last night, our group was having a going away party for someone who is moving away for a job. one of our regular attendees (another guy) typically likes to give side hugs to all the girls as they leave.
i even had to run down half way down the stairs to catch 2 of them as they were leaving.
-----:55
whenever i fall asleep and smell my bed sheets, go to a concert, or simply do my everyday routine, i get turned on whenever i psychologically think that a certain item smells like pussy (or may potentially smell like it).
i don't know why, but i greatly enjoy the smell.
i sometimes try to imitate the smell by working out, massage my dick, and add some saliva, or pour some distilled white vinegar onto new polyester clothes, but those smells never come close to the ideal smell.
-----:56
i got sick about four days ago and haven't left my hotel room for more than 20 minutes at a time since .
fast forward to today and still i haven't left my hotel room for more than 20 minutes at a time since i got sick.
i had a light breakfast and decided that i was going to go to the beach.
When all of a sudden, i need to shit *now*. so i get up and hobble over to the washroom with my butt muscles tensed up as to not leak liquid shit everywhere.
-----:57
i am trying to hold my laugh in this old lady, easely in her 75-80 years rolls up to me in a wheelchair and wants to ask me something, i look up at her and rip one of my in-ear headphones out, letting the other one stay in.
i hear another fucking hillarious joke, i almost double over from this while this old lady looks really hurt and sad. she rolls on to another street and i am just sitting there.
i dont realise what i have done untill like 5 seconds after she is gone, i grab my things and run off too embarased.
-----:58
my crush name’s started with an o, so i’ll call her oprah.
i printed like 15 pages of that stuff and hid them in my sock drawer or in my books. one day, my mother came in abruptly while my porno was out and i immediately hid them in one of my school books. for whatever reason oprah, who never visits me (she’s not even a friend but my mother knew hers), needed to borrow a book to do her schoolwork.
oprah stormed out and started whipping my ass for being the little pervert i am.
-----:59
i live in istanbul -turkey and there is a rather interesting type of public transport here called "minibus"
basically it is a small bus that goes on a planned route but doesn't have specific stations.
i don't remember very well but i had some errands to do on the other side of the city (i lived in european side and i had to cross istanbul bosphorus to go on asian side) so i decided to catch a ferry.
i put on the best looking outfits according to my 16 years old brain and left the house feeling like eros.
-----:60
i get a text from my friend saying she was headed home and could give me a ride since i lived along the way .
 so i pack my things and walk out the building towards the parking lot .
it just so happens to be a -20 degree with -30 degree cel windchill kind of night .
as i approach the parking lot i see a white car resembling that of my friend's with its headlights on .
i noticed that there was seat cover draped over the passenger seat that i didn't recall ever being there .
-----:61
i'd never tried kool-aid fizzy, so thought it was worth a try .
i tore open one of the sachets, opened the bottle of fizzy water, and poured the whole satchet in. crossing the kitchen to get something to mix the powder with, i heard a fizzing sound.
i ran back to the bottle to transfer it to the sink, but it was too late - in my efforts to contain the fountain of undiluted kool-aid, i'd got the stuff _everywhere_!
-----:62
my fuck up happened early this morning and things have just calmed down enough that i now have time to type this.
i was doing some work up in a mechanical room of a hospital. an easy set up and removal of insulation, or so i thought.
sitting on a duct, finishing removal when a piece of insulation got wrapped around a valve without me knowing.
i had no idea the valve was there, nor was it tagged or locked off. but needless to say, i ended up with gallons upon gallons of water gushing out over this duct.
-----:63
i got up early today, and cleaned the bathroom, including the vanity and counter.
i shoved everything onto the edge of the bath tub, with the intention of putting it back after breakfast.
cue my husband waking up, and stumbling into the bathroom to splash his face with water, brush his teeth, and comb his hair.
then i hear: "hey, sweetie, did you get different toothpaste? this tastes really weird".
-----:64
in the game you're allowed to take photos with the camera and save them on your memory card .
The kid on the controller has never done it before so he practices using it.
 complete silence fell over the room of about 6 other kids. complete silence fell over the room of about 6 other kids.
Luckily the kid on the controller must have felt my awkwardness because he exited the camera screen after a couple seconds and kept playing like nothing happened.
-----:65
after eating the bun i felt dozens of the poppy seeds stuck between my teeth .
As i entered the school i remembered that chewing gum is forbidden inside the school .
i got back home at around 8pm because my friends wanted to go to the city center to buy some stuff and i think i could've gotten home later if it wasn't for the urge to take a dump. when i got home i rushed to the toilet and released all that was within but i got a strange feeling...
-----:66
i was nineteen, in college, and dating this incredible woman.
we had talked on the internet for a year before she came to the same college i was attending.
i don't ask her too much, but i do let slip that it would be really hot to see her with another woman.
what follows is a three-day romp through the pleasures of sex i never knew existed to that point. there was very little internet back then, certainly no porn websites like now.
-----:67
so i should preface this by saying this happened a week ago .
i had chinese food for dinner the previous night, and i figured i could eat it for breakfast when i woke up the next morning .
i thought i'd poke a hole in the top to vent the steam. step one of my fuck-up is complete.
i take the knife, and press it into the plastic while it's in my hand. i keep going, thinking i'd be able to stop the knife from going through the second half of the plastic. proceed to stage three of my monumental fuckup.
-----:68
during our junior year, his mom apparently got very sick. he took a leave of absence to be with her. eventually, she passed away .
he returned to our school a year later, restarting his junior year while me and the rest of our class were in our senior year. due to his maturity, he had actually been closest with people in the classes ahead of us .
we bonded over the usual things, funny jokes, puns, and silly youtube videos or tv shows. we both liked clever humor and puns in particular, and both like somewhat dark, morbid humor as well .
-----:69
when i was going on a family vacation, we needed to take the plane.
because my grandfather was sick and we wanted to change the time of departure if something bad had happened to him.
we had business-class tickets, because that's one of the plusses with business clas.
Because we had business-class tickets we went in a very quick line('cause that's one of the plusses with business clas) and we are amazingly quickly at the end of security and my handbag is the last one through.

i opened his gallery to find pictures and videos of him with other women .
During the first 3 months of our relationship he had been avidly flirting with multiple women .
it nearly lead to us breaking up...it still might become the reason of our eventual breakup .
i'm trying to make the relationship work despite my lack of trust because i love him but it seems like it may not work if i keep finding things our relationship is going through quite a bit of tension .

i'm in a class that i know no one and being the only guy.
i can barely interact w/ people of my own gender, this is hell incarnate for me.
the only reason i'm planning on staying in this class is: raise my fitness level & maybe if i'm dropped in the worst situation for my social phobia maybe it would go away.

so i ordered a tamron 18-200mm lens for my camera nikon d5200 and i thought i would test it out on some star shots.
 now there are scratches on it and when i shake it rattling occurs, i will just have to see what happens.

pyronius, sylar, and kevin come out with the manager hot in pursuit yelling for them to stop.
the cop parked outside the store turns on his lights and sprinting out after them.
"oh fuck guys, stop. it's the cops"
ricky pulls into the parking lot when a sudden commotion begins at the front of the store.
laronda decides that next time she'll go to target.

i live in an apartment complex that has underground parking and outside lot parking.
in order to park in the lot, you have to be a resident of the complex and have a parking placard.
if you don't you either need to park in the visitor designated parking area, or on the street.
 usually i park in the underground, and have been for years.
the one day, i went to work, and did some errands, how ever i took down the placard hanging from my rear view mirror so i could drive without it distracting me, and put it on the little shelf above my glove compartment.
-----:75
i woke up in the morning with a severe hang over and a rumbly in my tumbly.
i was sleeping on my side in my shitty little dorm room twin bed and let loose with a massive alcohol powered rotten machine gun fart.
i heard her gasp and gag but there was no escape.
we never spoke of this event but it was seared in my mind, and surely hers as well.

54" board, 10 feet high - the whole deal.
in this model the pole extends forward at an angle, so you don't slam into it when you are trying to dunk a ball.
got so excited after finally assembling it and eager to try, i only partially filled the base with water while figuring out the best place to put it on a driveway.
Rain storm came in the afternoon with wind gusts, and the whole fucking thing came crashing down right onto my wife's car straight through the windshield.
-----:77
i have always been a big kid/guy, and i have a shy bowel making it hard to use a bathroom anywhere that there are a lot of people .
i told myself i could make it the 4 days/3 nights until we went home without using the bathroom to shit, planning on pissing every day in the lake during swim time .
i realized that with all my overeating and not having had a single shit in close to 70 hours i must be incredibly backed up .

"Hey bro, let us get drinks on you, and we'll pay cash for your beer"
"i'm not very trusting of seemingly shady assholes put me in a bit of a skeptic vibe"
"he goes to order said drink, but before doing so, looks at me and says, "cause you guys are together right?" thinking he was just making small talk and asking if we were dating"
"he gives me a funny look and says "oh.. ok". and then proceeds to pull out cash and pay for all our drinks but without ordering the one for her"

My friend's mother is a real-estate agent .
She showed up at my door and hands me an envelope and says "its no big deal but i don't want your mom to worry this Christmas" she tells me to give it to my mom and leaves.
Now look i live in a suburb of  Detroit so 300$ is quite a lot of money to people aorund here, when my friend's family did live around here they were easily some of the richest people in town.

3 weeks ago, i got a job at a grocery store as a stock boy.
about 8:30 when my manager says he wants to talk to me in the office.
i asked what he meant by "let me go," we were slow so i figured i could just leave early.
nope. just a polite way of saying you're fired (apparently doesn't go on your record but not the point)
i really felt like i was doing a way better job than they thought i was.
-----:81
my friend sees my gum on my desk and asks if he can have some. not caring i tell him sure and continue working.
he places the gum back down closed and says he will talk to me later about making plans.
Later that day i decide i want some gum so i grab my hubba bubba and open it...
there is a huge bite right in the middle of my hubba bubba tape.
i thought people only did this on 4chan or reddit for people to rage, not to actually do it to someone. idk if he and i can be friends anymore...
-----:82
last night, i went to a friend's dorm to drink beer and pretend to be irish for a day. at some point, i blacked out for about an hour. apparently, i decided i was going to bed and stripped down to my boxers.
my friend went to his girlfriends room, leaving me asleep in bed.
blacked out me did not prop the door open, so i have no way of getting back into the room.
unfortunately for me, the elevators require a key to get to any other floor, and i don't even know which floor he's on.
-----:83
i was with my parents in the living room discussing my future vehicle (both of them are sobber during this part but just began to pound down shots)
after about 30 minutes, it is kicking in, and they are arguing about being fat, and who's more fat (odd argument i guess, but hey sounds kinda funny!).
well it changes quickly into a past sex life of theirs, now that should have been the point in time where i just noped the fuck on out of there, but i didn't.
-----:84
i recently started hooking up with a girl i knew from high school. we are 22 now, and just realized we were a decent match.
i decided to try and assert my male dominance. mistake.
i thought a slap on the ass would be just perfect. not too hard, but enough to get the message across.
my arm moves around and i start the slight whip-like motion so that it i get a nice "pop" as my hand lands.
my stomach drops, and my mouth starts salivating.
-----:85
i was in my language arts class last Thursday and we had to do an essay, but i finished early so i decided to take a nap .
unfortunately that peaceful nap turned into a rape filled nightmare.
the dream started with me walking down a road and a man following me, i noticed so i started walking faster, so did he.
it turned into an all out sprint and i just couldn't run fast enough.
right as he put his cock in my ass i woke up and screamed the loudest scream i think i've ever produced in my life.
-----:86
peppermint extract is up to 90% pure alcohol .
It's beyond any reasonable doubt the most unenjoyable substance i have ever consumed .
i know it should have happened way sooner, but this is when i temporarily dropped a fat n o p e all over the situation.
i played the "you can't fucking do that here, look where we are" card, and got at least some of her clothes back on.
it seems like that's where it should have ended, but for some reason all 3 of us just entirely lacked any sort of moral compass.
-----:87
i went out to get coffee at about 1am, because why not?
i trekked down to the shop to get cash out, and ended up talking to the cashier for about 40 minutes about his whole life story.
it was pretty interesting, but then i really wanted my coffee.
walked back in the freezing cold and finally got my coffee. it's maybe 2am by now.
Suddenly from the corner of my eye i spot an acquaintance. this guy would play at my local each friday, and he also busked in the valley.
-----:88
we tried to see them twice last year and it didn't work out each time .
we got the tickets in October and waited all the way to January to see them.
i thought this year was our year. with retail being busy this time of year, i just didn't even double check the dates of the show.
i would go home and go straight to sleep, then go to the work the next day. rinse and repeat.
i just hid in the fine china stock room after finding out and cried out of stress and frustration for a lot of things. but this pushed me over the edge.
-----:89
i am not racist or prejudice to anyone .
This is the result of something stupid and ridiculous just because it was funny at the time .
-----:90
i'm on new medications that each severely dehydrate me, and during the summer i had no problem downing a bottle of water and peeing every hour or so, but now that school is back in session i'm not able to do that anymore .
didn't really take note of the fact that i hadn't pooped on a couple of days, so when i go to the bathroom for my nightly ablutions and feel that familiar urge, i plop myself down, whip out the phone, and get myself settled in for a satisfying poop .
-----:91
i wanted to shoot some hoops. there was a basketball in the football goal, and i went to get it from the goal.
i kneel down, grab the ball and get back up, only to bang my head really hard against the crossbar.
it hurt really bad, and i was left crying for around 30 minutes.
-----:92
after seeing crank for the first time since it came out i wanted to go ahead and watch the second one.
i didn't get very far when i fell asleep.
everyone clearly heard. and the voice continued in the same tone even though my laptop was shut.
i threw it in my bag but you could still hear it for another 20 seconds untill my computer realized i shut it.
everyone was laughing. this blind girl in front of me was losing it. even the prudes were laughing at me. even the prudes were laughing at me.
-----:93
i've been vegetarian since i was seven & would never hurt any creature on purpose.
i picked up a small pebble (no bigger than a dime) & underhanded it near the crowd of ducks. they must've thought it was food because they all quickly dove for it & came in closer.
we did this for a minute until one of the pebbles actually landed on a duck's butt & bounced off; prompting a tail shake & quick indifference on the duck's part.
i burst out laughing "dude!! you just fucking murdered that duck, you're a fucking dick!
-----:94
my wife and i were at the local wifi spot with some friends when i sent one to my wife pretending to be some dude .
i offer money for a pic in his underwear posted on his wall, and promise a motorcycle if he posts one without anything on at all .
my wife caught on quickly and played along with me acting surprised and bewildered, and laughing at the idea that someone would send such a request .
my wife no longer wants anything to do with this, and says it has gotten past the point of cruelty .
-----:95
i was taking a biology test in class. these are the types of tests that they give you 30 minutes to do, all multiple choice (like 10 simple questions) and you can finish in 5 minutes tops.
 besides handing us out a test booklet and a pencil, we got a periodic table handout (have no fucking idea why we would need this, this is bioucking not chem)
i began to draw magnificent lines and shapes all over my paper. it would have sold for millions if they didn't take it away.
-----:96
my high school was a smaller off shoot of the main high school in my town which i went to because the public high school was wayyy over crowded .
the problem with going to the smaller school is that you get to know everyone in your class, e.g. when i graduated there were at most 20 people all of whom i knew by first and last names on stage getting their diplomas .
this particular day when i was in the jack in the box i asked for plenty of ranch with my stuff, and they obliged with a handful of the stuff .
-----:97
one day my two buddies and i went to go hangout with a couple of girls. they agreed, but wanted to shower first.
a couple of seconds later a young girl and her much younger sister show up to use the bathroom.
i have never in my life heard a little girl make such a noise. it sounded like the [predator](http://slog.thestranger.com/files2008/06/predator.jpg) squeal.
i moved closer to the door and non-chalanty listed for a few seconds and moved away. she was still making the noise.
-----:98
We threw small machetes at each other and parried with our wooden shields .
fortunately, it was small, and only the tip went in. the machete was upright and he didn't bleed *that* much.

obligatory "happened years ago" (when i was in 5th grade, am now out of college)
