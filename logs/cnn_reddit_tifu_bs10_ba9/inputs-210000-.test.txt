so our french teacher asked us to make an interview in french as a proyect, my friends and i made a pretty long video (compared to the other teams) in which i added a lot of memes when i edited it, and also i uploaded it to youtube (http://youtu.be/vy0p71xapms skip to minute 4, the first moments are really boring), then i sended it to our teacher, which had a blast watching it, but my friends and i had fear that we were going to show it to all the class, and that's exactly what happened. we first saw the other videos, which were poorly edited but really funny, but then the moment to watch our video came, and i was the only one of my friends that wanted our video to be watched because i had trust in my work.
what happened next was really akward, the first 4 minutes everyone was bored af, because that's the only serious part, but then shit hits the fan and the memes start to appear, to be honest i was confident that they would at least giggle, then i was horrified because they had a face that subtly said "what the fuck", they laughed only once in a whole 11 minute video, at the end there is an akward silence in the classroom and our teacher only says "well... everyone can have artistic liberty", guess im not doing the graduation video anymore...

sex is messy kids. bring a towel.. 

anyway. 

so i was at my girlfriends house, when we decided we should watch a movie. at the time her parents were not home and we sometimes use their room because they have a better tv and surround sound. so we head in there and pick out a movie. 

everything started well, we were all set and ready with popcorn and etc.. then things start heating up between us. i'm omitting the actual sexy times and skipping to where i fucked up. 

so i'm doing my thang you know. and i feel myself reaching the finish line. it felt nice so i (stupidly) had my eyes closed with my head leaning back. i was into it, don't judge. i pulled out and launched my seedlings onto her back. or so i had thought. the estimated trajectory of my sperm stick was completely miscalculated. i ended up getting a couple of drops on her whilst the rest of my spunk distributed to various other unintended surfaces. up on her parents' pillows, sheets, wall, you name it. it was a mess. 

it was then i realized i had fucked up. i'm sitting there dick in hand just accepting my fate. the sheets could not be changed as that would be obvious, like the stains. so how does one explain those stains to the parents? you don't. you get kicked out of the house and never allowed back.. 

 

edit: i feel like i should clarify some things here. to all saying spill some other form of food or condiment on the sheets and blame it on that: this occurred late at night and they knew we were there with only popcorn. why one would need mayonnaise or something else for popcorn i'm not sure. 

also, her parents were teenagers once too. they know what can go down during movies (especially ones you've already watched). and they were not oblivious to the various stains which were obviously not caused by the popcorn nor drinks we had. 

also: they can smell your cum.

context: was on the bus home from college (uk, im 17) (public bus since we finished early). thats it really...

anyways, its 2nd to last stop and a woman with a pram comes on with the cutest little shit you could imagine. so i know when it comes to the last stop, there is a big enough step down so i know i want to offer a hand with her pram etc. 

so, im trying to figure out how to ask and what to say but i overthink and it by the time i look outside the window we are already here. shit. so me being awkward i say to this women *"you want help lifting **it**?"*

oh my...the glare of pure hatred. just staring into my soul and to make it worse the little bundle of joy makes a funny sound and i just start to laugh and just, oh my. no words could ever be said to describe that look.

so my aunt has a mg midget that has to be from the 1500 series- the black plastic bumpers are a big tell. now, it's got some issues as well. the leather is not in pristine condition, and she said the key is stuck in the ignition. okay, whatever. nbd. she rarely uses it and it sits in her garage. she's told me i can drive it before, but i've never actually done it. so i'm housesitting this week and decided it would be a good time to see if the car even runs (i'm pretty sure she hasn't driven it in over a year, so the gas is probably bad). so i turn the key and the engine won't turn over. no big deal, i figured it wouldn't start. this is where i fucked up.

i thought i might try to look at in the trunk (at this point i was just snooping), but you need the key. so i thought i would try to remove the key (that's supposed to be stuck) from the ignition. it slid out with no problem. and i just knew something was wrong. i looked at the key to make sure nothing was broken, and that's when i saw it. "volvo" written on the key. it was a key for a volvo. she somehow got it in her ignition and got it to start her car. i tried to put it back, it won't go. if it does, it goes in crooked. 

i'm now sitting and panicking not knowing what the hell to do. anyone have experience with mgs and know if this is a common issue? 

my aunt comes back in like 3 days so i've got some time but right now i'm freaking the hell out. anything (serious) helps. 

also, i had another minor fuckup by going to /r/midget (nsfw) before checking to see what the actual subreddit for mg midgets were. it is, in fact, **not** /r/midget.

actually (as usual) this didn’t happen today but about a year ago when csgo gambling was still a big of a thing... so let’s go.

i was casually gambling on a common csgo gambling site. i deposited some skins and they just wouldn’t show up in my inventory on that site... so i typed in the chat that there’s a problem with my deposit. a few minutes later a  ⁇ moderator“ of that gambling site texted me that he would look into my issue... while looking into the issue the system of said site offered me a refund... so far so good usually a normal person would just accept the refund offer and go home... well that’s where the tifu part actually starts.

the mod asked me to add him on skype so we could talk, i called him we talked (as much as i could express myself with my limited capabilities in english as i’m not a native english speaker), i told him that i already received my items back and that everything is fine now... then he told me that he had to exchange the items because they were compromised and gliched out (those were around $50-60 in value). for a moment i thought that this is quite weird and doesn’t sound legit at all but hey as the stupid a** that i am i thought ok let’s do it... we did the trade and after a few minutes he meant that there aren’t any items like mine in the inventory of the bots and that the only way i could recover my value of skins was to give him some of my other skins and he would change the odds of the homepage in a way that i would win a really valuable knife in the next game with a 100% certainty... sounds ridiculous right? 

right! 

but as naive as i was i agreed and went on with the trade... he seemed to actually do something as we had a longer talk. the talk actually was quite nice... ok he made fun of my broken english.. anyways he seemed quite trustworthy... somehow... 
sometimes and the uncertainty in my voice (i was f*cking scared and pretty much knew that i would never see my stuff again) but hey my only option was to wait and see what happens... well any rational mind knows what happened and so it did... after about half an hour of talking one of his buddies joined the conversation and they both yelled:  ⁇ scammed!!“ and they hung of... 

as i said this happened a year ago and i now have some new skins i really but still this shouldn’t have happened...

beware of bastards and your own stupidity xd

so today i was tasked with taking care of my cousins daughter while he my mom and some of her other family members went out to town and got drunk. i had been out the night(no sleep) before and according to the it was only fair. so it all went good but then around 8pm i started to get really sleepy, and laied down. we all know how five year olds can be, so there was no chance of me falling asleep. so, to get rid of her for a what i thought would be ten minutes i asked her if she wanted to play hide and seek. of course she said yes, as any young one would, and i told her to go hide and i would find her... 

here's the fun part. i ended up falling asleep. next thing i know i have my mom, drunk as hell beating me with a flyswatter calling me a dumb goat. it was around 12pm and they had gotten home, all drunk, yelling at me to go get the girl. of course, i was hella confused, and just kinda laied there for a second to figure out what's going on. 

turns out she ran outside, somehow had climbed a tree, a good 13-14 feet and was too scared to climb down. she had been yelling for me for a little less than 4 hours... 

still awaiting punishment

this happened just today (surprise) , and i still feel horrible about it.

around 2 hours before the fuck up i was with my friends after an exam in our free time before a revision session, we went to my friend's (lets say sarah) and played some mortal kombat before we went back to school. with sarah was her friend who i had barely spoken to before, she seemed really nice and i quite liked her. 
fast forward to later at lunch, i was with another person who was also at sarah's house, she suggested it would be funny if she gave me the girls number and we 'prank-texted' her. if anyones interested, [heres the text i sent](http://i.imgur.com/hipgwqa.jpg)

pretty convincing right? a little too convincing apparently as according to sarah who arrived a while after i sent it she had called her father and was close to crying. i managed to bump into the girl at the end of lunch, who insisted i didn't speak to her when i tried to apologise, i felt quite bad.

i to find her after school to find she wasn't as annoyed as before, but i wouldn't describe her as my biggest fan.

so i was inspired by the last post about saying not saying goodnight to my father. 

like most tifu this happened a year ago, i worked with my dad in a very small business which i sort of followed him around since i was little and when i was around 21 and still in college my dad begged me to come home and help him not lose the business, and i did...and sort of sacrificed any sort of personal life goals about my career and what not..but my dad and me went through a lot with a bi-polar manic depressive mother..but that's another subreddit. 


so my entire home got the flu, me, three boys wife, dad, we all lived in the same house, but my dad was diagnosed with mild bronchitis and given antibiotics to treat. a week later he's still not feeling well and decides to tell me then that he hasn't been eating..
(i would bring his dinner plate every night and he had been falling asleep and giving it to the dogs so i wouldn't feel bad he wasn't eating my food)


it's around 2:00pm and i say, we're going to the emergency room now, i took him over and we unfortunately had to wait 8 hours before he was admitted, the nurse checks him out and says it appears to be a small touch of pneumonia.


my father at the time was 66, had been dealing with diabetes type ii for over 15 years and doing very well, worked 5 days a week 8-12 hours a day and no not the healthiest diet but was not overweight. and a few years ago he had been diagnosed with high blood pressure. 


so finally it's around 3:00am my dad tells me go home, be with the grandchildren, go home, cant' sleep, play assassins creed 3 until maybe 6am, wake up at 7am take son to school and on my way home to shower and change my dad calls me


"are you going to work?"
"no i'm going to shower and go to the hospital"
"oh ok, i was really scared you would go to work first"
"no dad...i hate you in the hospital i rather be with you" 


so get to the hospital, and my father and me work, helping him make phone calls, reading and answering e-mails, operational procedures for work...


it's now around 2pm, no doctor has been seen, my dad says he hasn't seen a doctor yet, i'm getting upset and asking the nurse where is the rn or the doctor, she says she can't give me any information because she's just a student helping out. 


my dad urges me to go to work, too many things to do, go to work and then come back. 
"dad promise me you'll call me when you see the doctor" 
"i promise, i love you"
"i love you too." 


i finish up work as fast as possible..but don't make it in time to beat rush hour...around 5:00pm, i wish we could of pushed it to the next flight..was such a small shipment. decide i'm starving, did not eat breakfast or lunch, i'll sit and and eat something. 


gyroville, i love gyros..love lamb since i was little, blame my dad for taking me to miami subs grills when i was 8 and introducing me to the gyro platter, even though the greek salad was my favorite. 


sit down..eat..i even put my tray back on top of the trash and threw my trash out, unlike other animals. 


start driving to the hospital, get a phone call, pick up, hear a lot of noise, but no talking. i keep saying hello 


"is this mia_mal? 
"yes?"
(in the background) "they haven't contacted them yet" 
*click*


my heart sinks..i know it's the hospital, there was still traffic..i'm driving on the shoulder now...and weaving between cars. 


i keep trying to call back, i get hung up on again when i ask for the nurses desk


call back again, finally get someone to help me, put on hold, doctor answers the phone


"i'm sorry, your father passed away" 


his lungs were completely filled with pneumonia. the listed cause of death were complications due to diabetes, high blood pressure and pneumonia. 


my brother had to drag me out of the room around 5am because i didn't want to leave the bedside.

i was making a new chili recipe for my friends, and after i got everything to simmer and chopped the garnishing i had to take a piss.

i should point out that one of the garnishes that i had just chopped was jalape ⁇ os. i was reminded of this when my dick and balls were engulfed in white hot pain. i had an errant scrotal itch. 

i went downstairs to rejoin my friends and nearly collapsed in agony as the full brunt of the jalape ⁇ o holocaust hit me. i ended up pouring a glass of milk and dunking my boys in it to neutralize the capsaicin.

i think my balls are thinking about filing a restraining order against me.

i was in california recently on vacation with my family. obviously while you're there most people go to the beach, my family and i were most people. so we get to the beach and everyone starts getting in the ocean. after about 30 minutes i had the urge to go to the bathroom. 
.
 i get out of the ocean and go to the nearest bathroom. as i'm walking up to it there is a line and trust me when i say, i really had to go. i run and get my towel as if i was to take a shower. i walk back to the bathroom sandles on and towel over my shoulder. i walk in the bathroom and see the stalls don't have doors, which isn't something particularly great for me as i could tell it was going to be.. spicy. so i did what any normal person would do which is go into the shower. i needed to make sure no one would walk in on me so i stayed in there about 5 minutes just to make sure. after the seemingly endless time went by i went over to the drain and squatted down to do my business. all went well, except for one minor detail which should have been apparent before i did this, the water didn't work.
.
 at this point i didn't have many options other than to just walk out as if nothing had happened and hope no one walked in. after about 20 more minutes of being in the ocean i see police cars and crowds of people start to pull up to the bathroom. i didn't think much of it until they stated putting tape around the entire bathroom. turns out the showers were broken and the smell was so bad they thought something died.
.

for those who don't know, melbourne's public transport system uses something called myki. it's kind of a universal ticket system for buses, trains and trams. i keep mine in my wallet, next to my debit card. 

the other thing you need to know is that i'm on a diet. 

i decided i should stop bringing my debit card to school, so i'm not tempted to buy anything from the cafe. i took a card out of my wallet and went to school.

that was on monday, and i've just now realised i've been stealing public transport for about half a week when i looked through my wallet and found my debit card, but not my myki.

ok.. this happened a month ago.. ahh ok well i made eye contact with her at her strip cub yadda yadda yadda she takes me to a private area for dances, i told her i only wanted 3, after my time was up i asked her if she did any off the clock work she said yes then gave me her number, i said fuck it can i have another dance. after that dance while i was paying her (80$)i causally mentioned that that i probably wouldn't call/text because i was a virgin and wasn't properly motivated to pay for that kind of stuff.. she winks then takes my hand and takes me to an even more private area and told me to be quite.. yadda yadda yadda i get laid (actually i wasn't a virgin and she kept telling me i tricked her because i lasted longer then expected). and anyway i go back downstairs tell my friends and leave. now here is where i fucked up.. when i whent to work on monday i told my work friend r what i had done he was cool about it, three days later i tell a another friend s.. who's like 60 and cheats on his wife with desprite girls and hookers so i thought he's was going to be cool too.. but boy was i wrong. i called in sick the next day and when i came in on saturday everyone treated me like normal.. until lunch when another work friend asks if it was true what i did on the weekend i go yea dog and high fived him. him and the 6 other ppl (all different departments) in the room brake out laughing.. then one goes aha i can't believe you fucked your 78 year old grandma's friend. i go fuck that's not what i did.but i don't tell them what actually whent down because there were girls present and its probably even a bigger social stigma. apparently the story that whent around was that i whent up to a strip club in location and left, and then whent to my grandmothers house where she was drinking with some friends and i was so horny from the club i banged one of her friends.. soo fuck right, of course i deny but everyone already knows (including management) so i say fuck it and just started owning it, anyway we all joke about it relitivly openly, they start calling me dirtyn@tedog.. and last week they had a harassment meeting for every employee. mad acward after that for a bit but whatever.. they still call me dnd. my contract ends with them in 15 days and i'm going back to school... aha good times at the car dealership. ohh yea and my dad is friends with the leasing manager.. but he's being cool and told me he won't tell. .

a tifu by letting my little brothers watch wwe

a while back, i was flipping through channels on the tv while my little brothers played soccer in the same room. my brothers are twins and they're 8 years old. looking at the guide, i found something that i hadn't watched in a while and waves of nostalgia flooded over me. i started watching wwe for the first time in years.

this caught my brothers' attention quickly, and they abandoned their soccer game to watch wwe with me while i explained the rules and told them about my favorite wrestlers. they were absolutely captivated. we sat watching the rest of the show, and my brothers loved it and told me they wanted to see more.

about a week after i introduced them to wwe, they began to have wrestling matches just like they have in the show. they even picked their characters and acted like they do in the show! but above all else, my brothers' favorite character is hornswoggle. hornswoggle is one of the wrestlers, with the catch being that he's a dwarf. my brothers found this hilarious and read every legend and story associated with him. you may know where this is going if you're fairly familiar with wwe.

i didn't know this, but hornswoggle's nickname is horny. my brothers, being 8 years old, didn't know the *other* meaning of the word horny, so in their minds they had no reason not to say it.

fast forward to today. i took my brothers to the supermarket, and while we were checking out they had a mini wrestling match in the checkout line. one of my brothers yelled, "i'm the undertaker!" 

the other yelled, "i'm horny!"

the twin who was being hornswoggle tackled the other twin and they went all-out, choke slamming and body slamming. they were on the ground pushing each other around, after one of my little brothers announced to the entire checkout area that he's horny. it took me a few seconds to notice this because i was still handing over cash to the cashier, but immediately after i saw them wrestling i peeled them off of each other. red-faced, i grabbed our groceries and left as the entire checkout area stared at me and gave me dirty looks. when we got to the car, i had to tell them why they can't say that word in public.

this happened lastnight.

i'm a very light sleeper and typically wear ear plugs during the night. lastnight i woke up at approximately 3am needing to go to the bathroom. i go to the bathroom pee and decide i'm also thirsty so i'm going to head to the kitchen and get a drink. i proceed to the kitchen, open fridge, and get a drink of tea. as i'm getting my drink i think i hear something outside, most likely nothing but i'm a little startled since i can't hear so well with my ear plugs in. i don't think much of it, put the tea back in the fridge and head back to bed. as i'm turning the corner to head into the bedroom i see a figure standing in front of me. being a bit jumpy from hearing the noise and then seeing this figure my reaction was to grab whoever it was by the front of their shirt and punch them as hard as i could in the face. it was like slow motion, as my fist was moving forward in the air a small part of my brain was saying "no, don't, that's your fiance" but it was to late. fist connects with face, she starts crying, i start apologizing and asking why she was getting up in the middle of the night (stupid question) she says "i was thirsty you asshole". she is very angry but went and got her drink, and we went back to bed. i feel really bad, her eyes are both black and blue and she has a presentation this week for her class. she is still rather upset about the whole thing.

this literally happened not but 30 minutes ago and i'm still sitting here bashing my head on the table.

there's this girl in one of my history classes, cute girl from my high school but a grade below and we hadn't interacted until this class. well we quickly recognize each other (went to a smallish private high school) talk a bit here and there no more than outside of class, but got along pretty well. so a few weeks ago we become facebook friends and we talk more since. 

fast forward to about 30 mins ago and i'm sitting on facebook and lo and behold she gets on. i wasn't planning on messaging or anything, but i had brought her chat up just to get the heart pumping, you guys know what i'm talking about. well, i hadn't been on facebook in quite a while and i noticed they had some new features, you can attach a file, chat settings, and they added a whole bunch of new emoticons in a separate window. curiosity got the best of me, and i open them up and begin scrolling through. unfortunately for me, i was using my chromebook (acer c720) for all this, and for you who don't know, its touchpad can be extremely sensitive. oh robot face that's funny! and all these cool faces, good job zuckerberg /s. what ends up happening is i tap to click one of the emoticons on accident and facebook has it set up where it automatically sends it! as my luck would have it, it ends up sending this one of all of them http://i.imgur.com/oz19rn5.png... 

i immediately reply "what in the world..." as if i didn't know what happened. as it stands, its now been 28 minutes and no response... i don't have to see her until monday, so i guess i got that going for me, which is nice.

this is kinda weird because i was the one who showed that my dad was color blind.

few years ago when i was a kid, my dad would fetch me from school and take me to his office (he worked as a teacher) where i stayed until he finished his work. to pass the time, i wander around the office and a physiology book got my attention. i loved science books - even college level books pique my interest as long as they have lots of pictures. curious, i picked it up and scanned the pages, hoping to find something interesting.

i managed to stumble across a set of [ishihara plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ishihara_test), diagrams that are used to test for color perception. there were 4 plates and each plates have a number figure in them. 3 of those plates were colored so that a person with color blindness can't see the number figure. i managed to pass the test in all four plates.

i called my dad and showed him the four plates, asking him if he saw the same numbers. he was weirded out. "i only see one plate with a number," he said. "are you sure there are numbers on the others?" 

confused, he showed the pictures to his co-workers. he was like wtf when they told him they saw the numbers. not willing to back down from what he believed he saw, he called a student who managed to be in the office at that time and showed him the same.

the student said "i only see one number from these pictures." pleased that someone else also said the same, my father gloated and said to his co-workers, "see? there's only one number!"

in reply, the student said "sir, i am color-blind."

the office roared with laughter. my dad was indeed color-blind. specifically, he can't see the color red. we still joke about it today and thankfully he's a good sport about it. from time to time though i do forget that he is color-blind, telling him to get the red thingy or the violet thingy or that the red thing or the violet thingy is his like "your toothbrush is violet and mine is blue." 

cue today, while i was mindlessly browsing the net in my room, i saw my dad come in a toothbrush in his mouth and toothpaste all over his face. i was in great shock. my jaw dropped. 

i am very very sure that the toothbrush in his mouth was blue.

it was the same toothbrush i was using for the past six months.

i am not sure anymore if it's his being color-blind or his not giving a fuck about who owns which.

few weeks ago i also caught him using my razor. 

good thing he doesn't know yet that i last used it to shave my pubes.

and i'm back with another subway tifu from china.

chinese subways are typically very crowded during rush hours, so no matter how shaky things get people don't ever fall over because one would just end up leaning against another body. with chinese new year just around the corner some migrant workers are leaving the cities early to return to their hometowns, and as a result the trains can be fairly spacious depending on the time. such was the case last friday when i left work a bit later than usual. the cabin was sparsely populated and there were even a few sets available. i took my usual spot near the far door and put on some music. a few stops later, this gorgeous woman stepped on to the train and decided to stand near me. being a healthy heterosexual male, i couldn't help but check her out. if not for all of her expensive jewelery and designer handbags (she was carrying three, like who does that?), i might have tried to start a conversation. this lady was clearly out of my league, and i turn my attention back to my headphones. a seat opens up and she takes it. i popped a piece of gum in my mouth and dozed off for a while leaning against the door.

after probably ten minutes or so, i saw lady stand up and head for the door. figured this was her stop and my last chance to catch a few more glimpses of her, i kept looking. then train suddenly jerked to an abrupt stop (i swear, chinese drivers, man...), and lady, with her fucking billion inch heels, lost her footing and fell backwards. toward me. of the hundred different actions i could have taken, my brain decided it would be appropriate to follow the corny bullshit that always happens in movies in this scenario. i extended my arm and wrapped it around her shoulders, slowly bring her to a gentle stop (bent my fucking leg too to make it even more dramatic because, fuck me, let me enjoy my moment).

i felt like the smoothest fucking asshole in the whole fucking universe.

lady looked up at me with a startled smile (at least that's what it looked like, if that makes any sense) and thanked me. our faces were not exactly inches apart, but fairly close. and this was where my fucking dumbass brain failed me. i opened my mouth to ask if she was all right. in english. this could have all been avoided if i had lifted her up first or spoken chinese, because to say "are you all right?" in english requires one to go "aaaarrrrr" first. if you recall, i was chewing gum. i opened my mouth and the first thing that came out wasn't a word. it was the gum that i had been chewing. so here i was with a beautiful woman in my arms and going "aaaarrrr" while a piece of chewed gum trailing spit comes tumbling out of my mouth and right into her slightly agape lips. 

now, she was looking up at me in abject terror.

the first thing that crossed my mind is that i should maintain eye contact to assert dominance while asking if she "like(d) that, you retard." (thanks, reddit.) my brain, of course, determined that the only correct response to this absolutely absurd turn of events is to laugh like a fucking maniac. to be fair, it was hilarious. what are the fucking odds of this ever happening? and how the fuck do you respond to it? lady was freaking out and cussing at me, threatening to call security then the cops. by this point, i was on my knees with tears in my eyes and hyperventilating from the laughter. i needed help from the station staff to get back on my feet and off the train. had a chat with the subway security and they all thought it was hilarious, as well. lady was fuming but they convinced her to not involve the cops over something so stupid. she kept yelling "what if he (me) has aids?", which sent me into another minor laughing fit. anyhow, i eventually apologized and watched her stomp off to the opposite platform to catch the train back to her stop. told the story to some friends at the bar later that night and laughed some more.

back story: i'm in a friend zone level 999999 with this one girl. i've come to the conclusion i'm never breaking free, but i sure as hell don't want to make any matters worse for myself. recently i feel like i've been inching out of the friend zone, so i've been trying to flirt and impress her a bit more.


she was flying today, and i personally love airplanes and all things with flying (hoping to start my private pilots license as soon as i can find the extra $10k). i instinctively looked up her flight on flightaware.com, and looked at the flight plan. she was flying into reagan national which is especially interesting to me considering all the restricted airspace around it. i decided to impress her with my findings. i told her at how many feet should would be flying, cruising, what waypoints they would hit, what she could see out her window, and what gate she would be pulling up to. instead of being interested and thinking it was cool like i played in my head, i completely creeped her out. she told me that was boarder line stalkerish, it was weird i knew all that, and frightening that i took the time to look it up. welp, that about shuts that door forever.

last month i had a terrible experience with my 2nd primary care physician (let's call him dr.g) since moving away from my primary of five years. my new insurance doesn't cover him so i only see him sometimes because i have to pay out of pocket. the bad experience happened during my april appointment with dr. g when he didn't show up to work for two hours. i had to wait not only the two hours but another hour for him to see the earlier scheduled patients. he gruffly called me to his office and felt like shit. i almost passed out that morning and my pain level was high. he has been my primary since november of last year. he's not a talker but whatever -- as long as he gets me referrals to my specialists and my meds i'm fine with it. would i prefer an amazing doctor? of course but you can't have everything. 

he asks me why i was on xyz pain medication. he asks this after giving me physical prescriptions of xyz since november and is now just curious? wtf?! why hasn't he read my medical history? why doesn't he know about my multiple surgeries and diagnoses? i'm trying to ask him but he either replies with "right right" or takes phone calls and speaks about other patients in front of me. apparently he gives no fucks about hippa. 

turns out he only requested my medical records once and failed to request them again from my previous doctor or myself. during our first meeting i told him that i have all of my medical records. i asked again if he would like me to bring them next time and he responds while facing his computer saying, "right right." he then takes another call. and i fucking *lost it.* i tell him that he needs to apologize for being late, for taking phone calls in front of me and being uncompassionate. he tells me basically i need to get a new primary care physician because he's only going to give me "basic service." apparently i'm a car in need of an oil change. he gives me my xyz prescription of pain medication and i make calls that day to my insurance company to get a new primary care physician.

on tuesday i call up his office and request my refill and let them know i'm going to be switching primary care physicians per dr. g's suggestion. the office staff says as long as the doctor approves the refill it's fine and to follow up on thursday. i call on thursday and ask if the script will be ready for friday at the location near my house. it will be. great. 

so here is where i fucked up on this past friday:

the woman at the front desk has me sign a copy of the script then gives me the prescription. my name is spelled wrong like it has been for the last five scripts. she tells me that she'll have to have the doctor fix it. this is a lie because she's fixed it every time i've gone there with my name misspelled. then she asks me why i'm not seeing a pain specialist. i'm flabbergasted because it's none of her fucking business. she isn't my nurse or physician. i tell her anyways that the in-group pain specialist doesn't help with my diagnoses and the doctor is aware of this. then she asks what i will be doing next month for my pain. (i've been on xyz medication, stronger doses actually and have worked hard with physical therapy and surgeries to reduce the dosages along with even eliminating two other medications reserved mostly for cancer patients.) being the stupid honest person i am i tell her that i won't be needing dr. g next month because i found a new primary care physician like he told me to. so she stares as me like satan and gloriously rips the prescription from my hand. i reach back for it and she fucking shreds my prescription and tells me because i have a new primary they don't have to treat me. 

holy fuck! i was so fucking angry i told her to get her supervisor immediately. she calls her boss and snottily says what happened thinking her boss would be on her side. she was wrong. the boss says she can have dr. g write me a script for how many days until i see my new doctor. the woman hangs up with chagrin on her face for a few seconds then smugly she tells me that dr. g isn't in yet and they have no idea when he will be in. by this time i'm seeing red and visualizing climbing up over her desk and throttling her. the nurses hear me asking loudly why she was treating me like this and all of them are wide eyed with embarrassment. mind you this woman looks like a meth-head with sores and

tifu rougly 1 hour ago.

i am a very regular person. not too out of the box. i'm very much so straight and had no intention of this happening but seeing as life is a bitch i guess we can't always get what we want.

back story: i love animals. specifically dogs. i was raised with a dog and having one to play with and pet on and love and get love from was a great deal to me. having not been raised in the greatest home, with 4 siblings and myself (i am the youngest), i dealt with a lot of shit from my siblings cause we hadn't had much growing up and i being the youngest had a hard time and just wanted to have a friend to turn to to have fun with like any other child. what better friend than a dog? we had a labrodor retriever who loved us like its own. we would pet on him and even sneak him in to sleep inside.

sad turn of events: jack (the labrodor retriever) had to be put down when i was 9. but we got a new dog soon after named turner. he's a pit-bull/boxer mix and he's a true best friend to this day. when i was 12 we decided to get turner a friend. a little brother if you will. so we got a black mouth curr puppy named tank. these dogs are the best of friends to each other and me.

now on to the fu. a little while ago i took my dogs outside to let them do their business before going to bed. they came back in and i was sitting on the couch and i got up and started petting tank. and since i love the dog so much i do what anyone does and naturally i hug on him and get really close. i start to crouch down and jesus god if there isn't the fireplace rack for the broom thing and the poker and that lovely shit sitting right where my ass was going. let me paint you a picture.

stand up.
pet dog.
crouch to get close.
hanger for fireplace appliances takes your anal virginity and you can no linger call yourself a man.

i sit directly on the son of a bitch. dead center. goes right inbetween and is right at the top of my asshole. i shoot straight up and start screaming like any guy who doesn't want things making a surprise entrance in the back door and my sister starts flipping out. she's like "oh my god what happened?" my response: "i was just assraped by a fireplace hanger."

she proceeded to laugh at my pain and tell me that i was a bitch.
my life consists of mildly unfortunate situations involving some very painful interactions.

hi reddit.

i just made this account to share my horrible experience that i recently had with coca cola. now, i know what you're thinking. "oh, it can't be that bad. you drank some flat coke, so what?" but here's where the problem is: it wasn't simply flat. oh, no, it was much worse.


so about five months ago, my parents went to a neighbor's house. for the purpose of this story, we'll call her ann. ann was a bit weird; she smoked a lotta weed in an illegal state, had a water bed, was in her late sixties, had her house paid off, lived alone. she was nice enough, but my parents never visited her too much. 

one afternoon, she called us over. she invited us to go have some homemade ice-cream. she was a friend of my parents, so she trusted them, and allowed my entire family to go: myself, my mom and dad, my brother, and my sister.

so we arrive; the ice cream isn't done yet. it'll be about an hour. okay, i'll just go run around (this is in a rather rural state, everyone around us has huge amounts of land.) so i was just running around a creek, hitting rotten sticks, and the like.

we wait a little while, and we go and eat the ice cream. so far, so good. then she invited us inside. "oh?" you must be wondering. "is she secretly a horrible pedo-rapist?" the answer is no. she wants us to watch a movie. a movie about the entire usa's power going out for (i think) a week or so. the movie was okay. and before we leave, she says, "oh, take a look at this room here."

she took us to the back room. my parents were leading, then me, then my brother and sister. we open up the door, and there's...

a fuckton of coke, a water purifier, and large generators.

she was trying to get us to become doomsday preppers. 

of course, i wanted to nope the fuck outta there. but my fucking parents were on board with the idea even though we already could hardly pay our bills.

fast forward a bit of time, my parents have purchased about 50 bottles (2 liters) of coke. nothing else. just fucking coke. they've been putting it in my basement. i figure, "hey, no one's gonna need this. it's purely unnecessary, and i like coke. i'm gonna have some o' dis stuff."

so for about three months, i've been slowly draining their supply of coke. however, i've only been getting the bottles out of the front. one day (not today, this was actually two days ago) i decide to get one out of the back, for no particular reason. i go upstairs, open it up, and pour a large glass.

it's flat.

oh, well, i'll drink it anyway. it's still got some sugar in it. i got to drink it.

i feel particles in my mouth.

it tastes foul.

i remember my dad talking to me about five days ago:

"be careful julian, we've been having a rat problem in the basement."

rats.

i was drinking rat shit.

i started to cough up as much as i could, of course, all over my keyboard and mouse.
 

fuck.

i've been having a great time in the class and figured it would be an easy a. and in truth, that's how it's been for the entire term. i figured i was well on my way to becoming a teacher, something i was aspiring to be since my early high school days. 

now if only i knew how to read a bloody calendar.

so here i am, mr. goody-two-shoes all prepped and ready to take my math final on his way to class. when i opened the door, i couldn't help but notice the entire lobby of the college building that was usually full of people was completely empty. that was the first indication something was terribly wrong. i proceed to the testing center and that too is locked. "what the hell?" i thought. so, i make my way through the empty halls to the room where my class usually is and couldn't help but say "what the fuck?" out loud when i noticed the lights in the classroom were out and the door was locked.

i look at the testing schedule taped to the door and realized i truly had fucked up.

when i looked at the calendar, i thought the test was on thursday, the 8th. turns out i overshot by a couple of days and the test was actually on tuesday, the 6th. 

i'm embarrassed beyond belief right now. not only did i miss the test, but also any chance of making it up at this point. i don't even see a point in sending a note o my professor as it would probably be composed of "hey i'm fucking stupid and can't read a calendar."

this happened just now. the smoke alarm has been beeping lately due to low battery, so i finally decided to switch the battery out. i swapped the battery and left the detector to find some ear plugs and test the new battery when the room suddenly started to smell funny. when i picked up the smoke detector, smoke was leaking out from its grille. turned out i had put the 9v battery in the wrong way, overheating the the battery and heating up the circuits inside (that is the explanation for now at least). not sure if ifu or sdfu, but quite ironic, don't you think?

the entire process of this fuck up was captured on snapchat for your enjoyment.

to begin, i have stretched earlobes, 3/4 of an inch in size. i've had them for over 7 years now, but i finally decided to retire them due to wanting to join the military. i had taken my plugs (gauges) out for a week. but i must have insane healing powers, because miraculously they shrunk a tremendous amount, in such a short period of time. i was so blown away by how much they shrunk, that i decided to share a photo to my best buddy on snapchat. after seeing the photo he told me how sad he was about me losing my stretched earlobes, and his reaction kind of made me start missing them too. as well as making me curious as to how much i could actually fit in my ears now. i decided to follow through with that curiosity and push my ear capacity to its limits. 

i started by putting my pinky through the hole, and it fit like a charm. then i moved on to my pointer finger, and with not much effort i managed to stretch it enough to fit the entire thing. at this point i felt that this was my last chance to get my stretched earlobes back to its old size. (it's easier to re-stretch if not to much time has passed) i wasn't really ready to get rid of them, and convinced myself that i could easily get rid of them at any time because of my amazing healing capabilities. "i might as well re-stretch them back now before it's too late!"
 
and so i followed through and tried to jam my old plugs back into my stupid shrunken hole, and i managed to force the fucker back in. i almost immediately regretted that decision due to the amount of pain, redness, and swelling i felt after doing the deed. but regardless, being the idiot that i am, i pressed on and tried to jam the other plug into my other ear! boy that was a mistake, because that other fucker started to fucking bleed! i couldn't fit the other one in no matter how hard i tried. defeated, i decided to give up, and go back to letting my ears shrink and heal. i took out the plug i put in my right ear so i could access the damage, and i couldn't believe just how much i fucked it up. just looking at the last picture in comparison to the first one makes me want to throw up a little. all of the photos were literally taken in the span of about 6-7 minutes. i went from nicely healing ears, to "just fuck my shit up" almost instantaneously. i really hope i didn't just get a blowout and fucked up my ears, and my chances of getting into the military forever.

so this fu happened in october, but whatever. i was in barcelona with my family, celebrating my dads 50th birthday. after a tiring day of following my brothers gf and my mom around on their shoppingspree, we went back to the hotel to rest up at about 15.00. i didn't really get a good breakfast, so i go to buy a snack from the vending machine ( i didn't want to starve before dinner) after carefull consideration, i decide on a tuna sandwich. im swedish, so i'm used to old fish and didn't think it would be a problem. oh how i was wrong. 

i go to town on the sandwich only to stop myself midway through to ask my mom; "hey, is the tuna supposed to be this gray?". my mom glanses at me like im the pickiest little brat in the world, and tells me that "it's ok as long as it smells good." the sandwich doesn't really smell at all, so i ignore it and finish up. later on we go to this nice place that served seafood. i order the calamari (fried squid rings), which usually is delicious, but turn out to taste like eggwhites with the consistensy of rubber. not a pleasant meal, and we go for some drinks before heading back to the hotel. we all say goodnight and go to sleep. 

suddenly i wake up with this tingeling in my stomach, a raised heartbeat, and a salivating mouth. something's wrong, but i just cant figure out what it is. i try to go to sleep, but my dad is snooring like a fucking locomotive, so it's an impossible feat. my heart starts racing, so i get up and go to the bathroom to wash my face. holy shit i'm pale as the motherfucking reaper himself. i have about 0.5 seconds to realise whats wrong before i fill the sink with my stomach-juices. my loud blaaargh-sounds wake my mother, who is now screaming at me not to puke in the sink cause itll clog. too late. i move to the toilet, and suddenly realise that its cascading from both ends. im crouching over the toilet whilst puking in a container, my mom is crying ( probably thought i was dying), and my dad is still snooring louder than thor's thunderstrikes. 

needless to say, i was lying in a tuna-induced stasis for most of the trip.

this was just resolved a few minutes ago. 


so basically, i went to the library to study for my up coming wace exams, when i bumped into one of my closest friends named q. 

q showed me a message he recieved from a girl he had not so recently started talking to, telling about how she had helped my friend g cheat on his girlfriend. this is important, q stressed to me how i couldnt tell anyone. he made me keep it a secret. i think this was because he still didnt know what to do, and didnt want anyone else involved yet. 

g and i arent the closest people, but he is really kind, smart, funny, but above all g is honest. so this idea of him cheating on his girlfriend didn't really sit well with me. 

after tough decision making and a lengthy thought process i went to my closest friend n, completely forgetting q as q and g don't know each other that well. as n is closer to g than i am, it felt right to include her, as i have and will always trust her with my life and deepest darkest secrets, she is that good a friend to me. 

n agrees that the best thing to do would be to talk to g straight up and tell him we heard something scandalous about him. so she does. 

almost immediately q calls me, asking what i did, because now this girl he was messaging had started going off at him. oh shit. i forgot to tell q i was going to tell n and confront g! 

so i had just ruined one of my best friendships by going behind his back and trying to do the right thing by solving an issue before it potentially spread too far. i hope q will forgive me for not keeping his secret, and not telling him i was going to tell n and confront g first. 

there are more details but i dont think theyre necessary to the tifu. if you wanted to know though, this girl had made everything up and lied to q. g hasnt and wouldn't cheat on his girlfriend.

this one happened a couple hours ago. i changed some titles to protect you from nsfl.

so during the "fattening," i was browsing one of the rant threads that mentioned how it didn't make sense that /r/fatpeoplehate was banned and /r/showswithdogs is not. now before this i had no idea this was a subreddit, or that this was a thing that people even did. so i was torn between whether this was to be taken literally or if this was just another inside joke. one thing was certain though, i can't "not" look.

"old dog learns new trick"

after looking through some comments i realize this is not a joke. (this isn't the actual title but it might as well have been.) i'm that guy that slows down passing car accidents due to my morbid curiosity. now i've seen a lot of shit in my 25 years, but i've never seen a dog show. if it exists and it is disgusting, you best believe i gotta see it at least once.

so i click the link. baconreader won't load the link so i have to open it in chrome. after about 100 viruses and popups on my phone, i see a play button over a black box. here we go.

click play...nothing.
click again...still nothing.

i click over and over again but nothing happens. chrome says its playing audio but i hear nothing. must be because i have 2 bars and no 4g. 

"fuck t-mobile"

at this point i'm almost at my therapists office for my counseling group. there's a girl there i'm really into, and i spent an hour last night writing her a poem. i arrive, and the factors of the perfect storm come into play.

1. i live in central jersey and its raining.
2. the building broadcasts free wifi.
3. my gmail app has my work email logged in and my chrome has my personal email, which contains the poem i sent to myself as an attachment.

so i forget all about my quest for in lieu of me spending 2 hours crying about my alcoholism and how its my parents fault i drink and shit like that. it's time for the cigarette break and i know this girl is expecting her poem. she tells me she can't wait to hear it. i know that today is the day she falls head over heels for me.

we are outside smoking in the rain, and i tell her i have something for her. she comes up right beside me. she smells amazing and the mutual attraction is almost tangible. i whip out my phone to open up my work of art and proceed to commit one of the worst fuck ups of my life.

apparently once my phone connected to wifi the video loaded, because there wasn't even a bit of lag as she stared in disgust at the hairy horrorshow i was presenting her. the sound worked too. i wish there was some foreplay, but unfortunately it was right out of the gate. it plays for a few seconds before i rush to smash the back button on my phone. does anyone else's phone get unresponsive when its rained on too much? my shitty kyocera does. i couldn't close it. a good 20 seconds of straight up literal doggy style play before i rip the battery out of my phone.

"you're a fucking freak"

she ran back inside. until the end of group everyone was looking at me like they knew i'm the guy that watches my little pony. i texted her something about as long as this post trying to explain myself, but she hasn't texted me back and probably never will. it's a shame because i thought my poem was really well written.

 

edit: to clarify, the subreddit is not called /r/showswithdogs. replace shows with a synonym for gender and rhymes with chex, and there you have it.

not today, but during my sophomore year of high school, i joined band to get my art credit. one thing that i liked about band was how class was outside when it was warm, which was always a good time.

it is important to note that my sophomore year, i liked to make those beatboxing sounds like scratches and what not, but this one in particular, i would just but my finger over the middle of my lips like i was shushing somebody, and just sucked air in. 

on one occasion that i did this, a bee happened to fly right past me, and i sucked it right into my mouth. i am allergic to bees. it was not a good time.

this happened before i was married... if you see this sweet heart i'm sorry.

alright so i was driving home around 10 at night and i saw a woman on the side on the road hitchhiking. normally i wouldn't notice a hitchhiker but i was in a weird mood and felt like helping. 
i pulled over and asked where she was going. she smiled at me with all her 7 half rotted teeth and said no where anytime soon. unfortunately i didn't ask until she was sitting down. 

let's back things up a bit. at the the time i was 18. i didn't have a job so no money and was coming home from a narcotics anonymous meeting. i had a small pain pill habit that i was just starting to kick. oh and i was driving my mothers mercedes. 

after she said that all i could do was explain my mistake and hope she would just lift her herpes infected butt off my mothers leather seats. nope didn't happen.
she wouldn't leave the car without 40 dollars no matter what and i sure as shit had no money. we were parked on the side of us1 (major road) yelling at each other over 40 dollars. 
finally i had enough. i grabbed her purse and threw it out the window. she retaliated by ripping the keys out of the ignition and booking it down the sidewalk. 

i want you to picture a 5'7 140lb 18 year old white kid and a 6 foot tall 110lb obnoxiously dressed hooker jumping out of an older style black mercedes and running down a main road. 
after what seemed like at least 5 mins of running in circles i got her to stop so i could call a friend for money. 
the hooker and i are standing 20 feet from each other just waiting for my friend to pull up with 40 dollars so i could get my moms keys back and i could go home. 
as soon as my friend pulls up so does 6 cops. it took over an hour to explain my way out of it. the reason they let me go... the hooker ended up telling the truth.

this started two days ago and it followed up today. so we had a new sales guy start at the office. i handle most of the i.t. helpdesk/network admin stuff as well as work in sales (its a private company). i was training him on our systems on his first day and it got to around noon and a little bit past so we went out to lunch. chipotle! we're talking about stuff getting to know each other. people always tend to ask questions about college, family blah blah blah. he asks me if i had any siblings, now this question is always tricky. well, my sister died 7 years ago, and i'm a pretty chill guy so i don't like to bring it up and be the debby downer so i usually do a little white lie. if i have no connection whatsoever back to my real life i say 1, if not i say 2. so i said i have 2, i **was** the middle child growing up, (haven't lied yet). hbu? he goes on saying he has an older sister.. nice dodged a bullet. so i make sure it went off on his topic so i didn't have to lie through my teeth. i hate people feeling sorry for me, compassion isn't really a trait that i have (before or after). 

so fast forward to today when he asks me to go to lunch again today. i try to keep my distance with people who i just meet just so i don't seem like a stage 5 clinger. so i tell him the good place around the area and we go. this is when it gets bad.. he brings back up, "so what do your sisters do" well i say my little sister is going to school in *insert legal pot state here*. and then he asks "oh cool, what does your other sister do" fuck!!! fuck! fuck!! thats what happened for maybe 2 seconds in my head before the monster lie. "yeah, she's an artsy type, she lives downtown" and then changed the topic to something else as fast as i can.

now this doesn't seem that bad, but the kicker is that my dad's the boss.. i need to fix this prior to my dad thinking i'm disillusion and need a psychologist.

obligatory didn't happen today, happened about a month ago.

&nbsp;

my father and i drink quite a bit of water. might be due to our desert upbringing, might not. either way, we always have a full filter pitcher of ice-cold water in the fridge. every time we get a glass, we add more water to the pitcher. that way, we always have a good supply.

&nbsp;

here comes the tifu part.

&nbsp;

my father and i always buy enough meat and poultry to plan out meals for nearly a month. we get the selections home, portion them out into freezer bags, and bring the next choice out of the freezer to thaw as needed. our selection this time was four chicken leg quarters to bake in cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup. i had pulled the package out of the freezer 2 days beforehand and placed it in the fridge. little did i know, but in the act of pulling the chicken out of the freezer, i had ripped a small hole in the packaging.

&nbsp;

so, over the next day and a half, this bag has been dripping chicken blood and juices into, you guessed it, the pour spout of our filter pitcher. it went unnoticed, because it was at the slow rate of maybe a drop every 30 minutes or so. the unfortunate part, was that i got the worst of it. the night before i found the contamination, i had woken up at around 2 am. felt pretty thirsty, so i went to the kitchen for a glass of water. poured myself one, and noticed that the water seemed to be foaming a bit thickly. our fridge light had been burnt out, so i wasn't able to see what was in the pitcher, or my cup, so i shrugged and drank it. i was half asleep, so i didn't really taste anything different.

&nbsp;

fast forward to later on in the morning. i always wake up before my dad, and i'm always thirsty, so once i popped out of bed, i headed to the kitchen for a drink of water. i pulled the door of the fridge open, grabbed the pitcher, and prepared to pour a glass of water...when i noticed something **very** off.

&nbsp;

the water is pinkish, and there is a half an inch thick layer of milky whitish-pink goo at the bottom of the pitcher. i nearly gagged, then immediately dumped the pitcher and proceeded to clean it with scalding hot water and bleach. i cleaned it a total of six times before the salmonella set in, and i was bedridden for over a week. my dad didn't have it as severely, as he had only the mildly contaminated water. he got over it in a week and a half, it took me a month.

back in 6th grade we had a multi-class 3 day field-trip up in the mountains of southern california. it was supposed to be a relatively warm time there, but we were cautioned to bring warm clothes just in case. 

being from california, i hadn't had a lot of interaction with cold weather and snow- meaning sometimes you have to pee really bad when you are in a really warm room and walk outside to a cold snowy area.

the next day the class met at school, jumped in a big long yellow bus and we traveled up to the cabins in the mountains. we were sectioned off to different cabins and then paired off in twos for the buddy system. you were not allowed to leave your buddy, ever.

the first day and night went well. the next morning, however, is where i really messed up. our cabin counselor told us to dress warm because we were all going to go on a hike all together. he also stated, "make sure you go pee before we go on this hike. i'm not stopping no matter what." 

at the time i was completely fine, but as soon as we stepped outside into the foot deep snow, i instantly had to pee. instead of holding everyone up though, i simply kept my mouth shut and started on the trek. 

about 30 minutes into the hike my buddy notices me walking a little funny (i was prancing around trying to hold my bladder in). he asked me what was wrong, but for some reason i wouldn't tell him. 15 minutes later i'm literally grabbing myself and holding while girls in my class are looking at me going, "eww! what is he doing?"

i finally race over to my cabin counselor, yank on his jacket and pull him down to my level, and whisper in his ear, "i really need to pee."

his response was, "i told you to go before we left. i'm not stopping." he simply stood back up and kept the hike moving along.

10 minutes later we finally stop in a big group of about 30 kids and 3 or 4 camp counselors. they had brought a big red handball for a game. they had us all get in a big circle and and told us we were going to play the name game. the person that had the ball would say their name and then throw it to someone else in the circle. that person would have to say the previous person's name and then their name and throw it to someone else. pretty stupid game, but everyone seemed to enjoy it.

at this point, i'm standing in place with my legs scrunched together in that agonized pee pee dance stance. i'm bouncing up and down just waiting for the moment this game is over so i can run over to some bushes and relieve myself. for some reason i hadn't made this decision earlier and now my bladder is literally on the verge of exploding.

apparently one of the girls standing in the circle thought me dancing up and down was a sign i really wanted the red ball. she was thrown the ball, said her name, and then threw the ball to me...

as soon as i saw the ball coming my way i lost concentration on the pee pee dance and focused on catching the ball. as soon as the ball was firmly in my grasp i said her name and began to say mine...but what came out was "ughawwhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

my bladder released and the front of my jeans began to soak through. yellow fluid exited the bottom of my pants onto the clean white snow. i even did that little shiver you sometimes get when it feels so good to pee you can't control your own body movements. man that felt good. i was in a state of euphoria; my head tilted back and my eyes closed.

about 30 seconds later i finished, dropped my head back down and slowly opened my eyes. the majority of the kids in that circle had their jaws open staring at me like i was a little kindergartner. my cabin counselor yanked me out of the circle and asked me what the f*** i was doing. he told me and my buddy that we had to walk back to the cabin with him. was a very embarassing 2 days. luckily it was at the end of the school year so all of the kids had amble time to forget what happened. i never lived it down though...

this fuck up is still currently in progress until i find out my results! 

so i’m a pretty heavy weed smoker, and just recently got a new job which requires a pre employment drug screening. great. they gave me 5 days notice. i’m only small (100lbs but i eat a lot of junk food, but have a high metabolism so i figured i might have a shot at getting clean!) 

so i quit smoking sunday morning and it was the hardest thing i ever had to do. i go down to the local hemp store to find some sort of cleanse kit to flush my system even faster. 

i get down and this dude working is like “dudee, try this super pill, works every time” .. this guy is so stoned, it should have been my first clue. i look into the pill online and ask a few friends, they have used it and it works every time. excellent, this is the quickest option for me at such short notice. the way the pill works; you take it in the morning on an empty stomach, drink an obscene amount of water and then piss clean for a 7-8 hour window. i’m like perfect! i’ll buy two pills, one so i can try it the day before i go. i also get two at home test kits so i can check myself. 

so i get up wednesday morning (the test is on thursday) pop this super pill, drink so much water i nearly vomit (the only think keeping it down was the fact i spent $62 bucks on one pill). wait a bit, i pee on my self test, dirty pee. hmm. didn’t work, wait a bit with more water, pee on the second test, still dirty. at this point i’m freaking out and i remember my roommate has clean piss!!! perfect! i ask her if she’ll piss for me and she’s onboard!

cue to thursday morning. i hear that they test the temperature of your pee so i need to make sure her bottle of piss stays hot from the time she pees into the bottle until the time i get to the place and into pee for myself. so i wrap two hot paws hand warmers around the bottle, because it’s -40 c outside as well. 

she pees into a cup first because the hole on the bottle was so small. so therefore i am trying to get it into the bottle that i’m going to hold between my legs, but i need a funnel to get it in there. i reach and find a canadian tire bill (a local store currency used in canada), funnel it and pour the pee down into the bottle. perfect. i go over to my appointment, pour the pee into the cup, first it started pouring out like glug glug glug, i’m like oh god, that’s not a pee noise, so i have to hold it higher, which in turn causes pee to spill all over me. perfect, filled it to the line, passed it in and she let me leave! i had done it!!

then when i got home i had realized those canadian tire bills i used to funnel the pee into the bottle may have contained traces of cocaine, considering their location of my house, and apparently mythbusters did a study on how 90% of currency contained traces of cocaine? maybe?

now i await my results of my drug test.

 

edit: i passed!!!!!

i work with brass and bullets, we deprime, clean and polish brass and cast bullets. recently(within the last few months) we started working out deals with a company to do decorative stuff and jewelry using the ammo(obviously not live). ex. keychains, magnets, pens, pins, valve stem covers, the list goes on. 

anyway, i was told to drill holes into some .44 mag.([patent pending brass poker](http://i.imgur.com/1nnmvan.jpg)).

it was doing fine before, it's not my first time doing this. for these, you stick the casing on a stick, push it into the metal pipe and hold it. it only goes into the metal pipe enough to get the hole in it, it's held properly. it doesn't move(usually).

i was drilling away, then i came to the casing that almost signed my death warrant. i start drilling, it makes it through the top side and then i don't even know what happened, all i know is that i saw the casing go one way and heard something fly by my ear, between my head and the arm holding the lever of the drill press, and hit the wall behind me.

then i saw the broke [drill bit](http://imgur.com/ofk0gp1.jpg). the other half fell into one of the brass bins and i really didn't feel like looking for it, and i had work to do.

at first i laughed it off and got another drill bit and kept going. but then as the day went on, i kept thinking about it and realized that if it had been a little more to the left or the right, i could've been seriously fucked up. 

here's the [bullet and the half of a drill bit.](http://i.imgur.com/bfuelbc.jpg).

so last night i was incredibly tired but i had a dilemma. i was really craving some gummy bears. so i decided to go buy some. and i told myself that as soon as i got home i was going to eat my gummies in bed and go straight to sleep. 

before i go on i should say that i have this habit of whenever i get home in my room i always throw my wallet in the air and see if i can make it land directly this small tray on my dresser. and i've gotten pretty accurate to! its not the most normal habit to have i know, but it's not dangerous. nothing's close to my night stand that i could damage and my throw is always reasonably accurate. its just turned into a challenge for me. the higher i can throw it, the better. 

anyway, so i came home and tossed the bag of gummies and my phone onto my bed and tossed my wallet at the tray. only...i didn't. *i tossed my wallet on bed and chucked my gummy bears and phone at my tray.* i was soooo tired that after seeing myself toss the wallet on the bed, my body still proceeded to masuchwo more throws for my gummy bears and phone across the room because the weight of the items is different they landed no where close to my tray. the bag of gummies just kinda glided and hit my girlfriend (who was sitting at my desk) on the head. the phone hit my tv square in the middle with a good amount of force and then bounced off the dresser and onto the hardwood face first. my tv wobbled after being hit (so i recently moved and lost 3 of the 4 screws from the tv that held it to the base. so the tv was already wobbly and my phone hitting it was enough force to cause chaos) and fell off the dresser, onto the hardwood right on top of my phone. but it gets worse. as it was falling and the power cord yanked out of the wall, it tripped u a bottle of lemonade that i had which immediately overturned and soiled my ps4. my gf (who had gotten up in fright from all the chaos) just looked at me with big wide eyes. i stood their, trying to process what happened. fortunately i had accidental insurance on my ps4 but my tv and phone are both ruined.
i guess the moral of this story is never buy a bag of gummy bears at 1 in the morning, come home and throw your wallet across your room onto a small tray.

 


edit: okay so a couple of things i wanted to address. 
first off, i think its really stupid how many people are downvoting calling me karma whore etc. check my post history. this is a throwaway. if i cared so much about "internet points," wouldn't i have posted this from a main account? it just doesn't make sense to me that so many people are ready to call out me, this sub etc just because the believe a post is fake. telling me that i must have a camera in this day and age just because everyone else does. i don't frequent this sub, but this is all just kinda of insane to me. anyway i was not gonna do anything but just to shut everyone up, i will post pictures. my dad is coming over to take a look at my stuff and he has a camera. so when he comes i will take pics. i'll describe physical state of things for now. 


phone is completely shattered. tv has what my gf calls "spiders" because that's pretty much what they look like. they are large star looking cracks that cover the screen when it is turned on. my tv still turns on but you can't see anything out of it due to all the cracks. and lastly my ps4 doesn't look to different but it now only turn on in safe mode which doesn't allow you to do anything really. i will take a pic of everything. i also will take a pic of my teeth because everyone's interested in me eating gummy bears and going right to sleep lol.


i promise i was not high. lol i don't even smoke. is it so weird that a grown man has a craving for gummy bears at in the middle of the night?


and lastly the reason my ps4 is insured and not the rest of my devices is because i purchased the insurance on the playstaton store, directly from sony because it was cheap and in my face. i think it was 2 years accidental protection for 60$ or such

i am near sighted, and i can only recognize things by shape and color when i don't have my glasses on. my eyes were pretty dry this morning, so i went to put a few eye drops in. i had forgotten that i had an ear wax dissolvent bottle that looked exactly the same shape and size of my eye drop bottle. i thought i had my eye drop bottle, but i had somehow grabbed the eax wax dissolvent bottle. i put one drop in and felt immediate pain. i rushed to the bathroom and rinsed my eye out for a good 5 minutes, and i took a wet cloth and dabbed my eye every now and than for about an hour. i still have a dull pain in my eye after a few hours, but its nothing i can't handle. it's definitely not the way i wanted to start off my morning.

just before all of this, i've gotta mention that i'm asian. (here we go)

and for this particular scene, i was driving. rather, i *have* been driving like a complete fuck-up. now, just to be clear, i haven't been into the automobile-driving business long- probably about 5 months into it. 

i've just recently learned that i had my high-beam switch perpetually forward, which means that every time, every instance i used my headlights, my high-beams would also turn on. so basically, morning and night. every bloody time i would go out during those hours. 

so for about...i would estimate, 2-months solid, i've been driving like a fuck-up. i'm sorry everyone i blinded. also, i actually didn't know that you're not supposed to leave your high-beams on, in the occasion someone passes you. so i *literally* blinded everyone i passed.

i think i should just ride a scooter instead, now. 

**the good news**- i don't have my high-beams permanently switched on anymore.

let me start by saying that this story is very crazy but i promise, very real. i'm still hungover and trying to figure out what the fuck happened.


last night i went to a party and ended up hooking up with this foreign girl. we came back to my place, had sex and went to sleep.


this morning, i was awaken by my brother calling me (him and i live together). he told me to come outside of the room and then asked me how much did i drink and if i brought a crazy drunk girl over. i was like "yeah, i brought a girl over but she's okay, not crazy." 


then he said: well, she just shat and pissed all over the kitchen floor. i thought he was joking at first... then i went in the kitchen. there was poop under a chair and piss all over the floor.


then the story goes even crazier... he said when he arrived home he saw a naked woman pooping in the kitchen. he shouted asking who the fuck she was, but since she doesn't speak our language, she just didn't say anything and looked crazy. my brother thought she was some lunatic homeless woman and got his paintball gun. he then asked again who she was... and this time she just said my name. then i think he figured out she was with me and pointed her to my room.


so, after hearing this story, i go back inside the room and try to wake her up to no vail. what do i do then? go to the kitchen and disgusted, clean her shit and piss from the floor. 


she woke up not long ago and left. i didn't mention to her the shit (literally) that she did. since we have some friends in common, i don't want her thinking the word will get out. i think i'm gonna go take a bleach shower now.

so this happened 3 days ago, but i didn't have time to write it until now

a little back story before we begin:
so it is that time of the year, and as a newly graduated high school student in the u.s., it was time to go to my college orientation. to all the foreigners out there, orientation is a two day event at the college/university that you will be going to in the fall at which you get to know the place and register for classes and whatnot.

aaaanywas, let's begin. in the fall i will be going to the university of minnesota in the twin cities, which is about 2.5 hours away from where i live. being that orientation starts at 8:15, i had to leave my house at 5:30am to make good time. 
so i go on my merry way and jam to some tunes until i decide it's time for a break and stop at a gas station. i buy a sandwich, a 24oz cup of coffee, and a bottle of water. eat the sandwich. keep driving. 
i continue to listen to music and have a good time, but the closer i get to minneapolis, the heavier the traffic. eventually i came to point where i was only driving about 5mph and stopping frequently. and then it happened. **i had to pee**

at first i thought i could hold it in, but the traffic was so slow and the gps said i still have 30-some minutes before i arrive. so i start to weigh my options. 

after an extra five minutes i look at my empty coffee cup, it looks back. i open the lid. try to some how position my ding dong in a way that will allow me to pee in the cup, but i can't do it while the car is still moving. then, finally, salvation! there's an emergency stop about a mile away. 

now, it's pretty much just an extra piece of road next to the interstate, so no real privacy there, but at least the car wasn't moving.

so i open the cup, wiggle out the pickle, and try to somehow, again, pee in the cup. the "emergency stop" is really close to the road itself, and i can see nearby cars giving me weird looks as i try to position myself for this acrobatic trick. i start peeing and then i discover that the cup is too small for all the gifts i had to bestow on it. so i tr to wrap it up, but then as soon as i lift the cup from underneath my tomahawk, a little extra comes out. all over my shorts. and my car seat. and my legs. 

i cleaned up with some napkins i had but it wasn't pretty.

so this happened a few years ago but still makes me cringe whenever i think about it. 

i used to work as a paramedic in the helicopter division and we had 12 hour night shifts which were usually very quite and we mostly just got paid to sleep.
at 5 o'clock in the morning we get an emergency call from a bakery about an unconscious bakeress. the helicopter takes off with a few minutes delay because of foggy weather. i am hardly awake and quite hungry from getting up early, on the other hand happy about fetching a snack from the bakery when the job is finished.
we touch down on the intersection in front of the shop, which is already secured by police and rush in through the front entrance. i immediately spot the candy jar on the counter and try to take a few. my hand gets stuck in the jar and i am unable the pull it out myself. blushing red i call for my crew, stick my hand under my jacket and we run back to the helicopter to work out this mess. i pour a little lubricant on my hand to smoothen it up, but as so much time has already passed i smash it on the floor behind the pilots seat. now there are broken bits of glass and candy scattered all over the floor. we proceed to clean up, through out the trash and dress the wound on my hand. 

we were lucky that an ambulance arrived in the meantime and was attending the woman inside. luckily she survived but precious time was lost that day.

i eventually quit the job a few months later because i felt the constant pressure made me lose focus whenever i needed it most. am studying to become an engineer now

so this has happened over the span of a couple of months. i worked with this youth group in a particular neighbourhood and knew a lot of the parents. this one lady in particular was always very warm and we would chat often. 

so one day i see her on the bus pushing a stroller with a baby in it (when did she have a baby?) and with the most emphatic smile i can muster up i look her right in the eyes and give her the warmest "hello, how are you doing?". she doesn't respond. even looks disgusted a little bit and i shrink at how cold she's being. stunned, i just kind of take my seat and feel like i was just punched in the face. then i doubt myself, maybe it's not her.

that's fine i can't wait to tell my real friend and have a great laugh over this! a couple of weeks later i get my opportunity, i see her getting on the bus that goes from downtown to our neighbourhood. i approach her with a warm "hi! how are you - shit, fuck, goddammit that's not her". from this woman's face, you would have thought i had crapped on her shoes or something. i just want to disappear as she spits out "do i know you?" with enough venom that i should probably go to the hospital.

i see this doppleganger a third time on the bus, but fool me three times right? no. i see her and i don't even look in her direction. i've beat the evil doppelganger system. a few more weeks pass and me and some friends go to marble slab to get some ice cream. i finally see my friend, my real friend. she's a french canadian with a black husband, 2 daughters and son. my eyes can't fail me this time since i've got multiple confirmations. well you know that nagging feeling you get when you are about to do something and just figure you need to conquer your fears? i got that feeling but i thought i began to doubt myself because of the evil doppelganger. i shut myself up and strut over and with relief exclaim "it's so nice to see you! how have you be- why are they staring at me? when did they get a son? oh sonnnovabitch. they give me the blankest stare and no one says a word. i just stand there awkwardly, realize my idiocy and go and sit with my friends at our own table... 2 tables next to them... the only seat is the one that is facing them so i awkwardly point is so that my breath can't even disperse into their general direction. 

i manage to laugh it off as my wife has now been a witness to 2 of these episodes and i just try to forget their stares. then i really calm down once the family leaves. until the husband comes over and asks me how i know them. his tone was okay but i felt like i could just feel suspicion all over me, oozing out of the man. i asked him if they lived where i know my friends does and told him i mistook his family for a friend's... well i got the neighbourhood close enough that he gave me a look and confirmed that is the area they live and ask if i do summer camps because "we thought we knew you from there". i say i don't and he joins his family and they leave. my friends make me feel worse by speculating as to what the man thinks my intention with his family is.

i want to visit my friend to tell her the story but now i'm afraid that she exists!

i'll start this by telling you a bit about my background :
i'm 27, an it engineer and has been very successful in the dating scene. recently broke up with my 6months gf (she was 24) but it was agreed from both side. wasn't really feeling down or anything and i wanted some break from all the dating stuff just to think about myself a bit.
i also play a really popular game during my free times, called league of legends.
the general population of this game is very young i believe (huge % of underrage players) so i barely talk to the people i don't know because i consider most of its community "too immature".

last week i had a game with this one person, we'll call her carol, with whom i had a really great time. we added each other and soon found out she's a girl, around my age (she said 21) and lives in the same country as me (i'm from europe).
we started playing whenever i came from work and i was surprised she was always home so early but i never questionned it. i just thought to myself she probably lived close to her job so she always got home before me (yea i know dumb assumption this should have been a red flag already).

fast forward to yesterday, we had gotten really close to the point she suddenly asked me if i wanted private pics of her. i said sure why not and she sent me nudes (it was hers cause i saw her on cam btw and she looked youngish). so far so good, i'm really getting along with her and she asks me if i want to play a truth or dare game with her. a bit of a immature game but i say sure why not... it kinda escalated quickly as we were doing mutual masturbation by the end of the night. after we were done and everything, she tells me she really likes me and she has to confess something.
this is where it starts getting creepy, she starts crying and tells me she's been lying about herself, she's not working nor going to school. she just stays home all day and does nothing. i try to calm her down and tell her it's fine, something will probably show up for her in the future and she tells me that i "don't understand".
she then admits being only 14 (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) and that she's quit school for 4-5months now. i really freaked out, i cut the skype call, deleted every logs of conversation i had with her, every pics of her i had, any trace of my link with her and i just went to sleep.
i know what i did is unlawful in a lot of countries but i really didn't know and i feel awful about it. i probably won't be able to trust strangers online anymore after this.

 
ps: sorry for mistakes, english isn't my native language.

edit: she did look around 18-19 but no way i'd say 14 at first glance.

edit 2: she added one of my friend and is trying to lead him on as well, i just warned him and he's still playing along. what should i do? my friend is 22

tifu because i had the hubris to believe that my trusty flash drive i keep on me every second of every day would never jump ship. subsequently this hubris made me lazy and i didn’t back up my files on my flash drive to my computer, or drive, or cloud. i’m a senior in a design college about to graduate in a few months, and i’m currently in my portfolio class where we are meant to composite all our design work and make ourselves marketable. 

well, i got back into town from a trip yesterday and immediately went to the grocery store. in the parking lot my flash drive fell out of my floppy bag. i saw it and put it back in. this was the last time i saw it. i then went to a class building to work on pottery, then to a friend’s house, second friend’s house, then to my house. 

woke up the next day and saw my flash drive wasn’t in my purse, wasn’t in my second purse, wasn’t in my backpack, my car, you name it. i’ve asked around. nothing. but i’m now going to spend the rest of my day looking for it or else there’s going to be no point of being in college.

if i don’t find it, i think i’m going to drop out, move towns, change my name, and life calling. don’t tell me i shouldn’t. 

edit: it was in my bedsheets. i feel stupid but incredibly grateful.

let me just preface by saying that one of my irrational fears is that i will forget to the lock the bathroom door at work, and someone will open it on me mid-stream (i'm a male). i work at a school, so there would be students running around too.

story time:
i was walking around the halls while the students were in class, and i decided to stop at the faculty restroom on my way back to my classroom. the door has a lock on it, and when someone locks it from the inside, a sign says "occupied" on the outside of the door. so i look twice at the door to make sure it does not read "occupied" as i always do. the coast is clear, so i grab the handle and make my way in.

"oh! i'm in here!" - anonymous woman's voice

all that i could muster up was an awkward "oah!" and then i quickly closed the door and ran back to my classroom. she forgot to lock the door. i was on the other end of my irrational fear! i have no idea who was in there, and i hope she didn't see me because that will be some awkward eye contact. i'm also glad the hallway wasn't full of students running about as that would have been much worse. i don't think i will be using the bathroom for the rest of the day. i know this is more of a tifu on her part and not so much mine, but i just feel so awkward and i need to share this story with reddit.

time i f'ed up:
so, when i was in pre-k i became friends with this girl and we ended up going to the same schools up into high school. (while in highschool) one day in drafting class me and my best friend were talking about the girl and i was mentioning how she was beautiful kind etc. 
as the conversation goes on i noticed the people on the other side of the drafting boards where talking about us. we keep talking and suddenly this muscular baseball player starts talking louder so we hear announcing we are talking about his girlfriend. i , thinking i was the badass i am not, inform him i will talk about her if i so choose to. the boyfriend then gets a bit more agitated and threats to fight me. i am by no means capable of fighting anyone. the teacher calms us down and the guys girlfriend peaks her head in the class and tells only me "hey (my name)!" and says nothing to her boyfriend. 

i found out the next day, that guy got some baseball and football players to bully and beat up my best friend. he took it like a man and it has because one of our most told stories. 

 


to anwser comments: yes i made it up to him later, yes the baseball player is spineless, and tbh, i wasnt degrading her in any manner. i was sharing the story about how i knew of her when he overhead. he over reacted.

so, this happened yesterday and i just started recovering from the stupidity of myself. 
 
picture a 22 year old guy who wanted to find a unique present for his mother on the special holiday of mother's day. i didn't want to do the regular flowers, chocolate, and hugs gift. i don't want to be the adam sandler of gift giving. even adam sandler doesn't want to be adam sandler anymore. my mom really likes coffee. like, an obsession with coffee. when i was younger, my dad would get her a coffee gift card and some cups, and occasionally a coffee-maker on her birthday/mother's day. 
 
then i thought of the best idea ever. a coffee mug that is the size of donald trump's ego. 3 feet tall and about 10 inches in diameter. i got to work in my garage, working like an energized umpa loompa that dripped the sweet sweat of passion. this passionate sweat fueled my working until i got what i wanted. a glorious cylinder of pure, caffeinated, bowel-wrecking, goodness. 
 
i ask a friend who works at a coffee store if he can help me fill it up and transport it. for the low cost of $100 he agrees to fill it up and help me transport it.
 
onto the actual mistake. i drive to my mother's house and knock on the door and greet her and talk it up. i excuse myself to grab something from my car, and start moving it up into her house. keep in mind, my mother and father have a house that's main door lands inbetween the two floors. i had to lift it up the stairs once i got inside, with the immolating liquid of satan's diarrhea-inducing wrath in the cup.
 
they just finished up re-carpeting the stairs and downstairs, and my dad must have missed one area of the fourth step. i take a step with the aid of my friend, lifting the prize into the main floor, then it happens.
 
the staples and nails holding in the new carpet come undone and i go flying backwards down the stairs with my friend, and tumbling into the doorway with that liquid from hell falling on friend and i. my parents would've screamed or tried to help, but they were too baffled as to why i was holding a giant coffee cup that looked like whoever owned it would be compensating for something in a big way.
 
i had to go to the er later for some minor burns, and had to take at least three showers to get rid of the smell of a burnt brazilian coffee farmer's ass hairs that protruded around my person.

first things first - i am usually against using herbicides and/or pesticides for home lawncare. last july, however, i needed to fill some cracks in my driveway. the only problem? dandelions were growing in the cracks. so, like any honest son of a pei homeowner, i found an old container of concentrated weedout and went to work.

conveniently, the container had a built-in spray nozzle attached to a tube - no need to tilt it and risk spilling it anywhere. if i'm going to use herbicide, might as well minimize the impact, right? so i happily sprayed each and every dandelion i saw in the driveway. great! there's still half the bottle left for next year! so i put the container on a shelf in the shed, washed my hands, and forgot about it.

today, i opened the shed and looked at the shelf. the nozzle was sitting on the shelf next to the mostly emptied container - fuckfuckfuck - surrounded by a sticky puddle of half-crystallized weed killer. i figured out that the tube had still been full when i put it away - the container acted as a siphon, emptying itself out. now i can look forward to cleaning up some carcinogens tomorrow :|. so much for minimizing spill damage.

this was in chania, crete, on my honeymoon, and we just forgot, it happens. arrived at the airport, they were stunned we forgot, then directed us to a small booth in the back of the airport to print our boarding pass. except they didn't print our boarding passes. first they demanded we pay $100 per person to print our boarding passes. we had no choice. we were furious. really put a cloud over our honeymoon. but then, instead of printing our boarding passes, the lady in the little booth wrote on a piece of paper our names and confirmation number. this was our new boarding pass. thank you ryan air. why stop at $100 per person. i would have paid $200 per person, or even $400 per person. i had no choice. people make mistakes, perhaps mine was flying ryan air in the first place. thank you for preying on innocent victims.

so, as an only child raised by a single mother, i never had a fatherly figure to "show me how to be a man", because of this, i've been plagued by irrational and stupid fears due to getting way too paranoid over everything 

fear #1 kitchen appliances 
after an incident where my house almost exploded and i almost set off a nuke (metal in microwave) i have to leave the room when the kettle or microwave is on, i also get agitated around toasters

fear #2 escalators
during a strange absence of muscle control walking down an escalator i can't go near the bastards without someone i know

fear #3 bugs
after leaving my window open for far too long during an all nighter playing far cry 3, my room was covered in midgies - an annoying bug native to scotland. i cried and slept downstairs until they died

i'm in my mid-30's, and i'm finally realizing that as a society, news-worthy pop culture references from the 1990's are not always understood by the youngest generations. what prompted this realization was a pretty big fu.

i was talking to my 14 y/o niece, who is a high school basketball player. she's going out for varsity this upcoming fall, and they usually only take a handful of underclassmen. she is worried about a girl in her class who's really good at basketball, and while we were talking, she remarked that this girl would likely take the spot she's going for. 

i made a tongue-in-cheek comment to the effect that she should "tonya harding" the other girl. my niece sort of giggled nervously, with a blank look in her eyes. it dawned on me that she had no idea who tonya harding was. i asked "do you know what happened with tonya harding and nancy kerrigan?" she said she had no idea what i was talking about. i was sort of taken aback by the fact that she didn't get my pop culture reference, so i told her to google tonya harding.

well, about 2 hours later, i get a call from her mom. she wants to know why i had my 14-year-old niece google pornography. then it hits me - tonya harding didn't only bash nancy kerrigan's knee (the reference i was talking about), she also made a terrible amateur porn vid that i had forgotten about 15 years ago. apparently my niece had searched "tonya harding video" for some reason. sort of not looking forward to the awkwardness of seeing my niece in the future.

 

for those who aren't familiar, [here's a nice recap of the tonya harding / nancy kerrigan story](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2014/01/02/christine-brennan-tonya-harding-nancy-kerrigan/4294753/).

ok, so this happened quite a while ago, it was one of my first ever job interviews for a low level office job, filing, data input and stuff.

i got to the place where they were interviewing, it was a typical office type building with some stairs leading up to the entrance and reception. now, just outside the main doors was a sign saying "visitors must wear plastic bags on their feet." with 2 boxes underneath, one containing a bunch of rubber bands and the other containing blue plastic bags. "huh." i thought.

the 17 year old me dutifully placed a plastic bag on each foot, secured them with a rubber band, and i was set. i headed in to the office for my interview. 

i spoke to the receptionist and she told me to go down the hallway and take a seat. i did just this, and as i approached the seating area and the other applicants, i noticed that i was the only one wearing the mandatory plastic bags. "i've got this." i thought, "these fools can't even follow simple instructions!".

i watch the practically bare footed hopefuls drift in and out of the interview room until, finally, it's my turn. i enter the room and shake their hands (there were 3 of them).

straight away i registered the amusment on their faces but i shrugged it off. "the sign totally said to wear the bags underthat, you're golden" i kept saying to myself as the interview progressed.

after a few questions the main interviewer stopped me and advised me that there was a building site next door. the construction workers are allowed to use this building's facilities as long as they wear plastic bags on their feet.

this sort of registers with me, but as i'm young, scared and have bags on my feet, i kind of just nod and don't rip off the bags in utter embarassment. after a short silence the interview continues but in a much more sombre fashion. they're now basically intervieiwing someone who, after being told they don't need to wear that stupid mexican sombrero, is still wearing it.

the interview ends, i leave the room and exit the building in a daze. yes, i put the bag and bands back in their respective boxes and no, i didn't get the job. :(

so this fuck up happened about a month ago, but everything came crashing down today.

some background info: my gf and i have been dating for a while, and for a couple reasons (some my fault, some hers) we spent most of the month of july arguing. i was getting really discouraged with the relationship, and one night after a particularly bad fight, i got really drunk and sexted a girl i had been talking to/flirting with about a year ago via the app kik. the next morning i felt like shit, but i told myself it wouldn't happen again, and i didn't tell my gf about it. 

about a week after the incident, we resolved everything and i realized my gf was an amazing woman, and my stubbornness had prevented me from seeing that. since then (mid-july or so) things have been absolutely amazing between us, and i had never been happier. we got to the point where we were talking about marriage, kids, etc, and really thinking about a future together.

fast forward to last night, i went over to her place after working a night shift and she had made me dinner. we had a great night, and before we went to bed i plugged in my phone to charge next to her. the next morning, i wake up to her yelling "what the fuck" and holding my phone in my hand. she had tried to set me a later alarm, but since she's blind as a bat without glasses/contacts, she had accidentally opened up the kik app and came across the messages i had sent to that girl a month ago. 

i tried to explain that it was a drunken mistake, but to no avail. my gf has a super strict moral code about these sorts of things, and she kicked me out of her apartment and hasn't talked to me since. on it's own, this might not have been as bad, but i'll be honest in saying that this is not the first time i've fucked up in this relationship (though it's the first time in my life i've toed the line of infidelity). i'm pretty sure there's no way i'm getting her back at this point.

if anyone has any tips to salvage this relationship, please tell me.

this didn't happen today, but a week ago.

it all started with my job interview, which went pretty great. i really loved the place and i actually thought i got the job. meanwhile, my grandma had her birthday the next day and because she lives in the other city, i thought it would be nice to buy her flowers and take a bus a day earlier, so we could spend more time together.

the bus to the other city was leaving in about an hour, so i decided to go home really quick, change my clothes and then buy the flowers. i left my job interview building, just to discover my public transport bus has stopped on the other side of the road. and of course, my stupid brain is like "run, run, run, you can make it!"

and then i fell.

so much pain. i was just lying on the road, groaning, until some kind man offered his help. he called for an ambulance, it came, and the first question from the doctor was: "was this the last bus?" no. during the time we were waiting for the ambulance, three buses went by.

turned out i have a fracture behind the knee. plaster for the next six weeks. no flowers for my grandma. didn't get the job either. now i'm in pain most of the time, no money, no job. never going to run for the bus again.

throwaway because i don't want my friends to see this and give me shit.



okay so the night started out innocent enough, i got off work, went home, made pizza (loaded it up with pepper flakes), and started catching up on sons of anarchy.
about midway through the show, the new sheriff is shown doing one of those sexy slow walks back to her car and me being a male in my early twenties thought "damn, she's actually pretty fine."

fast-forward to end of the show.
by now i've drank a few beers and am bored as all hell and still a little turned on by sheriff lady so i decide it's time to search some milf porn.

**this is where it all went wrong.**
i open my laptop, load up palimas ( thanks /u/stickleyman ) grab some lotion and lube and get ready to unleash unexpected fury on myself.
my session started out pretty nice, good video, nice stroking motion. but it just wasn't doing it. 
sooooo, i get the bright idea to cover a finger in lube and shove that fucker right on up my ass.

now, the first sign that i should stop was a slight burning sensation(about 45 seconds post finger) . but i being a kinky fucker kinda liked it and shoved that finger even deeper. about 2 mins in the i'm edging and the burning is intensifying. 
not to be swayed i keep going, 3 mins and i feel like someone replaced my finger with a ghost pepper, 3min30secs and i yank the fucker out allow myself to bust and sprint to the bathroom. 

que standing hunched over and spraying out my violated bunghole while thinking of tall the tifu stories about dudes who fingered their gfs after eating mexican food.

** 
ate spicy pizza, masturbated while shoving finger up ass, burnt asshole, still came. then reflected on past tifu stories while washing my anus.

this actually happened last night, but i wasn't in the mood to get on reddit. it probably is important to the story to point out i'm a guy.

so, i have been a member of a small group (think bible study) since june of this year and i love all the people there. it's a group entirely made up of single people between 21-35 yo, so we face may of the same daily and life struggles. bottom line, i really felt like i fit in real well and considered everyone friends.

fast forward to a few weeks ago, one of the girls, let's call her kay, had noticed i act a certain way when i feel like i'm being ignored or excluded from the group. (that's a whole other story, but the short of it is i can't stand it when i'm in a group and no one is talking to me.) so, kay has been encouraging me and trying to help me sort it all out. we have even side hugged as she was leaving group before.

earlier this week, me and kay met up for a beer and she told me that trying to help me had burned her out emotionally and it made me feel awful. as we were leaving, we side hugged.

last night, our group was having a going away party for someone who is moving away for a job. one of our regular attendees (another guy) typically likes to give side hugs to all the girls as they leave. he wasn't there so i took over that role. i even had to run down half way down the stairs to catch 2 of them as they were leaving.

so, kay gets ready to leave, she is standing at the top of the stairs talking to someone. and as soon as they are done, she turns and gets about two steps down before i can get up next to her and she asks, "what are you doing?". as i reach my arm around her, i say, "giving you a side hug!" she acted like it was really awkward, even though it was very brief.

when i got home, i sent her a text, just making chit chat. she responded with this:

"listen you made me super uncomfortable today and have been following me out when i leave group so you could force a hug. i need to separate all conversation because it's affecting me a lot. it's just not ok anymore so need to block your number. i can't be involved in this anymore."

so, out of respect for her, i'm leaving my small group and for the near future, will be avoiding any situation where she might see me (i.e. at church). which sucks because i really liked being in that group and the church as a whole. so, i f'ed up pretty good.

whenever i fall asleep and smell my bed sheets, go to a concert, or simply do my everyday routine, i get turned on whenever i psychologically think that a certain item smells like pussy (or may potentially smell like it). i don't know why, but i greatly enjoy the smell. i sometimes try to imitate the smell by working out, massage my dick, and add some saliva, or pour some distilled white vinegar onto new polyester clothes, but those smells never come close to the ideal smell. 

one day, my girlfriend was visiting and we had dirty talk the whole night. unfortunately, i crashed in my bed before any action occurred. however, the next day, after she took a shower, she left without bringing her worn panties with her. i actually never smelled panties before, so i decided why not. i had a whiff and wow i had an intense boner. later that night, i would smell it again. however, that day was also a long day so i crashed in the bed, but with her panties around my head and the cloth wrapped around my nose. i think it was pretty pleasant, but when i woke up, something weird happened. i can't smell the pussy anymore. i thought i was dreaming, or probably had the smell desensitized in my nose, so i put away the panties and did my morning routine. an hour later, i grabbed some bacon and eggs for breakfast, but i realized i could not smell the bacon at all. interesting. 

my instinct hinted that something bad happened to my nose, so i went to a doctor. he mentioned that there was some infection in my nose, which permanently damaged the inside of my nose, so i guess i lost the sense of smell due to being too overly kinky and obsessive with smelling pussy.

 

edit: i think it was improperly implied, but it took 3 weeks for my smell to remotely even be recovered, but then, my sense of smell was a lot lot worse than before

hey reddit!

so i've been traveling in africa for a while, now. about four days ago, i got reeally sick. i was puking all day, had diarrhea, stomach aches... it really sucked. nothing seemed to help. 

fast forward to today and still i haven't left my hotel room for more than 20 minutes at a time since i got sick. i was feeling better, but really faint because i hadn't eaten. i had a light breakfast and decided that i was going to go to the beach. i know that a lot of places here don't have washrooms, so i chose wisely and went to a beach front bar where i was 100% certain that they had a bathroom.

so i'm on the beach, tanning, drinking water, reading... when all of a sudden, i need to shit *now*. so i get up and hobble over to the washroom with my butt muscles tensed up as to not leak liquid shit everywhere.

*"lady! lady! sorry, the bathroom's getting repaired right now, you can't go in,"* the bartender explains. *"what no it's ok i'll use it anyways!" "umm, no you can't, there's someone fixing it."*

i was desperate, and i told him it was an emergency, and he laughed it off saying, *"just go in the ocean, everyone does."* turns out the closest bathroom was a 7-10 minute walk away...

so get into the water and start swimming out as fast as i can. i get about twice as far as the second furthest person... i look around. no boats, no surfers, no swimmers... ok. 

i pull down my bathing suit and start to let out a massive load of orange pudding-like shit. it creates this disgusting cloud... and half started floating up, so i swim a few meters away with my bottoms still down.

then... i look down into the water and see there's four fucking scuba divers about 2 meters below me, completely grossed out, pointing at my cloud of diarrhea to warn each other and swimming away as fast as they could. i shit on scuba divers. 

i left the beach immediately and now i'm back at my hotel.

oh god why.

this happend just a few minutes ago, im just sitting on a bench listening to some comedians making jokes (with headphones on and volume high up), suddenly they say an really funny joke and i almost laugh. meanwhile i am trying to hold my laugh in this old lady, easely in her 75-80 years rolls up to me in a wheelchair and wants to ask me something, i look up at her and rip one of my in-ear headphones out, letting the other one stay in. 

guess what happened, just guess. i hear another fucking hillarious joke, i almost double over from this while this old lady looks really hurt and sad. she rolls on to another street and i am just sitting there.

i dont realise what i have done untill like 5 seconds after she is gone, i grab my things and run off too embarased.

was in the 5th grade when this happened.

my crush name’s started with an o, so i’ll call her oprah.

i printed some porn from googling “wallpaper nudes.” i printed like 15 pages of that stuff and hid them in my sock drawer or in my books. one day, my mother came in abruptly while my porno was out and i immediately hid them in one of my school books. for whatever reason oprah, who never visits me (she’s not even a friend but my mother knew hers), needed to borrow a book to do her schoolwork.

my mother stomps to my desk and grabs the book with all the goodies. i never felt so terrified in my life and some of the papers fell out but they were face-down so nothing was exposed yet. all i could say was “h-hey mom i still need that book!” usually my mother actually does what i say when i’m upset like that, and i think she would’ve gave me the book back, but oprah already reached for it, and sure enough the dirty pics were exposed.

one of the pics had a busty babe being drilled by this gorilla of a man, another of nikki nova, and another pic was of a pornstar named anette dawn, who was wearing nothing but her shoes.

oprah replied with “ewwwww,” and stormed out. my mother brought out some chopsticks and started whipping my ass for being the little pervert i am.

it was really hard to hide my porn after that for the next few years, especially dial-up internet alerted everyone i was on the computer.

oprah didn’t really act different from before, but once i caught her saying to a friend that i was nasty and that i was kind of ugly.

so this story is from my teen years as many of the posts here.

for the story to make sense, i should first describe some facts about my country. i live in istanbul -turkey and there is a rather interesting type of public transport here called "minibus". basically it is a small bus that goes on a planned route but doesn't have specific stations. you signal to it like a taxi and it picks you up, when you want to get out you tell the driver and he stops. this type of transportation is common in crowded cities such as istanbul which has a population of more than 20 millions packed in a small land. this is also one of the reasons why traffic is a mess and minibus drivers are especially known for driving dangerously. the more rounds they make during the day the more people they carry, so they tend to be very fast at their stops, giving you barely enough time to jump in or out. 

anyways, it was a very hot summer weekend around 13 years ago when i was 16. it was also around the time when i barely held back from jerking off to anything and everything i've seen. i was completely under control of my hormones and my battle-worn dick. i don't remember very well but i had some errands to do on the other side of the city (i lived in european side and i had to cross istanbul bosphorus to go on asian side) so i decided to catch a ferry. i put on the best looking outfits according to my 16 years old brain and left the house feeling like eros. i hopped on a minibus to catch the next ferry but because of a miscalculation i noticed i already missed it. i was thinking about how hot the weather was and how pointless it was to sweat in the minibus when i noticed two incredibly beautiful girls in horizon, walking on the sidewalk next to us. then i came up with a genius plan: i was gonna get out right in front of the girls in such a way that they were gonna fall in love with this human image of a god right then and there. just before the minibus caught up to the girls, i shouted the driver to stop and he opened the doors before the minibus stopped, just as i expected. the operation was a go:


i held by the steel rod of the automatic door and leaned towards outside, looking directly at the girls. just as we were passing by them i jumped up in the air with a sexy hip twist. i flew like an eagle for a few seconds, blinking and smiling at all the lesser beings who were admiring my athletic feats. then right in front of the girls i smoothly landed on the ground like a feather. all the spotligths were on me right there. the girls couldn’t process what they were seeing for a second and i didn’t blame them for beeing overwhelmed under so much sexyness. then they jumped on me, kissing me everywhere and whispering “fuck me, fuck me!!” to my ears. ...well... that’s how it should have happened but life doesn’t always bring what we want right?


i held by the steel rod of the automatic door and leaned towards outside, looking directly at the girls. just as we were passing by them i jumped up in the air with a sexy hip twist. i flew like an eagle for a few seconds, blinking and smiling at all the lesser beings who were admiring my athletic feats. then right in front of the girls i hit the ground like a wrecking ball hitting a building. i was not expecting such a hard landing so i couldn’t let go of the rod. the driver tought i got out already so instead of coming to a halt he started accelerating which caused my already unbalanced body to bounce like a gazelle. i let go of the rod by reflex after noticing my step length was like 10 meters and faceplanted to the sidewalk with all my might. i would like to say that everything ended there but i was surprised back then also when i bounced back to my feet and started running again. i owe a thank you for that to momentum. needless to say i tumbled and fell again in just a few seconds. to this day i can still vaguely hear the laughters of the girls and minibus passengers when i go to sleep.

this just happened a couple hours ago.
it's early into the evening almost 9pm and i'm studying at school for my midterms. i get a text from my friend saying she was headed home and could give me a ride since i lived along the way. so i pack my things and walk out the building towards the parking lot.

so here's where the fuck-up begins. i live in toronto, canada and it just so happens to be a -20 degree with -30 degree celcius windchill kind of night. i just wanted to get into a warm car so i could feel my toes again. as i approach the parking lot i see a white car resembling that of my friend's with its headlights on, so i think to myself, *oh she must have been waiting for a couple minutes now, better hurry it up.* i quicken my pace and make it to the passenger door of the car. i noticed that there was seat cover draped over the passenger seat that i didn't recall ever being there. i ignore this observation because i was freezing and desperate for warmth. *the rest of the car cabin was not lit but i knew someone was inside.* 

so i pull on the door handle excited by the prospect of warmth. the lights come on as i open the door and i noticed immediately all the little toys and car accessories in the car. so the alarm bells went off in my head and i realized this wasn't my friend's car. i look up slightly and the driver who's also female looks up at me and asks, "*tim?"* i was caught off guard and just muttered "oh shit, i'm sorry, wrong car...." i quickly slam the door and turn around trying to find my friend's car nearby. low and behold my friend's car was parked two spots over.......

i'm just glad the unsuspecting driver didn't freak out on me as i was all bundled up in my black jacket, a toque and wearing [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/415vjioolsl.jpg) only leaving eyes exposed. the best part is the stranger drove an acura tsx, the exactly the same as my friend's car...........

so til i learned cars look very similar at night time so i best be more observant before climbing into one.

obligatory this didn't actually happen today, but a few weeks ago.

i was going out for an event with my friends in the evening and realised i had a couple of sachets of kool-aid. i decided to make a bottle of the stuff to bring with me. seeing an unopened bottle of fizzy water, i thought i may as well use it to make the kool-aid - it would save me using a bowl or a pitcher to make the drink, and i'd never tried kool-aid fizzy, so i thought it was worth a try.

i tore open one of the sachets, opened the bottle of fizzy water, and poured the whole satchet in. crossing the kitchen to get something to mix the powder with, i heard a fizzing sound. i looked back, horrified, as i watched a column of bright red liquid spewing from the top of the bottle. i ran back to the bottle to transfer it to the sink, but it was too late - in my efforts to contain the fountain of undiluted kool-aid, i'd got the stuff _everywhere_!

it's worth noting that my kitchen units are made of light-coloured wood, and the floor is white tiling. this stuff doesn't really stand up to red food dye. i frantically ran to get some kitchen roll and bleach (to clean the surfaces, i didn't want to drink _quite_ yet) and spent literally the next two hours cleaning the bright red food dye which, by this point, had managed to spread out across the entire kitchen.

two hours, a bottle of bleach, and a bin bag full of kitchen roll later, i stood looking at what was left of my bottle of kool-aid. a surprising amount of the fizzy water was left - almost half the bottle - but nearly all of the powder ended up being ejected in the volcanic eruption of two hours earlier. slightly traumatised and with hands dyed bright red (i couldn't get the colour off them for the rest of the week), i poured the bottle down the sink.

i still occasionally find spots of kool-aid i missed weeks ago, and if you look closely at some of the kitchen units and floor, there are very faint pink spots still there!

i've been a lurker for quite some time and never had anything to really say. my fuck up happened early this morning and things have just calmed down enough that i now have time to type this.

i was doing some work up in a mechanical room of a hospital. an easy set up and removal of insulation, or so i thought. sitting on a duct, finishing removal when a piece of insulation got wrapped around a valve without me knowing.

i had no idea the valve was there, nor was it tagged or locked off. but needless to say, i ended up with gallons upon gallons of water gushing out over this duct. i had thought i broke the pipe and found my boss who was able to help me locate it and shut it off. 

this has never happened to me before and i totally panicked.

i thought i would have been fired, but that wasn't the case. first time for everything i guess.

 

til: always question shut off valves. 

hope you enjoyed my first entry. don't do what i did.

update: turns out we all get over time due to the flooding. series of unfortunate events.

edit: spelled a word wrong. changed a letter.

i got up early today, and cleaned the bathroom, including the vanity and counter. i shoved everything onto the edge of the bath tub, with the intention of putting it back after breakfast. 


cue my husband waking up, and stumbling into the bathroom to splash his face with water, brush his teeth, and comb his hair. 


then i hear: "hey, sweetie, did you get different toothpaste? this tastes really weird". 


....


i go into the bathroom to see that he has squeezed white paste out of the anti fungal cream tube, and our colgate is still sitting on the tub. he was not amused.

this fuck up happened a long time ago but after watching the gta sa real life parody it hit me like a train. back when gta san andreas came out i was around 13-14 years old and managed to get my hands on a copy of the game. in the game you're allowed to take photos with the camera and save them on your memory card. being a young man discovering his sex drive i quickly ended up using the camera to take a bunch of rather explicit photos (some upskirts & boobs) saving them on my memory card. i probably spent 5 minutes doing this before getting back to missions and regular gta stuff.

fast forward a couple weeks and my family is having a get together at the house. many of our family friends come by and with them their kids who are around my age. since i'm the only one of us that has gta everyone wants to play it so we do and i'm feeling like hot shit. (the kids are upstairs playing gta while the adults are doing whatever downstairs). as fate would have it the next mission we play requires us to use the camera. the kid on the controller has never done it before so he practices using it. this is when i start to remember those photos i took from before and the room starts getting unbearably hot. he ends up going to the saved photos and up on the big screen tv is all the pictures i took weeks earlier. complete silence fell over the room of about 6 other kids. luckily the kid on the controller must have felt my awkwardness because he exited the camera screen after a couple seconds and kept playing like nothing happened.

this is a short fuck up that has happened to me today and i can still feel it, here's the fuck up:
as usual i woke up at 7am and started getting ready for school - washing my face, brushing my teeth etc. after that i went to the kitchen and got my self a cup of tea and a bun with poppy seeds. it was quite a nice morning, but after eating the bun i felt i there were dozens of the poppy seeds stuck between my teeth and i didn't have much time left to brush my teeth again so i threw a piece of gum into my mouth and went out. the distance between my home and my school is around 1 km so it didn't take me long to get there and as i entered the school i remembered that chewing gum is forbidden inside the school so i swallowed it (the gum had a super strong mint taste) and thought nothing of it.
i got back home at around 8pm because my friends wanted to go to the city center to buy some stuff and i think i could've gotten home later if it wasn't for the urge to take a dump. when i got home i rushed to the toilet and released all that was within but i got a strange feeling... i would describe it as if someone was spilling liquid hydrogen on my butt crack. it was freezing. it was the gum. it came out.

i was nineteen, in college, and dating this incredible woman. we had talked on the internet for a year before she came to the same college i was attending. we hit it off right away. she was gorgeous. still is. we're talking selma hayek type of beauty here. not super-over-the-top-glam but she was hispanic and it was great from day one.

fast forward several months and we are nearing the end of our first year together. we are sharing a dormroom-suite area with my best friend and his girlfriend at the time, so we actually have some privacy and that leads to some rather interesting conversations. like the one i find out that she's highly bisexual and has had flings with her friends back in high school. nineteen year old me thinks this is just the fucking best news ever, but i try to approach it kind of cool. i don't ask her too much, but i do let slip that it would be really hot to see her with another woman.

after that night, i listen to her talking to one of her high school friends that is going to college in the next state over. it's in spanish, so i can pick up some words, but i can't get the whole gist of it, and i'm certainly not fluent in the slang. after a few phone calls, she tells me that she wants me to take her to a city between our college and her friend's college and rent a hotel room for a weekend.

fuckin right.

so i do, and it happens to be the city where my best friend and his girlfriend are from, so we ride back with them and go to the hotel. weird thing is, the hotel name was the same as my first name, which isn't a common name. weird. so we wait for her friend to show up, and she does. what follows is a three-day romp through the pleasures of sex i never knew existed to that point. there was very little internet back then, certainly no porn websites like now. the hardest thing i had seen was a hustler and maybe some cinemax after dark. it was glorious. i don't know how many orgasms i had, but by the third day, i was nearly delirious and drunk with sex. never thought it could happen, but it did. then, i fucked it up.

laying in the middle of the bed, with one arm around each woman, who were in turn, cuddled up to my side, my dick-thinking brain let out, "i wish i could marry both of you."

yeah, it went downhill from there fast.

additional note. on the way back to my college, i had the worst stomach ache of my life. turned out it was appendicitis.

so i should preface this by saying this happened a week ago. 

i had chinese food for dinner the previous night, and i figured i could eat it for breakfast when i woke up the next morning. instead of just popping the corner of [the container](http://elingreso.com/wp-content/uploads/mint_in_plastic_container_from_chinese_restaurant.jpg), or pouring it into a bowl, or any other number of ways to reheat chinese food, i thought i'd poke a hole in the top to vent the steam. step one of my fuck-up is complete.

begin phase two of my complete fuck-up. i pull one of the sharpest knives we have out of the drawer. i pick up the container. can you see where this is going? if you have ever tried to do this before, you'd know how rigid the plastic on those containers is. i take the knife, and press it into the plastic while it's in my hand. i keep going, thinking i'd be able to stop the knife from going through the second half of the plastic. proceed to stage three of my monumental fuckup. the knife rams through the plastic, and through the nice soft fleshy part of my palm.

long story short, got to the hospital, didn't hit my bones, missed my nerves as well. went to the orthopedic center, and i cut my tendon 2/3rds. i'm now enjoying the wonderful world of hurt my own body can put on me for being such a dumbass.

so like many tifu's, this didn't happen today, it was actually a few years ago when i was in college. i wound up having the absolute worst foot-in-mouth experiences of my life, and to one of the nicest guys. i still feel terrible to this day.

there was a guy who had been a part of my incoming freshman class. he was a really nice guy, very smart, very polite and dignified, witty, and charming (no homo). he was known for being impeccably dressed and having his hair neatly combed. he always looked professional, which made him stand out as this was college. however he wasn't pretentious or condescending, he was very nice to everyone and really popular. he stayed away from frat parties and might roll his eyes at an especially vulgar or dumb joke, but he was really nice to everyone and always up for an intelligent or witty joke. he went to a nice southern private school in high school and i think that's where he learned to be so professional.

i'm a child of midwestern public schools. bluntness and directness were more my style, i didn't care about appearances, and my humor is much more self-deprecating. so he and i weren't particularly close but it was a small college and we both were in somewhat similar circles. we both enjoyed philosophical discussions and would share funny youtube video's, he had a great sense of humor (we both liked puns and family guy) and we were able to bond over that, and he and i often sat at the same table in the dining hall during meals.

however, during our junior year, his mom apparently got very sick. he took a leave of absence to be with her. eventually, i learned through the grape vine, that she passed away.

he returned to our school a year later, restarting his junior year while me and the rest of our class were in our senior year. due to his maturity, he had actually been closest with people in the classes ahead of us. he had been gone for our entire junior year, so he hadn't met any of the freshman from the previous year and had missed out on bonding with us and the previous year's sophmores. 

now our school was pretty small so we all heard about the situation with his mom. we knew coming back would be hard. so everyone reached out to him and tried to be as welcoming and supportive as we could. 

the way he preferred to handle things, he didn't really talk about what happened to his mom. at least not to me or most people. in my experience this is normal, people who have had especially difficult experiences don't like to relive it and want to just be treated the same as everyone else. 

so he came back to school to make something of a new start. i had joined a new fraternity the previous year, and we decided to invite him to join. he accepted, and soon, he was our brother.

i began spending more time with him than i had before, andi got to know him much better. we bonded over the usual things, funny jokes, puns, and silly youtube videos or tv shows. we both liked clever humor and puns in particular, and both like somewhat dark, morbid humor as well. family guy was one of our favorite topics. he had this funny quirk where if he laughed really hard, his face would turn red. most people's faces will turn red if they laugh hard enough but for him, it was easier than most. so i would always try to make him laugh so hard his face turned red.

one day, we were eating together in the dining hall. it was me, him, and several of our friends just having the usual talks about our classes, professors, social drama, the usual. eventually we start sharing funny things we heard or saw. i jump in with what i thought was a hilarious joke i saw on family guy.

on the show, one of the characters references lou gehrig's disease. then in the flashback, they show lou gehrig laughing maniacally in a lab having just finished designing a deadly disease that he will henceforth call, "lou gehrig's disease." but then he slips and accidentally injects himself with it. the joke is that instead of the disease being named for lou gehrig because he is one of the first people to catch it, (which is why it really has that name) lou gehrig was actually an evil mad scientist who had created the disease on purpose. so a good guy everyone loves is actually a villain everyone should despise.

i finished telling the story and waited for everyone to laugh.

silence. deafening silence.

now i had told my share of failed jokes before, but this was different. this time, everyone seemed really uncomfortable. no one would say anything.

so i start

so, this happened last summer when i was going on a family vacation,and we needed to take the plane. we had bought business-class tickets, because my grandfather was sick and we wanted to change the time of departure if something bad had happened to him. so, there we are getting through security, and because we had business-class tickets we went in a very quick line('cause that's one of the plusses with business clas) and we are amazingly quickly at the end of security and my handbag is the last one through. this is where i fucked up.note: i am a juggler and i enjoy juggling with knives too. there i am waiting, standing with my brother and i say casually "well, that was easy!" pretty loud. that's when this security guy comes along and says "are there any sharp items in your bag sir?" and "are you in the possesion of a butterly knife?". startled as i am i say "yearh,but it's at home" and then he pulls out my balisong from the bag and i look like a giant question mark. then i remember that i must have forgotten it in the bag, from last time was out practicing. so i had to fill out all these forms and talk to the police and everuthing and got out with fine. luckily, thanks to this good-guy policeman who had heard my story, teared the fine apart and threw the knife away.

lesson: always remember to check your bag for stuff that could get you into problems before traveling by plane.

as with many tifu's this did not actually happen today it was a few weeks ago. it all started when my boyfriend decided to trust me with the password to his phone, i decided to play with it a bit while he was asleep and wanted to see some of the pictures he had taken of us together. i opened his gallery to find pictures and videos of him with other women, now i knew he had had a decent amount of ex girlfriends and hadn't deleted anything on his phone recently but being a stereotypical woman i overreacted and decided to go through his messages to see who those women were and what they meant to him only to find that during the first 3 months of our relationship he had been avidly flirting with multiple women and even going so far as to ask one of them for pictures of her breasts. i felt bad about going through his personal messages but confronted him about it, it nearly lead to us breaking up...it still might become the reason of our eventual breakup. i had decided in the end to forgive him for it under the condition that he delete all the photos, videos, text messages and even some of the contacts. one week later: going through his phone again because at this point i think i have every right to be skeptical i find that he still hasn't deleted the content i asked him to so i wake him up and force him to delete it all while i'm watching him to ensure he does. today i found a photo of his ex girlfriend in his wallet. i'm trying to make the relationship work despite my lack of trust because i love him but it seems like it may not work if i keep finding things our relationship is going through quite a bit of tension but i still love him to pieces.

i'll be using a throwaway b/c school. 

**backstory:**i'm a senior in highschool. never had a girlfriend or ever been that close w/ the opposite gender aside from like 1 friend and family. i'm internally terrified of being any social situation in front of anyone. this fear is intensified w/ bigger groups.

so it's going to be senior year and i feel like challenging myself in the last year both physically and mentally. in my school there are several types of gym classes. i take a class more intense than what i'm use to. i never work out and i am unfit. not in the way that i can't sit up, but in the way in that i can't do anything physically demanding w/o being worn out quickly. from what i've hear this class has more girls than males usually. i'm already on the edge about it, but i know a few friends that are in it. so i think to myself, "what are the chances of being in this w/o a single person i know." so i take the class hoping to get better physically and feel a bit better about myself. so school started this week, i go to my gym class. there aren't many people there yet, so i think maybe people are late. the teacher of this class goes up to me and says, "oh, hi (name), it's nice to see you in this class. but just so you know, you are the only guy in this class." as i hear these words, i almost had died of stress. and since i can't change my classes w/o paying and/or taking out classes i need. i'm stuck here for 2 semesters. i want out bad, i'm in a class that i know no one and being the only guy. i can barely interact w/ people of my own gender, this is hell incarnate for me. surrounded by people that i feel are judging everything i do, and being in gym. the only reason i'm planning on staying in this class is: raise my fitness level & maybe if i'm dropped in the worst situation for my social phobia maybe it would go away. if my social fear becomes unbearable i'm planning on just shelling out 50bucks to get the hell out.

this happened 45 minutes ago

so i ordered a tamron 18-200mm lens for my camera nikon d5200 and i thought i would test it out on some star shots. so i mount my camera with the lens to a tripod out on my driveway, i figure i'm going to be out there a while so i should pull up a chair. as i walk to my garage i see a cooler on wheels, so i say "eh good enough for me". this is the fu, as i sit down on the cooler behind my tripod, it rolls out from under me, and my legs flail in the air and knock my tripod over. crash down goes the camera and my new lens. now there are scratches on it and when i shake it rattling occurs, i will just have to see what happens.

**[ 


mandatory "actually happened years ago". we're gonna tell this story from a variety of different perspectives, because i honestly believe that's the best way to hear it and usually when i tell it my buddy ricky is there to tell his part.

8:30 - myself and two friends we'll call kevin and sylar have just finished eating at a chinese buffet. we're high school age teens, we're bored, there's a walmart in the same shopping center across the parking lot.

8:35 - ricky gets a call, it's sylar, "hey man, you want to come meet kevin, pyronius, and i at walmart. we're just hanging out." he's in.

8:40 - the manager of walmart who we'll call manny is having a rough day, there have been a lot of thefts lately and he's having to reprimand one of his employees. to make matters worse three retarded looking high school boys are headed his way and they clearly want to ask him something.

"hey man, do you have any megaphones?"

no, he sighs, they don't carry megaphones. no, no ping-pong balls either. they wander off into the store and he goes back to yelling at horatio for being such a fuckup.

8:45 - i've just spotted a suitcase and my head is brimming with ideas.

8:48 - manny passes by the shoe aisle. one of those jackass kids is towards the back giving furtive glances around the store, but he can't see the others. somethings up with them. fucking assholes.

8:53 - laronda is doing her weekly shopping. she doesn't mind it. it gives her a chance to get away from the house and the kids, and most of all gregory. he's not a bad guy, but it was a mistake marrying him after pierre died. she likes to take this time to think, reflect on the art career she was forced to abandon so suddenly. she's considering getting back into it. as she reaches into the freezer to grab a gallon of ice cream she thinks about what she would paint if she were to start painting again. a duck maybe? she'd always liked ducks. her thoughts are interrupted by an unexpected hissing sound, followed by a cackling laugh. she glances around, but the only other people near her are two teenage boys lugging a suitcase around for some reason.

"fools!" shouts the suitcase as she stares at it, "you know not with whom you interfere! release me now or suffer my curse."

walmart... fucking walmart. laronda decides that next time she'll go to target.

9:00 - back in the shoe aisle i fall out the suitcase giggling. "how many did we get? five? alright. gimme a minute to breathe, then i'll get back in and we can head to the front of the store where there'll be more people."

9:03 - manny watches from behind a clothing rack as the boys from earlier drag a suitcase towards the front of the store. they're still looking around suspiciously. he begins to approach them.

9:03 - "shit shit shit!" the suitcase whisper screams. "back to the shoe aisle! it's the manager, we have to go!" but sylar knows there's no time. they'll have to duck into whatever hidden space is closest.

9:04 - manny is on his radio: "yeah, three teenage boys, high school age, wearing shorts."

9:05 - ricky is pulling into the parking lot when a sudden commotion begins at the front of the store. pyronius, sylar, and kevin come sprinting out with the manager hot in pursuit yelling for them to stop. the cop parked outside the store turns on his lights and peels out after them. ricky parks his car and lights a cigarette to watch the show.

9:05.5 - halfway back to the car we realize the lights behind us aren't just some jackass speeding through the lot. "oh fuck guys, stop. it's the cops."

9:05.75 - why do they run? why do they always run? thinks officer gargantious as jumps out of his car. "hands up motherfuckers!" he yells. he likes that word. it's his favorite word. he's always been a big fan of samuel l. jackson. "get your motherfucking hands on the motherfucking car!" big fan. one of the boys hesitates, he seems confused.

9:06 - ricky smiles as the cop reaches to his hip and pulls out a crackling taser. the blue sparks light

(this happened a few months ago.)

it was one of those days that just started badly, i don't want to go into the full day story, only what started my bad day. you see i live in an apartment, that has underground parking and outside lot parking. in order to park in the lot, you have to be a resident of the complex and have a parking placard, if you don't you either need to park in the visitor designated parking area, or on the street. if you park in the underground parking, the parking placard is not really necessary, since you pay for the protected parking. usually i park in the underground, and have been for years. how ever there was some maintenance work being done to the underground parking area, so i was forced to park outside for a week or so. the one day, i went to work, and did some errands, how ever i took down the placard hanging from my rear view mirror so i could drive without it distracting me, and put it on the little shelf above my glove compartment. i got home after running errands, parked in the lot, and thought i put the placard back up. 

the next morning, when i was leaving for work, i noticed my truck is gone. i panicked for a bit, thinking someone stole my truck, but then i ended up remembering about the placard. my truck was towed. that is the consequence if you do not have a parking sticker and are parked in the wrong area of the lot. i ended up going to the main office to get the number of the towing company that my complex has, and i find out they did tow it. i ended up walking a little over a mile in the pouring rain and paying a bit of money to get my truck out of the impound and was 45 minutes late for work. fortunately for me i have an understanding boss. i was cussing myself out a massive blue streak. not a good start to the day. i forgot to put the placard back up. fortunately i learned from that costly mistake.

 

[edit] i changed a word. i cannot brain today.

i posted this recently in an askreddit thread but was told by someone to share it here. this happened a while ago while in school. it was my sophomore year of college. i had been partying with friends and returned to my dorm/suite to pass out. i was quite drunk and i called a fwb for a late night booty call. shortly after i called her i passed out in my bed. i woke up in the morning with a severe hang over and a rumbly in my tumbly. i was sleeping on my side in my shitty little dorm room twin bed and let loose with a massive alcohol powered rotten machine gun fart. i felt some odd reverberations however, and it was at that point i realized i wasn't alone in my bed. my friend had come over and when i didn't answer the door she climbed in through my ground floor window and unbeknownst to me proceeded to get into my bed. those reverberations i was feeling was my fart vibrating off this poor girl's bare belly while she spooned me. the explosion woke her up and i heard a confused "wha-? whazzit?" as her half asleep mind tried to process what just happened and why she was so abrubtly woken up. then the smell hit. it was awful. i heard her gasp and gag but there was no escape. i'm a big guy (6'0) and she was a small asian girl trapped between the wall and my ass. as she continued to retch i closed my eyes in shame and pretended to be fast asleep. we never spoke of this event but it was seared in my mind, and surely hers as well.

younger kid has been asking for a basketball hoop for a while, so i finally bit the bullet and got one. 54" board, 10 feet high - the whole deal. in this model the pole extends forward at an angle, so you don't slam into it when you are trying to dunk a ball. as a result, the assembly is kind of tipsy without the weight in the base.

got so excited after finally assembling it and eager to try, i only partially filled the base with water while figuring out the best place to put it on a driveway (it's heavy as fuck to roll around).

saturday was fun and games, and today was easter, so i totally forgot to fully fill the base. rain storm came in the afternoon with wind gusts, and the whole fucking thing came crashing down right onto my wife's car straight through the windshield.

ffffuuu. that's $450 out of the pocket for starters, but the worst part is, the earliest appointment at the glass shop is in two weeks. will be calling them in the morning to see if they have any cancellations so i get the car in.

wife is upset, i feel like a complete retard, which i am.

obligatory "this happened 13-14 years ago intro."

i was about 9-10 years old and had just gone away for the weekend for my first youth group retreat. two points that are important... i have always been a big kid/guy, and i have a shy bowel making it hard to use a bathroom anywhere that there are a lot of people.

we get on the road for a 4-5 hour trip to our destination, a group of large cabin-style buildings on a lake. it was quickly discovered by my bunk-mates and leaders that the door to the bathroom on our cabin of about a dozen boys/leaders didn't lock. when i heard this i wasn't too concerned seeing as most bathrooms are somewhat small and have the toilet near the door so i figured i could just push the door closed if anyone tried to enter (and lets face it, a bunch of elementary school boys are going to think it's hilarious to barge in on someone using the bathroom, and i saw it happen to someone else with my own eyes within the first hour of settling in). the bathroom was set up in a way that the door was aligned with the walkway between the rows of bunks.

i was quickly horrified to find out, when i finally looked inside, to see that this was **not** a normal bathroom. it was unusually large and the toilet was several steps in, *straight in from the door with no inside coverage should someone decide to barge in*. i told myself i could make it the 4 days/3 nights until we went home without using the bathroom to shit, planning on pissing every day in the lake during swim time.

now here is another factor that adds to my idiotic fuckup. as i mentioned i am a big guy, and when i found out you could go back in the food line to get as many seconds, thirds, and so on as you wanted so long as there was food left i proceeded to abuse this privilege for every meal, always taking at least seconds, sometimes even thirds and once (for an ***amazing*** biscuits and gravy breakfast) fourths.

i am somewhat oddly proud of the fact that i had made it a few days without shitting, but i could feel the pressure building and eventually even letting go enough to piss was making me feel like i was about to shit at the same time. on the third day, after lunch, it was free swim time so i headed to the lake for my daily piss. it was at this moment my body decided to retaliate in full force. i was just about to start pissing in the water when i felt this excruciating pain in my gut and i just *knew i* ***had*** *to shit*. i knew that this time i was not going to be able to piss without losing full bowel control so i considered just attempting to shit in the water as well but as a young boy just starting to become interested in girls, there were way too many girls swimming around me to even really consider it.

then (and for some reason only then and not earlier) it dawned on my young mind that during free time the cabin would undoubtedly be clear of anyone since people would be at the lake or playing other games and i decided to run back to finally shit in that shitty bathroom.

i made it to the bathroom and nervously pulled down my swim trunks and sat down, expecting it to basically come out like a cannonball from a cannon, fast and loud. but nothing happened... my gut was still having painful spasms to the point i was nearly crying, my life basically flashing before my eyes, me vowing to never go to another youth retreat after this. i realized that with all my overeating and not having had a single shit in close to 70 hours i must be incredibly backed up.

the pain was so bad in my gut that i basically forgot i had had to piss, so i hadn't tucked the little guy in (you know everyone pees when they poop) and just pushed my bowels as hard as i could. it was so large and solid that it hurt my asshole as it got stretched out, feeling like i was going to split in half. then... **immense** satisfaction (as well as an intense spike of pain) as i finally successfully broke through and started letting it out... at that exact moment my free willy pissed so hard that it shot across that stupidly large floor space and hit the opposite wall, in basically a straight line with no arc, with such force that piss started spraying everywhere. i didn't care. my body was so happy to be free of that pain that i just sat on the toilet for several minutes after just recovering.

after recovering i realized what i mess i had made with the piss and i knew i had to clean it up. queue another fuckup. i just started taking toilet paper and wiping down every surface that i even thought my piss had contaminated and then proceeded to throw the tp in the toilet

so, a couple days ago, i went snowboarding with a couple buddies at a local mountain. we were breaking for lunch at the lodge and i decided to grab a tasty/expensive drink from the bar. it became apparent that i wasn't the only one with this plan, as the line stretched from inside to out the door and into the cold. 
as i took my place in line, i notice the cute girl standing directly in front of me and alone in line. awesome. well, i'm a relatively quiet guy and def not your average pick-up artist, but i start a conversation. things are going well and she seems somewhat interested in me. 

we've made it inside now and are near ordering our drinks. that's when one dude and three girls come over to our place in line. with a smirk on his face, i immediately get the impression that he seems like kind of a cocky douche. anyway, he says to me "hey bro, let us get drinks on you, and we'll pay cash for your beer." obviously, i understood that he was trying to work out a deal to hop in line, however his phrasing matched with the fact that i'm not very trusting of seemingly shady assholes put me in a bit of a skeptic vibe. i looked over to the girl to see what she thought about who was already nodding and seeming very enthusiastic about it. i even look to the person behind me to see if he'd been listening and to see if it looks like he'd be fussy about me taking the deal. he had been listening, but kinda shrugs at me like go for it. i think 'fuck it' and say to him "sure, might as well".

so now we're at the front, and as they begin ordering drinks, i start to rack my brain over what is gonna take place. like i said, the dude seemed a little sketch, so i start wondering if he's gonna expect me to put this on my credit card. if he does, i can safely assume this is some kind of scam and i'll have to think of something to say to go back on my word about doing it. so i keep overthinking this as i order my drink, and i don't realize until later that i had failed to hear the guy ask this girl i had just met what drink she wants, so that he can buy her one too. he goes to order said drink, but before doing so, looks at me and says, "cause yeah you guys are together right?" thinking he was just making small talk and asking if we were dating, i respond adamantly "oh.. no, no we aren't," so she doesn't feel awkward about the question. he gives me a funny look and says "oh.. ok". and then proceeds to pull out cash and pay for all our drinks but without ordering the one for her. i still did not realize what had happened, so i grab my free drink, happy that i was not being tricked after all, turned to her, smiled, and said 'well that worked out'. 

i only realized what had happened after walking away and having noticed that the girl's glance shifted from adoration before, to looking at me like i'm the biggest asshole on the face of the planet, after.

throwaway because my friend goes on reddit.

so a few months ago im at my friends house and let me just preface this by saying that he is pretty rich, his living room is about as big as my entire house and his mother is a real-estate agent.

so we're there and i make a cheeky comment about how my mom has had some trouble making rent at some points being a single mother and such and raising me and my little brother. mostly it was a joke, i said it after seeing their built in hot-tub/shower and was kind of trying to comment on how different out life's were.

anyways a few minutes later she pulls me into the next room and asks me if everything is alright at home, to which i reply "yeah fine everythings fine" she said thats good and i left thinking nothing of it

well today she shows up at my door and hands me an envelope and says "its no big deal but i dont want your mom to worry this christmas" she tells me to give it to my mom and leaves.

so i open it and find 300$

now look i live in a suburb of detroit so 300$ is quite a lot of money to people aorund here, when my friend's family did live around here they were easily some of the richest people in town.

so what should i do reddit? we dont need the 300$ but its certainly nice. should i give it back? tell her the truth? id love to hear your opinions'

about 3 weeks ago, i got a job at a grocery store as a stock boy. i was so happy that i could start saving up and buying more expensive things (like a goddamn ps4). so i go in today and it's completely normal. everything's fine until about 8:30 when my manager says he wants to talk to me in the office. so i follow him to the office, we both sit down, and he says that they have to let me go. i asked what he meant by "let me go." we were slow so i figured i could just leave early. nope. just a polite way of saying you're fired (apparently doesn't go on your record but not the point). i asked what i did wrong and he said that i was being too slow and not interacting with customers enough. he then said that i could go home early if i wanted but i just decided to work my last 30 minutes. but here's the thing: no one ever told me i was doing anything wrong. how the hell am i supposed to know that i'm not being good enough when you don't tell me? they even scheduled me to work next week. hell, i thought i was doing my job pretty well honestly. i tried helping customers the best i could, i did whatever they told me to do, and i was even going about the same speed as my coworkers. i don't even know why i worked that last 30 minutes. i was mostly standing around but i even put the shopping carts away when they told me to. i'm going to see if they can give me a second chance tomorrow because i really felt like i was doing a way better job than they thought i was. at the very least i earned enough money to buy a ps4.

so many of you may know the outcome of this story just by reading the title.

**backstory**
>yesterday, i decided to while at my local gas station to pick up some gum. i had a nostalgia moment and picked up some bubble tape gum. oh the joy...

fast forward to today, while at work today my friend stops in my office and we start talking about plans for the weekend. while doing this i actually start working on something important for my boss, so i start to ignore my friend. (i know i'm a terrible friend) my friend sees my gum on my desk and asks if he can have some. not caring i tell him sure and continue working.

he places the gum back down closed and says he will talk to me later about making plans. i saw sure and continue working.

later that day i decide i want some gum so i grab my hubba bubba and open it...

**there is a huge bite right in the middle of my hubba bubba tape.**

i thought people only did this on 4chan or reddit for people to rage, not to actually do it to someone. idk if he and i can be friends anymore...

contrary to most stories here, this one actually did happen today! i go a different college, but i'm home for spring break this week. last night, i went to a friend's dorm to drink beer and pretend to be irish for a day. at some point, i blacked out for about an hour. apparently, i decided i was going to bed and stripped down to my boxers. my friend went to his girlfriends room, leaving me asleep in bed. 

i wake up in the bathroom, wearing just my boxers, having puked in the sink. blacked out me did not prop the door open, so i have no way of getting back into the room. all his roommates are gone, and my friend is the only one in this building with a key. 

unfortunately for me, the elevators require a key to get to any other floor, and i don't even know which floor he's on. i decide to go into the stairwell to try and get to another floor, and the door locks behind me. every other door is locked, and eventually i end up standing outside the building in my boxers. someone lets me into the building, but the campus police stop me before i can get into the elevator. luckily, standing outside in your boxers tends to sober you up a bit so i don't think they knew i was 20 minute past blacking out. 

they find my friend, knock on the door - mid-sex, for them - and he comes to the lobby, tells me i'm a massive dumbass, and gets me back into his room.

so this just happened

so i was with my parents in the living room discussing my future vehicle (both of them are sobber during this part but just began to pound down shots). after about 30 minutes, it is kicking in, and they are arguing about being fat, and who's more fat (odd argument i guess, but hey sounds kinda funny!). well it changes quickly into a past sex life of theirs, now that should have been the point in time where i just noped the fuck on out of there, but i didn't. well they continue to talk about it, father says he's unhappy about their non existent sex life blah blah blah. i'm browsing reddit during this just barely listening in, i hear my father yell "i miss the girl that would fuck like crazy in the bathroom after work with me, and would piss all over me before sex!". well my mother gasps, freaks out and can't believe what she had just heard. i laugh. my father is mad because he's still being serious about his argument... i have weird parents.

i recently starting hooking up with a girl i knew from high school. we are 22 now, and just realized we were a decent match.

it was our 5th (or so) night of sleeping together, and it was great. semi-buzzed sex ending in mutual satisfaction. as morning rolled around, we decided to have another go. things progressed normally, foreplay went well, and eventually we ended up with her on top. as she was on top, being incredibly sexy and making me realize i had landed something special, i decided to try and assert my male dominance. mistake.

i thought a slap on the ass would be just perfect. not too hard, but enough to get the message across. i'm a stud. as i swing my arm out to start building momentum, she sits straight up on me. my arm moves around and i start the slight whip-like motion so that it i get a nice "pop" as my hand lands.

i start to make contact. my palm lands directly in the middle of her butt cheek. my fingertips, fully extended, wrap around, only to find that i've overshot the runway (so to speak). my stomach drops, and my mouth starts salivating.

i slapped my balls. hard. with the aforementioned pop.

i let out an audible groan, and she immediately knew what i had done. she tried to get off out of courtesy, but in my state, all i could mutter was "don't move. don't move."

i sat there for the next 5 minutes, inside her, trying not to vomit (successfully) and her trying not to laugh (unsuccessfully). 

after what felt like a lifetime, i was able to allow her to get off (not the way i had hoped).

i was in my language arts class last thursday and we had to do an essay, but i finished early so i decided to take a nap, unfortunately that peaceful nap turned into a rape filled nightmare. the dream started with me walking down a road and a man following me, i noticed so i started walking faster, so did he. so i started running, so did he. it turned into an all out sprint and i just couldn't run fast enough. he caught me and violently pulled my pants down, pulled out his dick, and was ready for my asshole. right as he put his cock in my ass i woke up and screamed the loudest scream i think i've ever produced in my life. i knew all eyes we're on me and i just couldn't muster up the courage to look around. my teacher holding back her laughter asks if i'm ok and i reply with the weakest "yes" i could find. everyone kept laughing at me the rest of the day and now i'm known as the guy who screams in his sleep. i don't even know how the fuck i'm going to live down, now i'm afraid to fall asleep in any of my classes.

throwaway because this is one of the dumbest /most fucked up things i have ever done. also wasn't today, happened about 6 years ago.

with professional googling skills and an impeccable lack of common sense, 13-year-old me one day discovered that peppermint extract is up to 90% pure alcohol. it wasn't long before me and my pre-pubescent cronies skated our douchey asses straight to safeway (where we would always hang out anyways, for some reason) to get our hands on this irresistible new elixir. let me just say that peppermint extract is beyond any reasonable doubt the most unenjoyable substance i have ever consumed. imagine satan looking you straight in the eye as he plunges 6 packs of altoids down your throat, only before spewing half a can of bear mace directly into your esophagus. that didn't stop us though, obviously, and eventually we ran into some problems.

after about a week of experimenting with extract, we were pretty used to the process of obtaining it. we would just walk into safeway, roll over to the aisle (which was right next to the exit), grab 4 or 5 bottles, and walk out. easy. we would then proceed to sit directly outside of the entrance, open and drink them at our leisure, and then leave all of the garbage right there on the table when we left. to this day i have absolutely no idea how we were never caught for this. anyways, on one day i got dropped off at safeway and met a couple of my friends who were at the usual table, sipping the usual toxic bullshit we had been stealing for the last 2 weeks or so. this time however, this girl was there, let's call her jenna. now jenna was a true champion in this moment, because just as i was walking up, she was in the process of proving that she could drink an entire bottle of mint extract in one shot without even wincing. we were all stunned. of course, the first response was something along the lines of "nooo way, do it again." and she did. this girl was fucking invincible! how much more could she do? we had to know.

keep in the back of your mind from this point on that jenna was expected to be home in a number of hours, as she needed to attend her little sister's 8th birthday party. for some reason, this was the last thing on our minds, and so we pushed her to take another. this one took a little convincing. jenna was carrying a bag of pistachios from the store, which we immediately began threatening to take away unless she took another. she kept saying that we knew she could if she wanted to, but that wasn't enough for us. one of my friends began slowly pouring out the pistachios onto the ground as we walked while holding a sealed bottle out with the other hand. at this point, if i'm honest, she still clearly kind of wanted to show off, and so she took it. she didn't care about the nuts, we stole them anyways, and it wasn't until the 4th shot where things started to get pretty fucked up.

allow me to preface this next section with the fact that my friends and i were also a drunk at this point, but that does nothing to excuse what happened. before shot 4, shit started to get real weird. one of my buddies went full rape mode for a sec, and had jenna down to just her bathing suit (i have no idea why she was wearing a bathing suit). keep in mind that this is next to a baseball field in a relatively public area in the middle of the fucking day. she was rather hopelessly resisting as my friend fully stripped her of her top. i know it should have happened way sooner, but this is when i temporarily dropped a fat n o p e all over the situation. i played the "you can't fucking do that here, look where we are" card, and got at least some of her clothes back on. it seems like that's where it should have ended, but for some reason all 3 of us just entirely lacked any sort of moral compass. god knows why, but we wanted her to take another. i don't even remember what was said, but it doesn't really matter. after about 2 minutes, i slumped over to the sidelines while my friends persisted to force yet another bottle of mint extract on her. of course, she drank it.
this was really the point of no return. for the next hour or so, jenna went full ragdoll on us. she couldn't stand or walk, and couldn't say anything that made any real sense. the worst part is that it was all just a complete joke to us. we thought it was so fucking funny that this was happening. there was just some indescribable sense of "i can't believe what we're doing right now" as we carried this completely black

well, this happened about two weeks ago. but anway, i went out to get coffee at about 1am, because why not. i was quickly informed that it was cash only. so i trekked down to the shop to get cash out, and ended up talking to the cashier for about 40 minutes about his whole life story. it was pretty interesting, but then i really wanted my coffee. walked back in the freezing cold and finally got my coffee. it's maybe 2am by now. i start my drive home, but pull over 15 minutes later as i need to check my phone. then suddenly from the corner of my eye i spot an acquaintance. this guy would play at my local each friday, and he also busked in the valley. i'd seen him around, spoken to him before, and we also had mutual friends, so i assumed he was a chill guy. we had a good chat and he invited me over to smoke, i said yes. anyway, so we're having a great conversation, smoked a bit, played cards, and it was all completely platonic. there was no strange sexual energy, no flirting, nothing out of the ordinary. just two casual friends hanging out. then he begins to prep for bed. dims the lights. gets under the covers. all over the space of 30 minutes i'd say. so i'm talking about the birth of my child, and my labour (because we both have kids, and that was the subject of our conversation), and hear this faint rustling sound. i look over and he's actually wanking. he's wanking. having a tug. spanking the monkey, etcetera. i freaked the fuck out, but didn't let him catch on that i knew. i calmly said that i had to go because i had work in the morning. he orginally had his back to me, but he rolls over, continues to tug, looks me in the eye, smiles, and says "yeah, no worries". i legged it. i eventually messaged him later to say that his behaviour wasn't cool, and he said that i should've locked the door on the way out, and that he apologises for his nocturnal reflexes and that next time i can sit on the floor. cheers.

my boyfriend's mom bought me tickets to the trans siberian orchestra show for my birthday. she spent roughly $150 on them so my we could go see them. my boyfriend and i were so pumped to see the show. i always wanted to see them since i was a kid. heavy metal christmas music just sounded so cool to 7 year old me and still does to 23 year old me. 




 we tried to see them twice last year and it didn't work out each time. the first time i drove to meet my boyfriend at the concert. we lived in different areas back then because i was away at college. we met in the city that was smack in middle of us. however, he was late. extremely late. i had his ticket so i had to wait outside in the cold and give it to him so he could be let in. he got stuck in really bad traffic and had no idea how long he'd take so i waited outside all the way through the concert. 




 he bought me tickets for tso for christmas that year to make up for the previous attempt. we had to travel a state away to see them this time. wouldn't you know it, a huge snowstorm caused us to abandon our journey half way there because the roads were too dangerous. 



 now this brings us to today. we got the tickets in october and waited all the way to january to see them. i was very excited. it was also my last day of work at my retail job before i focused to study solely for the gmat for two months. i thought it was a great way to end my time there. leave my last day and head straight to see tso.




 i get a call from my boyfriend while at work. he says, "we fucked up. it was yesterday." i just lose it. i thought this year was our year. with retail being busy this time of year, i just didn't even double check the dates of the show. i would go home and go straight to sleep, then go to the work the next day. rinse and repeat. i just hid in the fine china stock room after finding out and cried out of stress and frustration for a lot of things. but this pushed me over the edge. i even got special permission to leave work early to see the concert. 




so this may be an annual fuck up.

so just to clarify, i am not racist. this situation is the result of doing something stupid and ridiculous just because it sounded funny at the time. again, i am not racist or prejudice to anyone. 

so i'm in psychology class playing plague inc on my phone, trying out the new dawn of the planet of the apes simian flu virus type. i open it up, add my gene types (modifiers for the progress of virus), and i have to think of a name. i'm horrible with names so i'm sitting there thinking hard. 

my black friend next to me gilbert, looks over and asks what i'm doing. i tell him about the game and the first thing he says is to name it the n word. that way it'll say "n caused anarchy in this country" or "n destroyed this country" or "n killed millions" and etc.

i had a laugh of it and named it just that. it seemed funny talking about where it started and how bad it got in countries. i showed gilbert and he was laughing hard. however my teacher caught me and said i need to stop messing around and take notes. so i pause the game and it shows the virus strain, what it looks like in the apes and humans, daily infections and deaths, and *oh god* the name big in the top left corner. i'm doing notes and again my teacher comes over and makes sure i'm doing my work. he looks at the game and says "what is that? some scientific study of someth-" he goes dead quiet and glares at me. i barely look up at him like huh? and then i realized the name on the screen, bright and big. i was gonna tell him it's not what it looks like but he starts walking away and says i really need to turn that off. 

i feel embarrassed and uncomfortable as gilbert starts dying of laughter at how i either came off as a racist or pissed my teacher off. without hesitation i delete the games progress, rename the virus to simian flu, and didn't make eye contact with the teacher for a week along with drawing attention to me. 

i still feel horribly awful about it

tifu by not drinking enough water (for several days in a row, actually). i'm on new medications that each severely dehydrate me, and during the summer i had no problem downing a bottle of water and peeing every hour or so, but now that school is back in session i'm not able to do that anymore.

didn't really take note of the fact that i hadn't pooped on a couple of days, so when i go to the bathroom for my nightly ablutions and feel that familiar urge, i plop myself down, whip out the phone, and get myself settled in for a satisfying poop. about a minute and a half in, i realize that this is not going to be a satisfying poop.

things are moving alone and i hear something hit the water, but there's still a lot to go. i'm taking the driest shit ever. little to mid-sized pieces are falling off the slow-moving but extremely thick poop torpedo stuck up my asshole. i'm straining, i'm shimmying, i'm squeezing and pushing, all trying to get my little turd-baby moving. 

nothing is working. my asshole is stretched to its limit. it's actually kind of like an ass vacuum in reverse--the first bit has fallen away (courtesy flush) but the next part hasn't moved further down. quite literally wedged beyond reach in my lower rectum. 

so after a good 40 minutes with no progress, i'm starting to have the terrible fear that i'm going to pop a brain aneurysm and die on the shitter. felt like leaving a note that would inform my loved ones that i wanted to be buried with the turd baby, and what name to give it on my tombstone. my choices are currently die on toilet, call someone for help, or, be my own damn fine hero.

so i steel myself, grab a few lengths of toilet paper, and then reach under and back ... and start digging in my own stretched out asshole to remove the giant blockage of dense, backed-up, compressed shit-pellets from my own anus. that's right, i'm digging in my own bung-hole to remove poop piece-by-bloody-mucus-covered-piece. my finger quickly breaks through the toilet paper guard, and my finger is mushing around in sticky, warm shit that is so well packed in my rectum. and each piece sticks to my finger as i try to work it out, and i go through a roll of tp wiping the shit off my finger and the bloody-slimy goo from around my asshole.

finally i got it all, or enough that my asshole could close again. i spent the next twenty minutes washing my in hot-as-fuck soapy water. it's two hours later and my asshole still burns.

at last, a tifu that actually happened today. horray, huzzah, haroo...

so pe was a bit different today because of us having to have injections. instead of us all doing a specific activity in our groups (we all do basketball or dodgeball or something) they instead decided to have us all do whatever we wanted out of a selection of things.

i wanted to shoot some hoops. there was a basketball in the football goal (that's where we store them when we're lazy or something), and i went to get it from the goal.

i think you all know what's about to happen.

i kneel down, grab the ball and get back up, only to bang my head really hard against the crossbar. it hurt really bad, and i was left crying for around 30 minutes. that's how bad it was. especially when you just had a meningitis c vaccination not even an hour earlier.

after seeing crank for the first time since it came out i wanted to go ahead and watch the second one. i didn't get very far when i fell asleep. i woke up late for class because my alarm was set to 9 pm not am (i just got a new phone, sue me).

i live off campus so i had to speed the whole way there. i somehow made it only a few minutes late. i was clearly disheveled. i also hadn't showered or anything. i was already that kid before i even opened my laptop.

the class was full today. there were 30 people cramped in one small room and there was only one seat left. i made my way to my seat and got settled. a lot of "excuse me, sorry. excuse me, sorry." i finally relaxed a little bit as i sat down. i took out my book and laptop to follow along with the notes.

my computer had died so i had to plug it in. i booted it up (once it's fully running it's pretty quick but it always takes a long time to boot). all of a sudden i start hearing a noise. at first, i thought it was someone's phone. omg it's coming from my computer. it was a woman talking in a very sensual tone. i try to turn down the volume or mute it but the buttons aren't responsive yet. i start to laugh nervously. i hadn't even watched that scene yet so i didn't know what was about to come. suddenly the voice clearly says, "*have some smelly snatch rubbed in your face.*" omg! wtf. and she wouldn't shut up. next i hear, "*...fucking whore. get your dick wet.*" i shut my computer immediately and it still wouldn't stop! 

[here's the scene: http://youtu.be/gu8ksz47c54?t=13s (start at 0:13)]

everyone clearly heard. and the voice continued in the same tone even though my laptop was shut. she was getting more and more sexual but the words were inaudible. i threw it in my bag but you could still hear it for another 20 seconds untill my computer realized i shut it.

everyone was laughing. this blind girl in front of me was losing it. my friend was laughing the hardest. even the prudes were laughing at me. i was mortified. i didn't defend myself because i didn't want to dig a deeper hole. i just put my head down in defeat.

so people think i either watch porn before class or watch so much porn that i fall asleep to it. worst part was my screen was black so i couldn't show them i wasn't watching porn.

inspired by another bird-related fu i thought i'd submit my own.

this was years ago, i think i was a sophomore in high school at the time. my buddy leon & i were some little punks back then. leather jackets, infrequent showers, the lot. we skipped class pretty much daily to smoke whatever crappy weed we could muster up for five bucks. there was a spot creatively known as "the woods" that we'd walk to to partake. on the way to the woods was a small pond with benches which we'd often sit at post-smokening to enjoy our high. 

on this fateful day, the ducks that often roost on the pond were paddling particularly close to the bench where we were perched. before i go any further, it must be noted that i love animals. i've been vegetarian since i was seven & would never hurt any creature on purpose. back to the story. i picked up a small pebble (no bigger than a dime) & underhanded it near the crowd of ducks. they must've thought it was food because they all quickly dove for it & came in closer. my buddy was cracking up, "stupid birds", & he followed suit. we did this for a minute until one of the pebbles actually landed on a duck's butt & bounced off; prompting a tail shake & quick indifference on the duck's part. stoned as we were, this was hilarious.

we sat there a few minutes & continued bouncing the pebbles off the ducks; no harm, no fowl. finally, my buddy had grown tired of our feathered jesters & picked up a bigger rock (no larger than a walnut, mind you) in hopes of scaring them off. he stood up, pulled back & chucked this rock. 

he was legitimately aiming for the water. instead, this rock hit a duck square in the middle of the neck. the duck's neck immediately *snapped* clean in the center. its head slumped over in the water, drowning, its wings flailing about fruitlessly. "oh fuck", leon covered his mouth with his hands, devastated by the rocky horror he'd personally unleashed on innocent honking bird, sending it to a premature, watery grave.

we stood there in shock for a minute as the rest of the ducks noped the fuck out and the twitches of the innocent flystander faded (along with the last of my friend's innocence). mouth still covered, he slowly shifts his gaze to me. "dude i... i didn't mean to...". his muffled explanation did nothing to change my reaction. i burst out laughing "dude!! you just fucking murdered that duck, you're a fucking dick! i can't wait till joel hears about this" lmao.

this was the only time i would ever see any remorse out of leon, and it was definitely genuine. not long after (though unrelated, he would claim), he too went vegetarian (after all the times he chastised me for it). to this day i bet his dreams are haunted by the garbled squawking of that floating poultry. may that poor duck breast in peace.

a little backstory first, i live in cuba and people here are just now starting to learn how to use the internet, making facebook accounts, posting pics on instagram, etc. it is still quite expensive at about $2us an hour for wifi and if you have a cell phone and want to use email on it on the go(still not internet) it's about $.20us per megabyte. needless to say this is not something your average cuban can afford to spend just to chat and make friends. 
also, my friend (the pranked) has always fantasized about motorcycles, but it is something most cubans can only wish to attain, even being one of the cheapest possible forms of transportation to own, an mz 250cc from the 80's can still run about $7000, which is basically a lifetime's worth of savings to a cuban on a good day.

 so this all began as a simple joke about a week ago when i discovered a website that would send anonymous text messages to a cell phone in cuba for free. my wife and i were at the local wifi spot with some friends when i sent one to my wife pretending to be some dude and she instantly figured me out and we laughed it off. a few minutes go by and one of my best friends shows up, so i send him a message saying i (the imaginary sender) am an admirer of his on facebook and would like to see more. i offer money for a pic in his underwear posted on his wall, and promise a motorcycle if he posts one without anything on at all. and wait for the reaction. it was one of intrigue and amusement. my wife caught on quickly and played along with me acting surprised and bewildered, and laughing at the idea that someone would send such a request. this is where the joke should have ended. however my wife and i thought it would be funny to keep this going for a bit and started teasing him about having a foreign (all the messages showed up as different area codes from different countries) sugar momma, and never got around to driving home the "got ya!" punchline. after a bit more joking around and entertaining his fantasy of what could be, and the possibility of him owning a motorcycle, it got late and everyone went home. except we never told him it was a joke. the next day, sure enough, there was a picture of him in his boxers on my facebook feed and he had also made a post saying only "who are you?". this is where it starts to get out of my hands. out of desperation to keep it going just a bit longer, so we could make fun of him for being so gullible later, i started sending more anonymous text messages saying how (the admirer) wanted to get to know him and visit cuba. this is when i made the worst mistake of all. but by now it was too late to turn back, i had put money into his wifi account on behalf of "josephine" (the admirer), created an email address for him to write back to, and sent him a picture of a woman i got from a google search matching the description i had given him. then the getting to know one another part started, and it got really weird. for me. and i no longer enjoyed this at all.
but now i can't stop. he has so much hope in this, that he feels his entire life is about to change. he told his whole family about her, and is no longer interested in local women. he has spent his savings to rent a motorcycle so he can practice and get a license, since josephine wants him to take her on one across the country when she comes to visit. i feel like any step i take to make him feel better will just dig us both into a deeper hole. my wife no longer wants anything to do with this, and says it has gotten past the point of cruelty. 
i can't say i disagree. what's worse, i think he wants to start sending nudes. 
this has reached the point that i may have to resort to something drastic to get him to stop, even if it breaks his heart and spirit. if josephine has to die for me to get everything back to normal, so be it. but i feel like normal may never happen, as it is i can't really look him in the eye anymore when he comes over to tell me the latest things "josephine" has said. but how can i get my friend back if i kill his dream girl? can he ever know the truth? what kind of friend am i? should i let him down as her, or as me?
i'm really tired of pretending to be a girl in the emails, and sure as hell dont ever want to see his balls. but why does he have to suffer because i put myself in a box?

today i was taking a biology test in class. these are the types of tests that they give you 30 minutes to do, all multiple choice (like 10 simple questions) and you can finish in 5 minutes tops. so usually i'm stuck sitting there for the next 25 minutes doing absolutely nothing. we weren't allowed to read a book, do other classwork, nothing. i forgot to mention this was one of those state tests like the njask (extremely strict) so all we could do was sit and wait in some of the most uncomfortable desks ever made. but there was hope. besides handing us out a test booklet and a pencil, we got a periodic table handout (have no fucking idea why we would need this, this is bio not chem). i had no choice. it was either desecrate the handout with meh doodles or die of boredom. so i began to draw. magnificent lines and shapes all over my paper. it would have sold for millions if they didn't take it away. so as i draw i came across uranium on the periodic table. the first thing that pops into my head is the spongebob "fun" song. so, being bored even of my beautiful symmetrical lines, began to write down the lyrics to the song. thought it was pretty funny, then really stupid. maybe i should get rid of it. nah. who hasn't heard it?
"time's up!"
my test and periodic table gets collected, even the pencil. at least i can chat with my friends now. we talk about how planting a billion trees is a stupid idea and isn't a long term solution to the rising co2 levels (trees are still cool though). an hour later, i receive a special visit from my vice principal. he tells me to get my stuff and follow him. at first, i think this is about how he's going to talk to me about how i keep playing tank trouble (best game for reking scrubs) on the computers at school. i get to his office and he shows me the periodic table handout with my scribbles on it. 
wut? 
i'm completely blanked out about what's so bad about it. he says if i wrote the fun song on the handout. i go "yis. dat me." he tells me that only a psychopath would be able to write something so demonic and evil. and that psychopath is me. he tells me why i want to burn the town down, make uranium bombs, and leave no survivors. i'm stunned and say that i would never do something like that. i realize that the man has never seen spongebob in his entire life. i say the lyrics are from a spongebob episode. doesn't believe me. i say that he should look it up. doesn't. he says he called the police to come and interrogate me. i give up. all i can do now is try and be civil and be as formal as possible and ask as many questions about my situation. since i am considered a psychopath, i wonder if they are going to set me up with a psychiatrist and take me out of school. i ask and he says "funny you would ask that..." he thinks i now have a record for being a criminally insane mastermind and that i stomp on puppies for shits and giggles because i'm not crying on the floor begging for mercy and instead asked a logical question. he says no school for me this week (i have a final 2 pt. test in geometry honors, now i am going to fucking miss it), i have to see a psychiatrist, might get fined, going to get recorded, and might go to court. my life is now fucked up, by the fun song. at least i got reddit for the rest of the week. and i get to fuck scrubs on dark souls 2 pvp all day ery day.

so this happened three years ago, 
it was junior year of high school so of course at that point no one wants to do something embarrassing that they’ll hear about from everyone they know right up until graduation night. i of course am posting to tifu so this was exactly what happened to me. for starters my high school was a smaller off shoot of the main high school in my town which i went to because the public high school was wayyy over crowded, think 5,000 students in a building designed to accommodate 3,000, shit’s crazy, not to mention there is literally a pig farm behind the campus that the bigger school uses for ffa classes and we had a dirt and gravel parking lot. the problem with going to the smaller school is that you get to know everyone in your class, e.g. when i graduated there were at most 20 people all of whom i knew by first and last names on stage getting their diplomas. 
 now for the fuckup part; there is a jack in the box within walking distance and i love me some of those jalapeno poppers. this particular day when i was in the jack in the box i asked for plenty of ranch with my stuff, and they obliged with a handful of the stuff. after lunch i still had a few left so i stuffed them in my jacket pocket with my thumb drives (i took a lot of tech classes so i had a keychain with 50 gigabytes of flash drives on it that i kept in my pocket) 

time passes...
 
 upon arriving back at school i was on the way up our dirt road when the breeze picked up and i got a good whiff of pig manure on a sunny day which some of you may know is the kind of smell that drowns out any other smell that is in the air. a minute later i’m walking toward my class and my hands get cold, so i put my hands in my pockets and start to feel around and realize that something in my pocket is rather slimy, then the smell goes from pigs to ranch dressing. then i remember the ranch and start to feel something wet near my belly button. so i mentally scream ‘oh shit’ and divert course to stop in the bathroom. when i get in there i empty my pockets of my ranch coated flash drives and get my jacket off (which incidentally has a small hole in the pocket that i was aware of but didn’t really care about.) i look down and there is a bunch of globs of ranch running down the middle of my shirt. so i first wet a paper towel and wipe off the flash drives because they’re not meant to be covered in ranch and i have a lot important files on them, amazingly they all survived. then i immediately go to the job of scrubbing the front of my shirt which happens to be black and really shows the white texture. at this exact moment the door to the bathroom swings open and who should enter but my primary teacher/educational guidance counselor. in this moment the implications of this scene occur to me and my teacher looks over to see me standing at the sink with the water running, jacket rolled up on the counter, moist towel in hand scrubbing frantically at a bunch white splotchy stains on my lower shirt. what followed was the most awkward dead stare i've ever gotten in my life; we must have stood there looking at each other in silence for at least a good minute, all the while the sound of running water in the background. then after the sight sunk in he took a deep breath, which must have smelled heavily of buttermilk ranch, exhaled and walked back out to his classroom. because i’m me and the situational irony had just hit me, i started laughing like i’d just finished my doomsday machine and the world would soon be my bitch. loudly i laughed, loudly enough as i later learned that my teacher had stood outside the door for a few more seconds and listened to me losing my shit before he took off. thus i ended up having to explain to awkwardly explain to that man that what he saw was not what it looked like and that it was ranch, he actually believed me citing the smell of ranch that had been pervading the bathroom all day.

i'm not using a throw away cause this story isn't too horrible. just awkward as fuck. also like most fuck up's on here, this didn't happen today. it happened last summer. here we go. 

during the summer months i spend most of my time at the trailer. i have a load of friends up there and it is generally a big party. 

one day my two buddies and i went to go hangout with a couple of girls. they agreed, but wanted to shower first. we head down to the public bathroom and they each choose their shower stall and go about their business.

a couple of seconds later a young girl and her much younger sister show up to use the bathroom. my two buddies and i were waiting far enough away from the bathroom for our friends to finish showering. we weren't creepily close. that's when the noises start...

i have never in my life heard a little girl make such a noise. it sounded like the [predator](http://slog.thestranger.com/files/2008/06/predator.jpg) squeal. 

automatically i say, "wtf was that!?" to my buddies and we move closer to check it out. i moved closer to the door and non-chalanty listed for a few seconds and moved away. she was still making the noise. i just want to remind you that her older sister was also inside with her. she kept remarking, "shut up!" "stop making that noise! it doesn't hurt that bad!" i'm just going to assume she was taking a massive dump and it hurt really bad... 

after i moved away from the door my one buddy took his turn listening. instead of doing a slow walk by the door, he fucking stopped and but his ear up against the door. i didn't know he was doing this until the little girls father walked up behind him. oh boy. 

"get the fuck away from my daughters you fucking pedophile!" "im calling the police on you!" you'll be fucking arrested and raped in jail." i shit you not, the father said every single word quoted here to my buddy. 

every single person in the immediate vicinity came out of their trailer, and seen us getting screamed at. so everyone's reaction was to scream at the guy for screaming at us. it almost caused a fist fight. 

our lady friends in the shower? they just ran away scared from all the screaming. 

to wrap things up, the aftermath was relatively mild. my buddy who was at the door; listening, apologized to the angry father. it turned out the guy was piss drunk and just lost his shit. i also apologized for standing near the area even though i didn't have my ear to the door. in the very end the guy left the park and we've never spoke of the incident again. 

enjoy my (well kind of my friends) tifu. inform me if i fucked up grammatically.

was playing outside with my little brother. 

we threw small machetes at each other and parried with our wooden shields. 

he hid behind a large box. 

i threw machete. 

he walked away from the box and stared at me. 

he had a machete stuck in his head. 

a fucking machete. 

we stared at each other and he was like: 

"do i.. do i have a fucking machete in my head?" 

fortunately, it was small, and only the tip went in. the machete was upright and he didn't bleed *that* much.

obligatory "happened years ago" (when i was in 5th grade, am now out of college). 

anyways, one day in the middle of winter i was a "safety monitor" for kids walking to school. it was in michigan so it was cold, but the teacher in charge of us made hot chocolate that day. i get the hot chocolate and go about my day, feeling worse and worse as the day went on. my teacher noticed this and asked if i was okay, i told her i wasn't feeling good, she told me to keep her updated. more time passes and my condition deteriorates, and she tells me to go to the school office to call my parents to come and get me. i walk down there, the secretary asked what was wrong. i begin to say "my teacher told me to come call my parents to pick me up because i do not feel good." it was at this point, the principle walked out of her office and was standing in front of me. i got though about half of what i was going to say, and then it happened. i projectile vomited on my principle. to make matters worse, i went to apologize about 2 seconds after, and before i could speak, i vomited again, also directly on her. 

subsequently my dad was called and told to come pick me up. since my dad worked half an hour away, i got to be there for the entire cleanup process, including the part where the teacher and principle discussed how the principle thought i should get suspended for it, but they ultimately decided it was something i didn't know what about to happen.
