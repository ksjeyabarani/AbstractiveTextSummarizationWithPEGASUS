global warming is causing a crisis in polar bears , a species that draws upon many common traits . 
 scientists say this is a false alarm because polar bears , despite being endangered , are merely the tip of the iceberg in their impacts . 
 the collapse of polar bear sea ice in the summer is already causing mass mortalities , increasing the threat of conflict between humans and non - human animals . 
 the rising temperatures and loss of sea ice are expected to cause more conflict between humans and non - human animals . 
 the conflict will be magnified by climate change , which is already causing global warming . 
 the conflict will be compounded by the fact that polar bears are small animals and thus are less vulnerable to damage than other species . 
 the conflict will be compounded by the fact that polar bears are the only animals whose critical period of the year , during which they feed and migrate to 
 feeding grounds , is delayed .
