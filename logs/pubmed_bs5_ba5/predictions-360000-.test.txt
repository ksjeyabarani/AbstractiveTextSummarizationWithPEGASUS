several chemoprotective properties of lycopene on prostate cancer have been proposed . 
 these mechanistic studies have stimulated the examination of lycopene and its primary source , tomato products , on risk of prostate cancer . 
 however , studies on lycopene and tomato product intake and prostate cancer incidence have yielded mixed results . 
 the study of this relationship has been complicated by unique and challenging epidemiologic considerations in the measurement of lycopene and on the influence of prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) screening on prostate cancer incidence and progression . as with all epidemiologic studies , 
 this paper briefly describes the methodology essential for conducting studies on the association between lycopene and prostate cancer incidence and provides an updated review of studies of lycopene and tomato products with prostate cancer risk .

background : the goal of clinical blood transfusion is to provide qualitative , safe , and adequate blood to recipient . 
 the main sources of blood procurement are commercial ( remunerated ) blood donors , voluntary donors , and replacement donors . 
 blood transfusion is a known risk factor for transmission of infectious diseases including viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) , and hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) . 
 the risk of transmission is highest with blood procured from commercial donors . 
 several nations have made frantic efforts and are making significant improvement towards achieving 100% voluntary donor blood procurement but not so much has been achieved in nigeria . 
 only 5% of voluntary donation has been achieved in some major donor centers in nigeria .

the torque web server implements a novel method for querying protein networks that does not require information on the interconnections ( topology ) among the query proteins . 
 this makes torque applicable in broader scenarios , such as querying complexes or pathways whose topologies are not completely known , or even when querying from species for which topology information is not available . 
 it combines three approaches : a dynamic programming method utilizing color coding , integer linear programming and a fast heuristic based on shortest paths . 
 torque automatically selects the best method to apply at each stage and outputs the highest scoring match .

 glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( gdnf ) has been associated with significant effects with respect to preventing cell death , including the protection of specific neuronal populations in the brain , spinal cord , and retina . 
 previously , we showed that it is possible to derive neural progenitor cells ( npcs ) from the developing cat brain and that these cells are capable of integration into the retina of dystrophic feline recipients . 
 to more fully exploit the potential of this model , it is useful to develop feline npcs capable of sustained growth factor delivery to the host retina . 
 here we use a bicistronic feline lentiviral vector to generate genetically modified feline neural progenitor cells that exhibit sustained overexpression of gdnf before and after differentiation . 
 our results show that gdnf - expressing npcs can migrate extensively into the retina of dystrophic feline recipients . 
 in addition , gdnf - expressing npcs are able to grow in the retina of dystrophic feline recipients .

biliary hamartoma is a benign congenital malformation of the biliary duct which was described for the first time in 1918 by von mayenburg , therefore it is also called von mayenburg complex ( vmcs ) . 
 although jaundice and portal hypertension may arise as a result of mass effect , patients are usually asymptomatic . 
 the biliary hamartomas may be single or multiple , with size ranging between 1 and 15 mm . 
 biliary hamartomas usually presents as multiple small nodules and despite the fact that they are rare , they may be confused with liver metastatic disease , microabscesses , diffuse primary hepatocellular carcinoma , biliary cysts or caroli s disease .

backgroundthe korean government introduced a new social insurance scheme for long - term care ( ltc ) in july 2008 . 
 this insurance uses the ltc grade for denoting how much help is required for an elderly person in their daily lives . 
 the proper use of medicines and monitoring for adverse effects are important factors in the treatment of elderly patients . in 2012 , the american geriatrics society ( ags ) and an interdisciplinary panel of experts in geriatric care and pharmacotherapy reached a consensus on the 2012 ags beers criteria . 
 we evaluate the frequency of inappropriate medication use in elderly patients admitted to nursing homes in korea by applying the newly revised 2012 ags beers criteria.methodsa retrospective cross - sectional survey study was performed in patients aged 65 years or older , which produced a sample of 824 people admitted to 20 nursing facilities in northwest korea from january 2012 to february 2012 .

extrahepatic portal venous obstruction ( ehpvo ) is the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in children and is also a common cause of variceal bleeding in adults . 
 ehpvo has been attributed to umbilical sepsis after birth with thrombosis extending to the portal system via the patent umbilical vein or portal pyaemia following intra - abdominal sepsis . 
 the characteristic findings are the replacement of portal vein by multiple tortuous vessels , also known as cavernous transformation , with hepatopetal blood flow in the collaterals . 
 investigations to confirm the diagnosis are usually simple and readily available at most centres . 
 patients with ehpvo have normal liver function ( and histology ) which helps them to sustain bleeding episodes without decompensation . 
 however , mortality rates of between 5 and 30% have been reported for a single bleeding episode because of the large volumes of blood lost in patients who do not have access to sophisticated medical facilities including blood transfusion . with the advent of endoscopic therapy , this soon became the predominant treatment modality for the control of acute bleeding and also an important method for the prevention of a repeated bleeding episode . 
 the main disadvantages of endotherapy are that it requires multiple sessions and

the three lincosamides , lincomycin , clindamycin , and pirlimycin , are clinically important antibiotics used against a broad spectrum of bacteria . 
 lincosamides block bacterial protein synthesis , which takes place on the ribosomes . 
 however , extensive use of these antibiotics has led to increased resistance in many strains of bacteria , which have been developing various mechanisms to counter these drugs . 
 one known mechanism is structural modification of the drug s target ( ribosome ) through the methylation of 23s rna ( e.g. , base no . 
 2058 ) and/or mutations ( e.g. , of bases g2057 , a2058 , c2452 , and c2611 ) . 
 other mechanisms of resistance are active efflux of the drug across the cell surface , or its enzymatic deactivation . 
 bacterial resistance together with side effects are the most important reasons for improving known lincosamides and designing modified compounds . 
 the conformational properties of free clindamycin and lincomycin have been studied using x - ray techniques as well as 1

angiogenesis has been described as one of the hallmarks of cancer , playing an essential role in tumour growth , invasion , and metastasis . 
 since tumour blood vessels show many differences from normal vessels and are not genetically unstable , they are potential targets for therapy of all types of cancer . due to the pivotal role played by endothelial cells in tumour angiogenesis , 
 most previous efforts were devoted to the development of agents that could block their activation by an angiogenic signal ( mainly vegf ) , or to inhibit one or several specific functions of activated endothelial cells ( proliferation , adhesion to extracellular matrix , proteolytic activities , migration , invasion or differentiation ) . in spite of the great number of angiogenesis inhibitors described so far , and the interesting results obtained in experimental models , even showing complete tumour regressions in pre - clinical studies , modest or even negative results emerged from the first generation of compounds entered in clinical trials . 
 nevertheless , there is no reason for premature pessimism , as revealed by current ongoing trials and the clinical developmental status of anti - angiogenic drugs .

the association of pancreatic disease with fat necrosis at distant foci was first described by chiari in 1883 . 
 the most common pancreatic disorders associated with pancreatic panniculitis are acute or chronic pancreatitis , especially the alcohol - related types , and pancreatic carcinoma . 
 other pancreatic disorders have been infrequently reported to be associated with pancreatic panniculitis , and these include post - traumatic pancreatitis , pancreatic pseudocyst , pancreas divisum , and hemophagocytic syndrome . 
 we report here on a case of pancreatic panniculitis associated with acute pancreatitis that had a fatal outcome . 
 physicians should be aware of this disease entity because this rare cutaneous manifestation may be associated with major morbidity and significant mortality .

point - of - care testing ( poct ) is an increasingly popular means of delivering laboratory tests close to the patient . 
 however , if inappropriate samples are collected , specimen is mislabeled , analysis is performed incorrectly , or test is misinterpreted , wrong results may be reported and acted on by the clinician . 
 laboratory directors should know our processes and take steps to detect and prevent errors before those mistakes reach the clinician and affect patient care . 
 risk management is a way to reduce errors with poct . 
 risk is the chance of suffering harm or loss , and risk can also apply to the operator of the poct device , the laboratory administration and even the hospital and its reputation .

backgroundthe aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of low back pain ( lbp ) in students participating in sports , and to compare the prevalence of lbp between males and females.methodsthis is a retrospective cross - sectional survey involving students at the higher institute of sport and physical education in the city of sfax . 
 data on age , weight , height , and smoking habits are collected routinely when students join the institute , and then the sport in which the student is injured in the low back is registered in the institute health service files . 
 lbp was defined as pain or discomfort in the low - back region , from the lower rib curvature to the lower part of the seat region . 
 the question used systematically by the doctor of the institute health service to identify and estimate lbp cases was about the present injury and if and when they had lbp in the past . 
 furthermore , every registered injury causing lbp was recorded with its severity , but the most important detail for us was the sport in which the student was injured . 
 students who were injured more than one time were taken into account as subjects with lbp only for their first injury.resultsa total

therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to provide neuroprotection against ischemic injury after cardiac arrest in in vitro and in vivo models . in the previous issue of critical care , meybohm and 
 colleagues demonstrate that cardiac arrest triggers the release of cerebral inflammatory cytokines in pigs ' cerebral cortex . 
 the combination of hypothermia with sevoflurane post - conditioning does not confer additional anti - inflammatory effects compared with hypothermia alone .

 geological disposal facilities ( gdf ) proposed by 
 us and european waste management organisations employ an engineered 
 multibarrier approach to retard the release of radioactive species 
 from the waste in quantities that could be detrimental to life and the 
 environment . 
 a significant obstacle to implementation of gdf is public and political 
 concern around risks and consequences of failure against design criteria 
 over the 10 to 10 year required lifespan of the facility , highlighted 
 by several failures to site gdf repositories , e.g. , in the uk and at yucca mountain 
 in the usa . 
 an improved understanding of the behavior of pertechnetate 
 in proposed barrier materials is also necessary to evaluate the potential 
 of different design specifications to mitigate or remove the potential hazard . 
 
 quantitative imaging techniques offer a means of achieving this information 
 and have been developed to study reactive transport in porous media 
 for a range of materials .

backgroundhigh intensity resistance exercise ( ret ) can cause damage to lipid membranes , proteins , deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) and other cellular components . 
 the damage to lipid membranes , otherwise known as lipid peroxidation is defined as the oxidative deterioration of polyunsaturated fats in cellular lipid membranes caused by oxygen free radicals . 
 the area of antioxidant supplementation and its ameliorating effects on exercise induced free radical damage ( including lipid peroxidation ) has attracted considerable interest in recent years . 
 the primary objectives of the investigation were to determine : ( 1 ) whether a high intensity , whole body resistance exercise test ( ret ) caused lipid peroxidation measures to significantly increase , ( 2 ) the effects of a 2 week period of antioxidant vitamin supplementation ( vitamin e ) on the levels of lipid peroxidation measures caused by the ret , and ( 3 ) the impact that the training state ( untrained vs trained ) had on possible lipid peroxidation measures caused by the ret.methodstwenty-seven participants were recruited for this investigation . 
 the participants were randomly assigned to an untrained ( n = 9 ) and trained ( n = 9 ) group

abstractasthma has been described as an acephalic migraine and pulmonary migraine , and several epidemiologic studies have reported an association between migraine and respiratory disorders . 
 however , no study has investigated the temporal frequency of migraine development in patients with asthma . 
 therefore , we conducted this retrospective nationwide cohort study by using data retrieved from taiwan 's national health insurance research database ( nhird ) to test the hypothesis that patients with asthma have a higher risk of migraine.we conducted a nationwide retrospective population - based cohort study involving 2 groups : an asthma group and a nonasthma group . 
 for each patient with asthma , 4 insured persons without a diagnosis of asthma were selected from the longitudinal health insurance database 2000 as the nonasthma group and were frequency - matched according to sex , age , and index year by using the same inclusion criteria as those of the asthma cohort.we identified 41,011 patients newly diagnosed with asthma ( icd-9-cm 493 ) between january 1 , 2000 and december 31 , 2005 . 
 we excluded patients younger than 12 years ( n = 13,813 ) , previously diagnosed with migraine ( n = 1635

objectives : the aim of this study was to assess the enamel cracks after debonding of brackets bonded with two different adhesive systems and also to evaluate enamel cracks after removing adhesive remnants and enamel polishing.materials and methods : sixty upper central incisors were randomly divided into two equal groups . in the first group , the buccal surface of each central incisor 
 was debonded with transbond xt ( 3 m , usa ) . in the second group , 
 the same bracket was bonded with self - adhesive composite cement ( maxcem elite , kerr , usa ) . in both groups , 
 the adhesive was cured for 40 seconds ( 10 seconds on each side of the bracket ) . 
 the teeth were then incubated in distilled water at 37c for 24 hours to allow the material to set . 
 all the brackets were debonded with rmo i-546 remover pliers . 
 the blades of the pliers were placed at the bracket - adhesive interface and a gentle squeezing force was applied to the pliers by a zwick / z250 at a speed of 0.5 mm / min until bond failure occurred .

osteopetrosis is a rare inherited bone disease characterized by increased bone mass . 
 osteopetrosis is an osteocondensing disease . in principle 
 , two causes could give rise to this osteocondensing phenotype : increased bone formation or failure of resorption by osteoclasts . 
 however , osteopetrosis is known to result from defective osteoclast differentiation or function . 
 important progress has been made during the past decades in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of hereditary diseases characterized by increased bone mass . 
 our objective in this review is not to give a detailed description of all the sclerosing bone diseases ; such information can be found in other reviews . 
 instead , we discuss recent findings regarding osteopetrosis and how the study of this disease has contributed to new understanding of functions associated with the skeleton .

segmental copy - number variations ( cnvs ) , involving the gain or loss of several hundreds of bases to several hundred kilobases ( kb ) of the genome , can be an important source of genetic variation among human populations of different ethnic groups as well as among individuals . in this report 
 , we focus on cnvs which were observed at a high frequency ( 5.0% of the individuals ) in the population residing in hiroshima and nagasaki , japan by array comparative genomic hybridization ( acgh ) with bacterial artificial chromosome ( bac ) clones as targets . 
 the majority of the clones used in this study were selected from the set of cytogenetically mapped p1-artificial chromosome ( pac ) clones and bacterial artificial chromosome ( bac ) clones reported by the bac resource consortium and obtained from either the children 's hospital oakland research institute or from invitrogen inc . with respect to examination for stage ( 1 ) , three sets of arrays were constructed and imprinted : slide no.1 , consisted of 698 clones on chromosomes 1 to 4 ; slide no.2 consisted of 718 clones on chromosomes 5 to 10 , plus two

nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) , a key transcription factor that regulates the cellular antioxidant response , plays a broader role in modulating acute inflammatory response . in this study 
 , we evaluated the influence of nrf2 genotype on the cerebral upregulation of nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) activity , proinflammatory cytokine , and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( icam-1 ) after traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) . 
 we found that nrf2 ( + /+ ) mice exhibited reduced cerebral nf-b activation and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and icam-1 after tbi . 
 furthermore , nrf2 ( / ) mice exhibited reduced cerebral nf-b activation and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and icam-1 after tbi . 
 these results suggest that nrf2 plays an important role in limiting the cerebral inflammatory response after tbi .

the data revolution in healthcare is an offshoot of the vast amount of digital medical information that has now accumulated in electronic medical records . 
 the vision is for a population data - driven knowledge system that generalizes from every patient s life , disease and treatment experiences to impute the best course of action for diagnosis , prognosis and treatment of future patients . 
 the challenge is the transformation of the copious data into usable and useful medical knowledge . 
 clinicians must already make sense of a diverse variety of data input streams in order to make clinical decisions . and how can increasing amounts of data be incorporated into a system of already overburdened clinicians ? 
 this paper will discuss the general issue of data in critical care with a focus on the big data phenomenon that is sweeping healthcare .
