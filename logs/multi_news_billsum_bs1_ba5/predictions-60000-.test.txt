– A new law is meant to help prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in meat and eggs, but it's actually a pretty easy way to get your hands on those eggs. The Consumerist reports on the changes to the FDA's Inspection Act, which went into effect in July and requires meat and egg producers to submit a list of bacteria and fungi they're testing for in their products. The list will be updated every three years, and the FDA will also require companies to submit a list of any "additional microbial pathogens" they've tested for, as well as a list of the antibiotics they've been tested for. The law is meant to help prevent the spread of bacteria that can cause meningitis, pneumonia, and other infections, but it's also meant to help prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are now resistant to not less than two "critically important antibiotics," as per the World Health Organization. The law is a response to a 2014 study that found meat and egg producers had been knowingly marketing tainted products, according to the Wall Street Journal. The study found that between 2000 and 2014, the FDA investigated 388 food- and animal-safety violations involving meat and eggs, and found that almost half of them were for bacteria.

– President Trump's budget proposal for 2018 includes a record $516 billion for the Pentagon, a record for the Department of Homeland Security, and a record for the NIH, reports the Hill. But it's not all rosy news for the military. The proposal also includes cuts to defense programs that the Pentagon says it needs to make in order to keep the government open. The White House is calling the plan "an important step in the right direction," but it's not clear whether it will be enough to appease rank-and-file members of both parties in Congress. The GOP-controlled House is expected to take up the plan next week, and Democrats are likely to follow suit. The White House says Trump's plan includes cuts to programs that help military veterans, their families, and members of the armed forces pay for medical care. The Pentagon, meanwhile, says it needs to cut $5 billion from its budget to keep the government open. The move is in line with a 1993 law that Congress passed to cut spending, reports the Washington Post.

– When a 60-year-old woman in Florida was charged with fraud for using a private dental plan, she argued that she was entitled to it. But a judge has now ruled that she's not, and ordered the plan to pay her more than $3 million, the Miami Herald reports. The woman, identified in court documents as Jane Doe B, says she was charged $500 per visit to a private dental office in St. Petersburg, and the charges were covered under her Blue Cross-Florida plan. But when she went to the office to get a tooth removed, she was told she was covered under a "billing rule," which requires patients to pay up to 50% of their bill. Doe B says she was charged twice that amount. Her lawyer says she was charged because she was 60 and had private dental insurance. The judge, however, ruled that Blue Cross-Florida had violated a 1997 law that requires plans to cover patients under "managed care," which is what Doe B was enrolled in. The Herald notes that Blue Cross-Florida has since apologized for the charges, saying it "understands and is accountable for the care provided to its members." The case could have implications for other dental plans, as Doe B is a state resident. A post at Forbes suggests that

– The EPA is poised to issue new rules designed to curb the release of greenhouse gases from cars and light trucks, reports the Hill. The rules, which will be finalized next month, will require automakers to submit emissions estimates for the gases they release. The big question is whether the EPA will be able to enforce them, given that Congress has yet to pass legislation to do so. The agency is expected to issue the rules in a matter of weeks, and the New York Times thinks they're going to be a big hit. “This is going to be a huge impact,” says an analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It’s going to put a lot of pressure on the industry to come up with ways to meet the standards.” The industry is worried that the rules will drive up prices of fuel, and they're already working to develop alternative fuels.

– The US Air Force Academy is getting a major boost from Congress, with a bill introduced in the House this week that would make it eligible for $1 billion in federal funds, the AP reports. The bill would allow the Air Force to join the National Academy of Space, which is part of the Department of Defense. The idea is to boost the number of space cadets from the current 5,000 to 10,000 by 2045, according to the Washington Post. The Air Force is currently the only service branch that doesn't have a national academy. The bill would also allow the Academy to accept students from any state that has a military academy. The bill is expected to pass the House and Senate this week.

– President Obama has a plan to boost US exports, but it's not going over well with the small-business community. The White House is asking Congress to cut the Office of the President's Export Promotion budget by 30%, to just $157 million, reports the Hill. The move is part of a larger effort to cut spending and refocus the Export Promotion Office, which was created in 1988 to promote US exports. "We're going to have to do a lot of soul-searching," says one small-business advocate. "We're talking about a small office with a lot of people who are going to be doing a lot of soul-searching." Obama's plan would cut the Export Promotion Office's budget by 30% over the next five years, but it would still have a bigger impact than the Bush administration's cuts, which lowered the office's budget by 30% over the same period. The move is expected to anger small-business advocates who say the White House is ignoring their concerns. "The president is ignoring the small-business community," says one such advocate. "He's not listening to them."

– The House has voted to extend for another two years the popular Medicare drug benefit for millions of seniors who are dual eligible—but the Senate is unlikely to do the same. The Medicare and Medicaid Dual Prescription Drug Coverage Act of 2005—which passed the House last month—covers about 6 million people who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid but who don't yet have access to the same drug plan, the New York Times reports. The extension will allow them to continue receiving coverage even if they switch plans, but advocates say it will be a huge help to people who are already struggling to pay for prescriptions. "It's a huge help to them, and it's a huge help to the government because they're not getting the education and support they need," says a senior policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The extension will allow the government to keep track of people who switch plans and keep them from getting dropped, the Washington Post reports.

– A new law is set to make it easier for people who have hearing loss to collect Social Security, the New York Times reports. The law, which was signed into law by President Obama last week, will allow people who have had hearing loss for at least three years to collect up to 75% of their normal monthly hearing loss amount. Previously, people who had had hearing loss for more than three years were limited to collecting 50%. The law will also allow people who have had hearing loss for more than five years to collect 100% of their normal hearing loss amount. "It's a very significant change," says a lawyer for one group of people who are worried about the law. "It's going to make a huge difference to people who have hearing loss." The law will also allow people who have had hearing loss for more than five years to collect 100% of their normal hearing loss amount. The law was signed by Obama, who says it will help people who have had hearing loss and their families.

– A former cop in Texas who was fired for using excessive force against a restrained suspect is suing the state for wrongful termination. The suit filed by former officer David Walker claims that he was fired for using excessive force when he handcuffed Eric Garner in a New York City park in July 2014, reports the New York Times. Walker, who was off-duty at the time, says he was handcuffed by a group of men who were trying to get into a van he was riding in and that he was trying to get away from them when he was shot. He says he was shot in the back and that he was handcuffed and put in a police van, where he was again handcuffed and put in the van. "I was put in a situation where I was going to die," he says. "I was put in a situation where I was going to die. I was put in a situation where I was going to die. I was put in a situation where I was going to die." Walker's suit says that when he was arrested, he was found to have a gun on him, and that police had threatened to kill him and his family if he didn't put the gun down, the Houston Chronicle reports. He says he was handcuffed and put in the van because he

– The government is cracking down on Russian spies—and it's not just because of the country's alleged meddling in US elections. The feds say Russian agents have been spying on the US for years, and they've been using "a wide range of tactics, including covert operations, to gather intelligence on US activities," the New York Times reports. The US, for its part, says the Russian agents have been stealing data on American military exercises. The feds say the agents have been using everything from "highly classified" sources to "unclassified" information on US military exercises. The US says the Russian agents have been stealing information on the country's nuclear programs, including the country's ability to deploy long-range ballistic missiles. The FBI says the agents have been stealing information on the US' ability to deploy those missiles, as well as on military exercises. The US says the agents have been stealing information on the country's ability to deploy those missiles, as well as on military exercises. The Times notes that the Russian government has denied any involvement in the alleged spying.

– The Supreme Court today struck down a key part of President Obama's health care reform, ruling that the individual mandate to buy insurance is unconstitutional, reports the AP. The 5-4 decision came after arguments in favor of the law in front of a panel of justices that included Antonin Scalia and John Roberts. The mandate requires most Americans to buy insurance, and the justices said that since it's a tax, the president has the power to decide whether it's constitutional to pay for it. (The AP has the full text.) The decision was not a huge surprise, notes the New York Times, which had predicted that the court would uphold the law's central tenet: that people can buy insurance regardless of their medical conditions. The justices said that since the mandate is a tax, the president has the power to decide whether it's constitutional. The decision means that the individual mandate is in effect, at least for the time being.

– The Obama administration is readying a massive injection of cash to expand high-speed Internet access in rural America. The Department of Agriculture is readying a whopping $8 billion in loans and grants to help build and deploy broadband networks in areas that have been left behind by the digital revolution, reports the New York Times. The money will come from the unspent funds of the stimulus bill, and the department is working with the private sector to help build networks that can deliver Internet up to 100 times faster than the current speeds. "This is a game-changer," says one industry analyst. "It's going to change the way we do business." The program is being hailed as a big step forward by rural-serving groups, but it's not without its critics. The program is "demonstrably anti-business," says one Iowa lawmaker. "It's like giving a free pass to Wall Street."

– The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is in the midst of a major overhaul that will see thousands of new rules issued by the agency, the New York Times reports. Among the changes: The CFPB will no longer require that companies that offer financial products have to disclose their earnings. Instead, companies will have to disclose only their profits. The agency will also require that those reporting their profits include a "heads up" that they're going to be taxed. The change is expected to save the CFPB an estimated $150 million a year, according to the Wall Street Journal. The agency will also be required to conduct more cost-benefit analyses. The change is expected to be finalized in June. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created in 1996 under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Washington Post reports. The law gave Congress the power to review and approve "significant rules," and the CFPB was given the authority to issue them. But the agency has been slow to implement the law. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is suing the federal government, claiming it has violated the law by failing to provide the necessary information. The lawsuit claims the CFPB has also failed to provide the proper paperwork, the Post reports. The agency says it will be required to provide that information to Congress if it doesn't comply with

– If you're a resident of New York state and you want to save on college tuition, you can do so by contributing to the state's529 plan. The plan, which allows you to save up to 20% of your annual tuition costs at state universities, was put into place by the state legislature in 2000 and made available to all residents in 2001. But the Wall Street Journal reports that lawmakers are now considering changing the law to make it more difficult to save on tuition. The Journal explains that the current law allows students to save up to 20% of their tuition costs, but it doesn't allow them to save more than that. The proposed change would allow students to save up to 30% of their tuition costs. The Journal reports that the change would be a "largely symbolic" change because the state's529 plan is popular with residents of all income levels. But it would also be a major change because it would require students to contribute more to the plan than they do to their 401(k) accounts. The proposed change would also require students to contribute more to their 403(b) accounts than they do to their 529 plans. The New York State Department of Financial Services says that because the change would require students to contribute more to the plans than they do to their

– The Department of Transportation is cracking down on airlines that don't give passengers enough notice that they're about to be delayed. The rule, which took effect Aug. 1, requires airlines to inform passengers at least 24 hours in advance of a flight's delay and to give them a "reasonable explanation" for the delay, the New York Times reports. The department also will require airlines to post information on their websites explaining the "residual value" of a ticket and to give passengers a full refund if they ask for one within 48 hours. The rule is part of a larger effort to curb airline "deceptive practices," the Wall Street Journal reports. The DOT has also ordered airlines to give passengers a choice between paying a fee for a seat on a flight that is sold out and paying a fee for a seat that is not sold out.

– When a woman in Ohio lost her job at a McDonald's drive-thru, she filed a complaint with the state's Department of Labor and Industry, which investigated and found that her pay was violated, the Columbus Dispatch reports. The woman, identified in court documents as RN, says she worked 60 hours a week at the restaurant in Lima, about 30 miles from Columbus, from July 2014 to February 2015. She says she was paid what she should have been paid—$80 per week—and that she was "deprived of overtime and other benefits" because of it. The DOL found that McDonald's violated two laws: One, which states employers must pay overtime to all workers, including temporary workers, who work more than 40 hours per week. The second, which states employers must pay overtime to all workers who work more than 40 hours per week. RN says she was paid what she should have been paid—$80 per week—and that she was "deprived of her time, her money, and her dignity" because of it. The Dispatch notes that the McDonald's drive-thru is one of many businesses in Ohio that have been fined for not paying their workers minimum wage. (A McDonald's manager was sentenced to prison for

– The House today overwhelmingly passed a bill that would provide Israel with some $60 billion in US military aid over the next decade, reports the Hill. The measure is part of a larger defense bill that also includes a $10 billion loan guarantee for Israel to help it deal with potential threats from Iran and Syria. The White House has threatened to veto it. The bill is "vital," says a spokesman for Benjamin Netanyahu, because it "will help to strengthen Israel's ability to defend itself." It also "represents a significant expansion of US military aid to Israel," notes the New York Times. The measure is expected to be voted on by the Senate later today.

– The White House is kicking off a major initiative to boost teacher quality by tapping into the ranks of " master teachers," the term coined in 2001. The idea is to pair experienced teachers with those who are just starting out in their careers. The result is that the average teacher salary is now $53,000, but that could jump to $72,000 by 2015, reports the New York Times. The idea is to pair experienced teachers with those who are just starting out, and then keep them in the job for at least five more years. The pilot project is a joint effort by the Department of Education, the State Department of Education, and the White House Office of Education and Workforce Development. The White House is putting its money where its mouth is, however, with a goal of having 1,000 master teachers in the country by 2015. The idea is that they'll be able to better mentor other teachers, and that their own salaries will rise as a result. The Times notes that the program is a "big change" from the old model, which relied on teacher tenure.

– The US has a new health-care plan, but it's not exactly a radical one. President Obama has established a National Commission on the Advancement of Global Health, which will set the goal of "the global eradication of disease" by 2050, reports the New York Times. The commission will make recommendations to the president on how to achieve that goal, with the Times noting that the panel's 13 members will have to make some tough choices. Among them: whether to focus on vaccines and other preventative measures, or focus on medical research and treatments. The president has also asked the commission to look into the possibility of creating a national health insurance program, reports the Washington Post. The idea is that the private sector would take the lead on the latter, while the government would provide the medical care. The commission is expected to make its recommendations by the end of the year.

The department will first conduct a "top-to-bottom review" of the financial system, and will then set up a panel to oversee that review, reports the Wall Street Journal. The Treasury will also be required to provide quarterly reports to Congress on the progress of that review. The panel will also be given the power to subpoena documents and to make other requests, and will have the authority to make its own recommendations to Congress. The Journal notes that the move is likely to anger Republicans, who want to see more of the money spent on things like job training and education.

– The US and Canada have agreed to create a vast new wildlife refuge in the Arctic, a move that could have a big impact on the region's economy, the CBC reports. The 1.3-million-acre Northern Yukon-Arctic International Wildlife Refuge will be the biggest such refuge in the world, stretching from the Canadian Arctic to the Yukon Territory and stretching east to west as far as Greenland. It will be home to more than 90% of the world's grizzly bears, as well as more than half of the world's caribou, according to the Guardian. The Canadian government will pay for most of the construction and operation of the refuge, which will be managed by the US government. The US will pay for the rest. The agreement was announced by President Obama in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, on Friday, the Alaska Dispatch News reports. "This is a huge win for the people of Yukon," says one activist. "It's going to open up a huge area of the Arctic to more development." The Canadian government will pay for 80% of the construction costs, the US the rest. The US will pay for management of the refuge, which will be managed by the US Geological Survey. The agreement is expected to help the economies of both countries as the melting of the Arctic

– A new law is offering tax credits to military veterans who work in the renewable-energy industry, and it's drawing criticism from veterans groups who say it's a lousy idea. The law, which was signed into law by President Obama on Tuesday, offers a $1,000 tax credit for each new hire in the field, with a cap of $2,500, the New York Times reports. The law also requires companies to set aside 25% of their wages for veterans, and it gives companies a break on their federal taxes if they have workers from states that don't have taxes. The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which is opposed to the law, says it will "squander the opportunity to create jobs for our nation's veterans" and that it will "squander the money the government is already spending on veterans' benefits." The Defense Department has been pushing the law, which was included in the president's budget, to help vets find jobs in renewable energy fields, the Hill reports. "We need them to be here," says a Pentagon spokesman. "We need them to be prepared to do the job after they leave the military."

– "I'm not a big volunteer, but I want to do something for society." That's how 18-year-old college freshman Lauren Davis sees it. She's in the Army, and she wants to help. The Houston Chronicle reports Davis is one of more than 500,000 US troops who are expected to serve in the coming years as part of the National Service for Schools program. The idea is to get kids involved in service, which is meant to improve their odds of getting into college. "I think it's really cool," Davis tells the Chronicle. "I think it's going to help me be more self-disciplined, and I think it's going to help me be a better person." But the program isn't without its problems. Davis says she's never been offered a chance to do service, and she was "shocked" when she found out she was actually eligible. "I thought it was a joke," she says. "I thought it was a joke at first." The problem is that the program is so expensive—$1.2 billion a year—and schools are struggling. "I think it's a waste of money," says one Texas school official.

– The Justice Department has a new program to help rural police departments get the training and resources they need to do their jobs more effectively—and it's not exactly a TPS report. The National Center for Rural Law Enforcement was established by the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and it will be run by the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, reports the Washington Post. The center will include a training facility at the university, as well as a National Center for Rural Law Enforcement Advisory Board that will be made up of 15 members from state law enforcement agencies, including 10 from the FBI. The FBI will also have a presence at the center, and the director of the center will be appointed by the attorney general. The center will also work with the FBI to develop programs for rural officers, and it will help state and local law enforcement agencies to improve their own training and equipment, reports the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. But the center's director, who will be appointed by the attorney general, says he's not sure how the center will be funded, and he's not sure how many rural officers will be eligible for the program. "We're not going to be able to do everything we need to do," he says. "We're going to

– The CDC is warning parents that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is "not just for measles-stricken people," and it's not just for those who don't want their kids vaccinated. The warning comes after a measles case was reported in California this week, making it the state with the highest number of measles cases in the nation this year, reports the Los Angeles Times. At least 41 people have been infected, including two children who have been hospitalized. The CDC says the disease can be prevented by getting parents to vaccinate their kids, but some parents are balking at the cost of the vaccine, which runs about $130 for a single dose. "I don't believe that the vaccine is dangerous," a doctor in California tells the Times. "I think it's dangerous for other people, too." The CDC says parents who object to the vaccine should contact health officials. The New York Times reports that the California case shows that anti-vaxxers are still a big problem in the state, with thousands of parents refusing to have their kids vaccinated. The CDC says parents who object to the vaccine can get assistance through the federal government's "I am a vaccine mom" program, which provides free shots to kids in low-income areas. (

– The Pentagon is in danger of losing its lucrative contract to provide medical care for troops, and a new report from the Office of the Inspector General says it has a "serious problem" with the program, the Hill reports. The report, which is expected to be released today, says that the Pentagon has been outsourcing many civilian jobs to private firms and that the move has led to "serious oversight and accountability problems," reports the Washington Post. The report says that the Pentagon has been trying to cut costs by shifting many of its civilian employees to the private sector, and that the move has led to "a climate in which making accurate decisions concerning privatization and outsourcing are further complicated due to the dynamic nature of the civilian workforce." The report calls for a moratorium on privatization and outsourcing of all commercial or industrial functions of the Pentagon until the Pentagon finds a way to make them more efficient. The Pentagon has been under fire for years for outsourcing many jobs, including that of the medical unit at Fort Bliss, which was transferred to a defense contractor in 2009. The contractor, General Dynamics Medical Solutions, has been accused of shoddy work, fraud, and other problems, and has faced lawsuits from employees who say they were fired or forced to retire.

– When it comes to the Internal Revenue Code, it's all about the "net long-term capital gains" tax rate. But for investors who hold dividend stocks, that rate can be as high as 35%, and that's a problem, the Wall Street Journal reports. The problem is that the law allows investors to hold stock for so long as they don't realize the full net long-term capital gains rate, which the Journal explains is actually 35%. The problem is that the law doesn't take into account dividends, which are taxed at the capital gains rate. And the problem is that many investors hold stock for years at a time, and that can cause them to miss the full net long-term capital gains rate. "The law is designed to capture long-term capital gains, but it doesn't capture dividends," an analyst tells the Journal. "It's a tax that needs to be addressed." The IRS has a page on the matter in its 1986 tax code, and it explains that the tax rate on long-term capital gains is actually lower than the capital gains rate for investors who hold stock for a long time, but the rate is still 35% when the stock is sold for a profit. The Journal notes that the law is

– The Medicare payment system is in turmoil, and the Wall Street Journal reports that the Obama administration is about to announce a major overhaul to it. The move will require the government to create a new, more efficient way of calculating physician payments, one that takes into account not just the cost of care but also the quality of care. The Journal calls it "a radical shift" in how Medicare pays doctors, and it's not just because of the new formula. The old system relied on a fixed amount paid per visit. The new one will adjust those payments based on a set of criteria, and it's expected to save the government billions in the long run. The move is expected to be finalized in a matter of weeks. The problem is that the new formula doesn't take into account the fact that the way doctors bill the government is changing constantly. The Obama administration has been pushing for a faster system, and it's expected to be a major factor in how the Affordable Care Act is implemented.

– The CDC has been accused of bungling the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, but it's not the only agency that's bungled the rollout. The government has also been accused of bungling the rollout of the National Public Health Council, which was established under the Affordable Care Act to ensure that federal agencies are on the same page when it comes to public health issues, the Washington Post reports. The council was actually created by Congress in 2000—it's currently made up of the heads of the departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Interior, Homeland Security, Transportation, Energy, and more—but the Obama administration has been slow to establish it, the Post notes. The president has reportedly been told to get the council up and running by the end of this year. The council will be tasked with reviewing the Affordable Care Act, as well as other public health programs, to make sure they're working as smoothly as possible. But the council's head, Dr. Nancy Seltzer, says the agency has been "slow to get started" and that the council will be "an important tool in helping the president make decisions about the Affordable Care Act." She says the council will also help the president make decisions about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act

– The Obama administration is offering a big tax break to companies that make energy-efficient buildings a reality, the New York Times reports. Under a new law, businesses can claim up to 30% of the cost of energy-efficient projects on their federal tax returns. The credit is available to any company that makes a "significant investment" in energy-efficient buildings, according to the IRS. The law was signed into law in 2009, but it's only now getting attention. "It's like a new tax credit," says an analyst. "It's a nice perk, but it's not a huge money-maker." The law gives businesses a break of up to 35% of the cost of energy-efficient buildings, which the Times notes is a big difference from the old rule, which gave the companies a maximum of 50%. The Obama administration says the new law will help more than 50,000 businesses save billions of dollars in energy costs over the next decade.

– The US Army Corps of Engineers has approved a controversial plan to spend $20 million to fix a major problem with the Mississippi River. The plan to build a $7 million dam on the river near Jackson, Miss., has been controversial from the start, with critics saying it will cause massive flooding and possibly damage the Statue of Liberty, reports the Clarion-Ledger. The Army Corps of Engineers, however, says the project is necessary to prevent a major flood and will reduce the amount of water going into the river, which is already saturated withidaemic bacteria. The project has been approved by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, the US Geological Survey, and the US Forest Service, reports the AP. The Forest Service says the project will not affect the national wildlife refuge that surrounds the river. The Army Corps of Engineers says the project will be completed by 2024. The project was approved by the US Senate last week, but the House has yet to approve it. The Forest Service says it will review the plan before commenting. The project is expected to be completed by 2024. (The feds have been cracking down on pollution in the Mississippi.)

– The Department of Transportation is offering Amtrak a $2 billion loan guarantee to help it build a new train station in Washington state, the AP reports. The announcement comes after the station was identified as a top priority in the department's rail modernization plan. The project is expected to cost the government an additional $15 billion, according to the Washington Post. Amtrak, which is planning to build the station in the Cascades area, has applied for the loan guarantee. The company says it will use the money to buy new rail cars, locomotives, and other equipment. The loan guarantee is part of a larger program to provide loans for rail projects. The Department of Transportation says the new train station will be the first in the nation with a "high-speed" rail line. The project is expected to cost the government an additional $15 billion.

– The payroll tax cut that took effect Jan. 1 is a lousy idea, according to critics who say it will hurt the poor and middle class. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times round up some of the arguments against the measure, which provides a $1,000 credit for workers who are newly unemployed. The credit is intended to help people who have been out of work for a year or more, and critics say it will help only the rich. "This is a bad, bad idea," says one New York state senator. "It’s going to hurt the poor the most." The law is "basically a tax cut for the rich," says a Washington-based analyst. "It’s going to help the poor the most, but it’s not going to help the middle class as much as it should." The law is "basically a tax cut for the rich," says a New York state lawmaker. "It’s a tax cut for the wealthy, but it’s not a tax cut for the poor." The law is also set to extend for another year the Earned Income Tax Credit, which helps workers who have had to leave their jobs due to illness or disability.

– The US military spends some $5 billion a year on overseas bases—and it doesn't have to. That's because the countries that host US troops pay a fair share. But that doesn't mean they should be paying a lot more than they should, according to a new report from the Center for American Progress. The report finds that the US would have saved about $5,000 million if the countries of its allies had paid at least 75% of the cost, the Washington Post reports. Germany, Italy, the UK, and Japan all contributed at least 20% of the cost in 1992, and Japan paid 70%. But the US doesn't want to negotiate such a deal, and the report says the Pentagon should instead ask Congress for a law that would require them to pay at least 75%. "It is in the national interest of the United States for the United States to enter into burden sharing support agreements that provide for such allies to defray most or all of the overseas basing costs," the report states. The Center for American Progress says the law would be a "win-win" for both nations: It would mean more money for the US to pay for its troops, and it would allow Japan to continue to contribute while also allowing it to continue to train and equip the US forces

– The Supreme Court has ruled that corporate donors can't take part in political campaigns, and the ruling has big implications for the 2016 presidential race. The ruling revolves around a little-known section of the Federal Election Act called Section 527, which allows corporate donors to give as much as $1,000 to candidates, political parties, and other groups. The ruling says that while corporate donors can still donate to candidates, they can't do so to political parties, reports the New York Times. The case could have big implications for the 2016 race because, as the Times points out, the law allows unlimited donations from corporations to candidates. The ruling "could be a game-changer," says one campaign finance expert. "It could open up a whole new way of doing politics." The law was written in the 1970s, but it's been updated in the last 30 years, and the changes have made it easier for corporations to donate to candidates. The law also allows unlimited contributions from groups called "major organizations," which include labor unions and other big players in the political arena. For example, the pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC Correct the Record has raised more than $1 million from more than 1,000 donors since 2010 and plans to raise another $1 million before the election.

– A bill that would end the Israeli military's practice of detaining Palestinian children passed the House of Representatives on Tuesday, the AP reports. The measure, which would end the practice by 2017, passed 302-126, with 38 Republicans in favor and just 11 Democrats. It would also require the State Department to report to Congress on the issue every year. The military has been using the practice for about a decade, according to Al Jazeera, and it's been criticized by human rights groups. The bill was introduced by Rep. George Miller, a California Democrat, and co-sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren. It would also require the State Department to report on the issue every year. Miller says the detentions violate Israel's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. "It's time to end this horrible practice," he tells the AP.

– The New York State Police are taking a hard look at their own department after a report that one of its officers was found to be carrying a gun on him. The report, which the New York Times says was issued to the department by the NYPD's internal affairs office, says that after the officer was found with a gun on him, he was questioned by police and told he had a concealed-carry permit. The officer, who retired in 2014, was given a warning for the gun, but it's not clear whether that was the cause of the incident. The Times notes that the officer was cleared to carry the gun by the state police academy, which is required by law to investigate all reports of officer-related incidents. The NYPD says it will review the report and determine whether the officer should be disciplined. The Times notes that the New York State Police is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the country, with about 5,000 officers. The New York City Police Department, meanwhile, is reviewing its policies on officers carrying guns after a similar incident in which a cop was shot and killed while off duty. (In other gun-control news, a bill that would have required background checks for gun buyers is winding its way through Congress.)

– When it comes to teacher pay, the state of California has a special exemption for those who make more than $250,000 a year. But that doesn't mean teachers can afford to go to grad school. The exemption is available to those who make between $32,500 and $120,000 a year, which is about half of what teachers make in California, reports the Los Angeles Times. The exemption applies to those who earn between $32,500 and $120,000, which is about half of what teachers make in California. But that doesn't mean teachers can't afford to go to grad school. "I think it's a good thing, because it allows us to be more prepared," says a teacher in San Jose who makes $32,500. "It's a good way to stay ahead of the game." The exemption is available to those who earn between $32,500 and $120,000 a year, which is about half of what teachers make in California. But it doesn't apply to those who make more than that. Teachers who make more than that can claim the full $250,000 exemption, but that doesn't apply to those who make more than that.

– The Washington Post is out with a list of the top 10 health insurance plans, and it's a doozy: The top five, based on cost to the taxpayer: Humana, $3,350; Kaiser Permanente, $3,350; Blue Cross and Blue Shield of California, $3,300; Tufts Health Plan, $3,300; and Anthem, $3,300. The list is based on a new IRS rule that allows individuals to save money on their health insurance premiums by opening medical savings accounts. The upshot: People who think they're saving money on health insurance might be surprised to find out that they're actually saving money on their taxes, reports the Wall Street Journal. The rule, which took effect in January, allows individuals to save up to 7.5% of their annual income on health insurance premiums. The Journal notes that the rule is likely to be popular with self-employed people, who typically make far less on health insurance than full-time workers. The savings could be used for medical expenses, but it's not clear how much that could cost the government. The law is based on a 1986 IRS rule that limited the number of medical savings accounts individuals could open. The Journal notes that the rule was eventually repealed, but it's

– The CDC is in need of 332 million doses of vaccines for the current flu season, and it's running out of space, reports the Wall Street Journal. The agency has set a goal of 471 million doses, but it's running out of room, and it's asking Congress for $5 billion to buy more. The money would come from the Social Security Administration, which has a budget of $5.3 billion. The problem is that the money is in a special account that the agency doesn't use, and the money is coming from a different account at the VA. "We're running out of vaccines," says a CDC official. "We're not getting any more vaccines." The VA's inspector general is looking into the problem, and the story quotes a letter from the acting director of the VA to Congress that says the agency has enough vaccines for the current season, but it needs to buy another 120 million doses if it wants to avoid a repeat of the flu season in the fall. The Journal notes that the problem isn't unique to the VA. The CDC ran out of vaccines in the fall of 2005 after a huge increase in demand, and the problem only worsened after the 2005-2006 flu season.

– The EPA has been trying to clean up the abandoned factories that dot the Detroit area for decades, but the effort has run into problems. The agency has been handing out grants to developers to clean up the buildings, but critics say the money is being doled out too quickly and at a time when job training and environmental cleanup programs are already stretched to the limit, the Detroit Free Press reports. The problem is that the money is often doled out through the EPA's Superfund program, which was created in the 1970s to clean up toxic waste in the wake of theignitedignite fire that devastated the area. The EPA says it has distributed more than $2 billion in grants to date, but critics say that's not enough to clean up the thousands of properties that have been deemed "brownfield" sites, meaning they're contaminated with toxic chemicals. "The money is going to the most contaminated sites, and the most contaminated sites are in the most poor neighborhoods," says a former EPA official. "And that's not good." The problem is that the money is often doled out to developers who have no plans to clean up the properties, and the result is that the projects are often delayed or canceled. "The money is going to the most contaminated sites

– If you're in a bar or concert venue, you may want to consider getting a wireless microphone—because the FCC is about to start requiring it, the Hill reports. The rule, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will require bands designated for TV broadcasts to be kept separate from those used for wireless audio. And it will require bands to be "safe havens" for users, the FCC says. The rule is based on a 2013 law that made it illegal to use wireless microphones at " venues where TV broadcasting is allowed." The FCC says it will "expANDING the scope of service rule" to include "live or recorded events and performances," the Hill reports. The rule will require bands to be kept separate from those used for wireless audio, but it's not clear how the FCC will enforce the change. The agency says it will "comply with any requests it receives from broadcasters to ensure that the bands are kept separate." The agency also says it will require bands to be kept separate from those used for wireless audio "where there is a reasonable possibility that interference from such interference will cause a person to experience unacceptable sound quality." The FCC says it will also require bands to be kept separate from those used for wireless audio "where there is a reasonable possibility

– The Trump administration is making it easier for farmers to get federal money to do things like improve their water quality, USA Today reports. The Environmental Quality Incentive Program, or EQIP, is a federal program that gives farmers money to do things like install drought-tolerant crops, reduce runoff, and more. But the program has run into problems in the past, and the White House is now changing the rules to make it easier for farmers to get money to do those things, according to the Hill. The old rules required farmers to put in 75% of the costs associated with their practices, but the new ones say that figure must be at least 40%. The new rules also now require farmers to put in 100% of the costs, or at least part of it, for things like building wetlands. The Obama administration had been letting farmers put in only 40% of the costs, but the new rules will require them to put in 100%. One farmer in Iowa who had been trying to get money to install drought-tolerant crops says he's "shocked" at the new rules. "It's kind of mind-boggling that they're giving us 100% of the costs," he says. "It's just mind-boggling." Another Iowa farmer says he's worried about

– The White House has announced a major shift in its push to develop alternative energy sources, one that could see the US become a "major player" in the burgeoning field. President Obama signed a bill into law on Wednesday that calls for the Department of Energy to work more closely with private companies to develop clean energy technologies, including nuclear fusion and wind power, the New York Times reports. "The president's action reflects his commitment to building a new energy economy that is clean, affordable, and spurs innovation," the White House said in a statement. The bill calls for the department to work more closely with universities and other organizations to develop technologies, and it gives the department until 2018 to find a suitable partner and build a demonstration facility, the Times notes. The bill is expected to help the US move closer to building a nuclear power industry that could create millions of jobs, the Times notes.

– When a Florida woman filed a lawsuit against her ex-boyfriend for allegedly beating her, she didn't expect to get a response. But when she got a call from a lawyer, she was surprised to learn that the state had passed a law in 2011 that prohibits domestic violence victims from being denied insurance because of their crime, the Miami Herald reports. The law, which the state's insurance commissioner signed in April, makes it a crime "to deny, cancel, or limit health insurance coverage or health benefits" for a person because of domestic violence or other "prior condition" (the Herald notes the law doesn't cover pre-existing conditions). The woman's ex-boyfriend, Jonathan Van Duzer, was charged with felony domestic violence in the incident, which allegedly happened in October 2011. The law's language is broad, and it applies to anyone who is physically or sexually abused in their capacity as a parent, spouse, or intimate partner. The law's language also makes it a crime to "knowingly" cause or intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly cause bodily injury, rape, or involuntary sexual intercourse, and to "subject another to false imprisonment." The law's language is "inconsistent with the Affordable Care Act and the federal Victim

– A new law is designed to help young farmers get into the business of farming, and it's a little complicated to get started. The Young and Beginning Farmers Act of 2018—which President Trump signed into law on Friday—calls for the USDA to set up a website where farmers can apply for loans and other assistance, and it gives the government the power to sell off surplus farm equipment to farmers or ranchers in need, the Washington Post reports. The idea is to help younger farmers get started and avoid the "serious financial problems" that can come with starting a farm, the New York Times reports. "It's a way to get them started and get them on their own," says Rep. Steve Stockman, a Republican from Iowa, which is home to the largest number of young farmers in the country. The law also calls for the USDA to work with universities to help farmers start businesses, and it gives the government the power to buy farmland if necessary. But it's not all good news for young farmers. The law also calls for the USDA to do more to help older farmers, and it requires that farmers who are selling farmland to be in good standing with the government. But the law doesn't actually require the government to buy the land, and farmers

– A construction project in North Carolina has caused a major environmental disaster, and now state officials are taking action. The News & Observer reports that the US Army Corps of Engineers is investigating the cause of the massive amount of water that poured into a storm drain near the intersection of Interstate 75 and US Route 17. The drain is supposed to hold water during heavy rains, but it filled with so much that it caused a major storm surge that damaged homes, businesses, and infrastructure. The problem is that the drain was built to hold water during periods of heavy rain, but it was filled so much that it caused the storm surge to increase. The National Weather Service says the surge was caused by "exceptionally heavy rainfall" in the region. The Army Corps of Engineers is looking into the problem and has issued a report that will be released in the coming weeks. The newspaper notes that the problem is so widespread that the US Forest Service has asked for help in preventing similar problems. “We’re trying to get the word out,” says a Forest Service spokesman. “We’re trying to get people to understand the issue.” The Forest Service says it will work with the NC Department of Transportation to figure out how to fix the problem.

– A pregnant US veteran who went to the ER at Texas Children's Hospital to be treated for a potentially life-threatening pregnancy condition was turned away by the ER staff and sent back to the ER—where she was told she'd have to wait three days for treatment, the Houston Chronicle reports. The woman, identified as RN Desiree Hines, gave birth to a baby girl on Oct. 10, and the hospital says she was told she'd have to wait until Friday to be treated. "They said they couldn't wait three days," Hines tells ABC News. "They said they couldn't treat me if I was three days pregnant." The hospital says it's following the Department of Veterans Affairs' policy of not transferring patients to emergency departments if they're pregnant or in labor, the Chronicle reports. "We're just trying to do the right thing," Hines says. "I'm not pregnant. I'm not having a baby. I'm not pregnant." The VA says it's working to change its policy, but Hines says she's not sure she'll be able to get treatment in Texas. "I'm not going to go to Texas and be treated the way they treated me," she says.

– The Justice Department is set to announce a major new initiative today designed to reduce violence in schools, and it's going to be a big one. The department is directing $50 million to 31 states to help prevent violence at schools, reports the Washington Post. The money is part of a larger effort to reduce crime in schools, and the idea is to get kids involved in decision-making early. "It's a very powerful thing to have them involved in the decision-making process," says a DOJ official. The effort is being led by the department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The money is being doled out under the 1994 Safe Schools Act, and the idea is to get kids involved in decision-making early, even if they're not currently in school. The idea is to give them a voice, and to help them make choices that lead to positive outcomes. The program is being rolled out in the wake of the Connecticut school shooting, and the Post notes that the funding is being hailed as a big deal because it's the first time the feds are putting money toward preventing violence in schools. (The Justice Department has been doing a lot more of it lately.)

– The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area, which includes more than 8,500 square miles of Louisiana, is now protected by the federal government—and some locals are worried it could be ruined by oil companies. The land, which includes sections of the Mississippi River and stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of Mexico, is "one of the last remnants of the pre-European world," a US Geological Survey official tells the New York Times. "It's a place where people lived, worked, and died." The area, which was designated a national heritage area in 2004, contains "significant resource values and functions," including "a complex mixture of people and their origins, traditions, customs, beliefs, and folkways of interest to the public," according to the USGS. Oil companies have been drilling there for decades, and the USGS says they've damaged or destroyed more than 200 structures, including homes, churches, and stores. "The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area is one of the last remnants of the pre-European world, and it's in danger of being destroyed by the oil industry," a local historian tells the Times.

– The federal government has extended the unemployment benefits of more than 2 million Americans—but the process is proving to be a bureaucratic nightmare for some. The extended benefits—which last for an average of 99 weeks—were put in place after the 1993 economic crisis, but many Americans have had to wait years to collect them, the Wall Street Journal reports. The extended benefits, which last for an average of 99 weeks, were put in place after the crash of the Amtrak train disaster and the subsequent recession. The Journal notes that the extended benefits were supposed to last until the end of September, but that many people who lost their jobs during the crash have had to wait longer. The extended benefits—which last for an average of 99 weeks—were included in the stimulus bill that President Obama signed into law last month. But the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the extension will cost about $175 billion, making it one of the biggest spending bills of the Obama administration. The White House has called the extension a "silly" move that will "short-circuit the recovery," but lawmakers, including Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, say they want to see more of it extended.

"The money should be spent on prevention," says Rep. Peter King, a New York Democrat who introduced the bill. "We need to do more than just add chemicals to the mix." The bill's supporters say the money will help fight a disease that has been shown to be caused by exposure to chemicals like pesticides, hormones, and radiation. The projects will be concentrated in eight areas, including breast cancer, environmental health, and climate change. The EPA says it will work with the American Cancer Society to make sure the projects are on track.

The old rules required companies to do so, but the new ones will require them to do so within 30 days.

– A 4-year-old Texas girl who was declared brain-dead at age 3 has made history as the youngest person ever to receive a transplant from an outside donor. The girl, identified only as Jane Doe, was given a kidney from a Canadian family in 1997 and donated to Children's Hospital Los Angeles in 2000. She was declared brain-dead at age 4. In 2014, the transplant was performed by a Canadian company, and Jane Doe's mother, Jane Doe Jr., was told her daughter was brain-dead in May. The Houston Chronicle reports the transplant was performed on June 10, 2015, and that the girl was declared brain-dead on June 16. The transplant was a surprise because Jane Doe had been declared brain-dead by the Texas Department of Health in May. The department said the transplant was performed under a new federal law that allows states to set up "streamlined" enrollment processes for children who are too young to receive Medicaid or Medicare. The law allows states to set up streamlined processes for out-of-state providers who are deemed "medically eligible" but who aren't in Texas. Jane Doe was enrolled in Texas' Medicaid program but was not covered by it. She was given a choice between two transplant options, one from a Texas company

– If you're looking to save money on your heating and air conditioning bill, you may want to consider a system that has an Energy Star rating. But that rating may not be as important as you think. A new federal law will require manufacturers of heating and air conditioning equipment to have their systems certified by an independent third party before they can sell to the public, the Wall Street Journal reports. The law, which took effect in March, is part of President Obama's effort to reduce carbon emissions, and it will require manufacturers to submit their systems to the government for testing. The Energy Star rating is given to products that meet certain energy efficiency standards. But the law will also require manufacturers to submit their systems to an independent third party every year to verify they're up to snuff. "We're going to put a lot of pressure on them to make sure their systems are up to snuff," says a spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers. The association estimates that if all manufacturers had to submit their systems to the government for testing, they could save up to 30% on their energy bills. But critics say the law will make it harder for consumers to choose the best system for their needs. "The only thing that's going to make people buy a system that

– The American Military Retirees Association is a nonprofit that was federally chartered in 1986—and it's now the largest veterans advocacy group in the country, with more than 550,000 members, the Hill reports. But the group's biggest push is to get Congress to actually pass legislation that would protect the military's pensions, which are guaranteed by the federal government. "We're trying to get the word out that the benefits are available to the retirees," says its president, a retired Army colonel. "We're trying to get the word out that the benefits are available to the retirees." That means lobbying in Washington, DC, and on the local level to get legislation passed that would protect the pensions. But Congress has been less than forthcoming with its requests, and the group's lobbying efforts have been going nowhere. "We're trying to get them to take us seriously," says the Hill's Michael Daly. "We're trying to get them to take us seriously enough to actually do something about it."

– The Obama administration is cracking down on for-profit hospitals, and the Consumerist has the details on how it's being done. The move comes after the federal government found that for-profit hospitals were siphoning off money that should be going to nonprofit hospitals. Specifically, the feds found that for-profit hospitals were buying up assets of nonprofit hospitals, then using those assets to pay for things like "out-of-state" patients who got treated at for-profit hospitals, or patients who received care at for-profit hospitals that were treated at nonprofit hospitals. The feds also found that for-profit hospitals were paying for things like patient transportation to get patients to the hospital, or for-profit hospitals to pay for things like patient care while the nonprofit hospital was being used for other purposes. The problem, as the Washington Post explains, is that nonprofit hospitals are required by law to keep their assets in house, and for-profit hospitals don't have that option. The Obama administration is now trying to change that, and the Department of Health and Human Services is issuing guidelines to help make sure that happens. The rules are here.

The commission will also be given the authority to recommend programs to the president. The order was signed just as the White House was unveiling its plan to reduce gun violence. Obama's plan includes a major push to reduce the glorification of gun violence in movies and video games, as well as to increase access to mental health services. The president's plan also includes a major expansion of after-school programs.

– You're not going to believe this, but you can drive across the border from Mexico without having to worry about getting pulled over for smog. That's because a 1998 law prohibits "non noncommercial motor vehicles" from crossing the border into the US unless they're registered in a foreign country and operated by a US citizen or permanent resident, reports the Los Angeles Times. The law was meant to curb pollution from cars coming in from Mexico, but it's actually been used to curb pollution from trucks coming in from Canada, reports the New York Times. The Obama administration has been trying to get Mexico to curb the pollution, and Mexico has been complying. But the Mexican government says the law is unconstitutional and it will fight any attempt to enforce it, reports the Times. The law is "an overreach by the US government that will have a significant impact on air quality in areas affected by pollution from Mexican vehicles," says a spokesman for the Environmental Working Group. The law is also "inconsistent with international agreements on the curbing of pollution from vehicles," he says. The rule is set to take effect in January, and critics say it will drive away foreign-registered cars and put an end to a popular tourist attraction in the Mexican border city of Tijuana. (See

– The US Air Force Sergeants Association is in a legal fight with the Air Force over a flag it wants to fly on Capitol Hill. The group wants to fly the flag in honor of fallen service members, but the Air Force Times reports that it's in violation of a 1989 law that says the flag "shall be in a manner designed to ensure visibility to the public." The Washington Post explains that the law was written to prevent the US military from using the flag as a "trophy" for its personnel. The group says it's trying to put up a more fitting flag, and it's been fighting the Air Force for months to get it on the Hill. The group says it's not trying to disrespect the law, but it wants the Air Force to have the same freedom to choose which flag to fly. The Air Force Times reports that the group's president, Staff Sgt. 1st Class Mark Williams, has been in a fight with the Air Force over the past few years. He was kicked out of the DC chapter of the association in 2014 for refusing to wear a patch identifying him as a black service member, and he filed a discrimination lawsuit against the Air Force in 2015. The lawsuit says the Air Force has been using the flag as a "

– The feds are taking heat for giving Social Security recipients hefty pensions without any sacrifice to the recipients. The Washington Post reports that the Social Security Administration has been giving out pensions worth an average of $115,000 a year to thousands of people who retired between 1980 and 2011. The problem is that the Social Security Administration doesn't actually pay the pensions, but it does give employees access to the money through the Thrift Savings Plan, which is managed by the feds. The problem is that the Social Security Administration doesn't actually pay the pensions, but it gives the employees who do access the money access to the savings plan.

– The US is about to lose a lot of manufacturing jobs. The House has voted to slash some import duties on steel and aluminum, reports the Hill. The vote was 289-233, with 23 Republicans in favor and just two Democrats. The move is part of the American ManufacturingCompetitiveness Act of 2015, which calls for the elimination of duties on goods made in the US and "creates artificial distortions in the economy of the United States that negatively affect United States manufacturers and consumers," per the House website. The move is designed to help US manufacturers compete more effectively and to prevent what the White House calls "a decades-long unfair trade policy that has hurt US manufacturers." The move will save about $12 billion a year in import duties, the Washington Post reports.

– The Cherokee Nation has been fighting for years to have the federal government stop taxing their reservation—and now it's finally getting its wish. The Cherokee Nation has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services, claiming the department has been violating a 1986 law that prohibits the taxation of reservation income, the Washington Post reports. The lawsuit states that the department has been distributing money from the Indian Health Service—which provides health care to some 700,000 Cherokees—to nonprofit groups that distribute diapers to low-income families. The Department of Health and Human Services, however, says the money is being distributed only to groups that provide diapers to infants and toddlers. The lawsuit states that the department has been distributing money to groups that provide diapers to children of non- Cherokee families, and it states that the department has also been distributing money to groups that provide diapers to children of non- Cherokee families but have no proof of success. The lawsuit states that the department has been distributing money to groups that provide diapers to children of non- Cherokee families but have no proof of success.

– The Supreme Court has ruled that governments can use the power of eminent domain to seize homes and businesses for use in the public interest. And now Congress has responded. The House today passed the Protection of Homes, Small Businesses, and Private Property Act, which, among other things, requires that eminent domain be used only "for public use," reports the Hill. The law was introduced in 2005 after the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Kelo v. City of New London, which ruled that the government could seize homes and businesses only for the purpose of paying a price. (The court did, however, say that the government could only take property for "public use" if it was "just compensation.") The act is a response to that 2005 decision, and its supporters say it will protect homes and businesses from being taken for "just compensation." But opponents, including the ACLU, say the law will make it easier for governments to seize homes and businesses for development purposes. "The takings power will be employed more frequently," they say. "The takings power will disproportionately affect and harm the economically disadvantaged and, in particular, racial and ethnic minorities and the elderly."

– The US is about to send its first troops to Uganda in more than two decades to help end a brutal rebel group that has terrorized the country for more than two decades. The troops will be stationed in the country's north to train government forces and to protect humanitarian workers, reports the Washington Post. The Obama administration has been trying to end the fighting between the Lord's Resistance Army and the government for years, but the troops will be the first American troops to go to Uganda sinceGorillas were sent there in 1993. The Democratic senator who introduced the measure in the Senate says the troops will be a "modest" move, but it will be a big step toward ending the LRA's reign of terror. "We are not going to solve the Lord's Resistance Army problem by sending more American troops," he tells the New York Times. "We are going to get it done."

– The White House has released its long-awaited national security strategy, and it's not going over well with some lawmakers. The 10-year plan, which President Obama will unveil in a speech today, is expected to lay out the government's strategy for countering terrorism and other threats to the US, reports the Washington Post. The plan includes a major focus on China, which the White House says is a growing threat because of its authoritarian government and its ability to meddle in other countries' internal affairs. The plan also focuses on Russia, Iran, and North Korea, which the Post notes are "seemingly more advanced" than al-Qaeda in their efforts to attack the US. The plan calls for a stepped-up effort by the government and private sector to counter such threats, and it calls for more aggressive anti-terror efforts in China, reports the New York Times. The plan also calls for more aggressive efforts at home, including more police and anti-terror training for Americans.

– The IRS is offering a $5,000 tax credit to people who bought or renovated homes that were damaged by a natural disaster in 2011. The law is called the Natural Disaster Mitigation Act of 2011, and it gives tax credits to homeowners who make "qualified natural disaster mitigation property expenditures" on their properties, such as adding stronger roofs or creating a water barrier, the Los Angeles Times reports. The law was signed by President Obama in 2011, and the Times notes that it's not clear how many people qualify. The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that there are about 85,000 "qualified natural disaster mitigation property expenditures" on behalf of taxpayers, according to the IRS. The average cost of such expenditures is about $12,000. The law was signed as part of the Obama administration's efforts to reduce the amount of federal taxes paid by the middle class, the Times notes.

– A man who was arrested for allegedly punching a cop in the face and threatening to kill another officer was able to communicate with the officer using a computer program, the New York Daily News reports. The incident happened in May in New York City's Central Park, where the officer was sitting in his patrol car. The man was arrested after he allegedly punched the cop in the face and threatened to kill him. The officer was shaken up and released on bail. The New York City Police Department says the man was arrested for spitting on the officer, who was sitting in his patrol car, and for threatening to kill another officer. The incident was reported to the FBI, which is investigating. The man was arrested for spitting on the officer and for making criminal threats, according to a police report. The officer was also cited for spitting on a woman who was in his patrol car. The NYPD says the man was arrested for spitting on a police officer's uniform and for threatening to kill a police officer. The incident happened in a part of New York City that has a large Hispanic population, and the police department says it wants to make sure people who speak other languages get a fair shake in court.

– The US government has granted Shell a 10-year lease to drill for oil on the US' outer Continental Shelf—a move the company says is in the "national interest of the United States." But critics say the move is part of a pattern of expanding US offshore drilling, and they're not happy about it. The US and other countries consider the shelf to be off-limits to drilling because of Iran's support of terrorism and other issues. The government says the lease was granted in accordance with the Iran Sanctions Act, which bans US companies from doing business with Iran, the New York Times reports. "The president has made it clear that the United States does not want to do business with Iran in any way, shape, or form," a US Interior Department spokesman says. "We are simply extending the time that companies have to disclose their Iranian business partners." The US government has granted more than 50 similar leases in the Gulf of Mexico and off-shore Alaska since last year, the Times notes. The US government says it's not sure how many wells Shell will be able to drill on the shelf, but the company says it plans to do so anyway, the Washington Post reports.

– A whistleblower who filed a class-action lawsuit against BMW over alleged safety defects in its cars will receive more than $3 million, the company has announced. The suit was filed in August by plaintiff Christopher Hendron, who says he was fired from his job as a software engineer in July 2014 after reporting a problem with the company's popular i8 supercar to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the New York Daily News reports. According to the suit, Hendron reported the problem to BMW's quality department on at least two occasions, but the company didn't act on his complaints until after he filed the lawsuit. TheNHTSA investigated the issue and determined that the i8 was safe, but Hendron says the agency didn't act because it was concerned about the company's reputation. "I was fired for reporting a safety issue that was not a safety issue," Hendron tells the Daily News. "I was fired for reporting a problem that was not a safety issue." The suit seeks more than $3 million in damages, plus interest. Hendron says he was fired for reporting the problem, but the company didn't respond to his request for comment. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has received more than 50 complaints about the i8 since September 2014,

– The US government is ramping up its efforts to help kids with "gifted" abilities, with the Department of Education announcing a new program that will give schools up to $50 million to help students with such abilities, the Washington Post reports. The money is part of a larger effort to expand the program, which Congress passed in 2003 to help kids from diverse backgrounds who might not otherwise be able to get an education. The new program will focus on helping students who are already gifted—those who have mastered 35% to 50% of the material in certain areas—and those who are even more gifted, such as those who are in the top 10% of their grade level in certain areas. The money will go to states, which can choose to dole out grants of up to $5 million per year. The grants will help schools develop programs that focus on the gifted and Talented Student Act of 2003's findings that gifted and talented students "give evidence of high performance capability in specific academic fields, or in areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership." The program will also help kids with disabilities, as well as those who come from low-income or rural areas. The grants will be awarded to states based on their Gifted and Talented Student Performance Index, which the Post notes is based

– The UN is looking to get its arms around a new proposal from the European Union to create a rapid-deployment force that could be ready to go within a month of a Security Council resolution. The plan would see the EU—which currently has no military presence in the UN—work with the US to create brigades of up to 4,000 troops each, which would be stationed in countries that have requested them and would be able to respond to threats from other nations, the BBC reports. The US would then have the power to veto any Security Council resolution that would impede the force's deployment. The plan would be a major shift for the UN, which has long relied on last-minute troop and police deployments. The US backed out of a similar plan in 2000 over concerns about its ability to provide for rapid deployment, but the EU has been pushing for a force since at least 2005, the BBC notes. The plan would also give the EU the ability to halt any deployment of UN forces if it doesn't meet the group's standards, which include being able to restore peace and avoid war, among other things.

– The FCC is in the midst of a massive spectrum overhaul that will see the government take over much of the wireless airwaves used by carriers like Verizon and AT&T. The agency has set a goal of shifting to a "user-pays" system, meaning that carriers will pay the government to take over their airwaves and hand over the money to the government when they're done, reports the Wall Street Journal. The agency says the move will save the government billions in spectrum-related costs, but critics say it's a way to shift the entire industry to a single, monopolized band. "This is a way to basically turn the entire industry on its head," says a former FCC official. The agency says the move will save the government billions in spectrum costs, but critics say it will make things harder for consumers who have to pay more for service. The plan is expected to cost the government up to $5 billion, reports the New York Times. The plan also could affect other government agencies, including the Coast Guard, which has to switch to a different band for navigation. (Verizon is in the midst of a huge legal battle over its wireless patents.)

– The White House has announced a plan to send the US territory of Puerto Rico its own "Fiscal Cliff" to deal with its fiscal crisis, the AP reports. The plan, which the White House says will help the island deal with its $74 billion debt, would allow Puerto Rico to create its own budget and tax code, among other things. It would also allow the island to sell bonds to pay its debts. The move comes as Puerto Rico's government has been warning that the island's government is in deep financial trouble. The island has been without a budget for more than a year. The White House says it will help the island create its own fiscal cliff plan, which would allow it to begin talks with Congress on a budget and possibly a debt ceiling. The island's government has said it will not allow the federal government to negotiate on its behalf. The White House says it will work with Puerto Rico to create a process for the island to determine its political status. The island is currently a US commonwealth, and the US Constitution states that the territory "shall be determined by the Congress of the United States." But Puerto Rico's government has said it will allow a referendum on statehood or independence, and the island's governor has said he will allow a

– The NRA is taking on what it calls a "deceptive" industry that sells "kits" that make it easy to convert an assault weapon into a more powerful weapon with no disassembling required. The kits, which can be purchased online or at gun shows, come with a universal magazine that can hold more than 30 rounds, but they're not allowed to be sold alongside other guns, NBC News reports. The "kits" are made of high-quality components and can be purchased for as little as $25 on eBay, but the NRA says they're illegal under federal law. "These kits are a deceptive business practice that violates the spirit and letter of the law," the NRA's top lawyer says. "They are not legal." The kit can be purchased at gun shows or online, but the NRA says it will not accept sales of the kits at its annual convention in Las Vegas this weekend. The NRA says it will fight any attempt to ban the kits, which it says are a "distraction" from the real problem of gun violence. "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun," the NRA's top lawyer tells the Washington Post. "If the NRA doesn't get its act together

– The US government has spent more than $100 million on trips to Cuba over the past 20 years—and it's not for propaganda purposes. Instead, the trips are meant to educate Americans on the communist nation's history and culture, the New York Times reports. The State Department says the trips are necessary because Cuba is "technically" still an independent country, but critics say the US is sending a message to Cuba that it doesn't care about democracy or human rights. "The purpose of these programs is to inform the American people about the history and culture of Cuba," says Rep. Peter King, a New York Democrat who has introduced a bill to cut the trips in half. The State Department says the money is for "educational and cultural exchange programs," not propaganda purposes, and it has "zero tolerance" for "misguided or deceptive" propaganda, the Washington Post reports. The State Department says it has sent more than 20,000 people to Cuba since the 1960s, and it has also hosted more than 1,000 Cubans in the US. The trip to Cuba cost $26.4 million in 1995, according to the latest available figures, and the State Department says it has spent more than $100 million on other trips since then. The State Department says it has no plans to cut

– A new law will provide for free child care for veterans who receive mental health care—and it's a welcome move for advocates who say veterans often struggle to find affordable care, the Hill reports. The law, which President Trump signed into law on Friday, will provide up to $3,000 per month for a veteran's child to cover the cost of in-home care or in-home care at a licensed child care center. The money will be available to veterans who receive mental health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Department of Defense, and who are in the "high-need" category. "It's a big deal because it's the first time that we're going to be providing free child care to veterans," says Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who introduced the bill in the House. "It's a big deal because it's going to help a lot of veterans who are in the high-need category." The law is part of Trump's $1.1 trillion spending plan, which includes billions for infrastructure projects, reports the New York Times.

– The Cherokee Nation is suing Walmart for allegedly violating a federal law that prohibits Native American tribes from selling cigarettes to non-members, the AP reports. The suit claims Walmart violated the 2010 Indian Removal Act by selling cigarettes to members of the Cherokee tribe without a tribal permit. The tribe says it's fighting the Walmart lawsuit in court because the federal law doesn't apply to tribes, and it wants the government to enforce the ban. The Cherokee tribe claims it's being singled out by Walmart because it's one of the few tribes that doesn't have a tribe president, meaning the tribe isn't legally bound to follow the law. The suit also claims Walmart is violating a federal law that prohibits states from regulating the sale of cigarettes to non-members. The Cherokee tribe is suing for three things: the right to sell cigarettes, to have the government enforce the ban, and to have the government stop Walmart from selling cigarettes to non-members. Walmart says it's complying with the law and has stopped selling cigarettes to members of the Cherokee tribe. The company says it's also working with the tribe to get rid of the rule.

– A new law in California allows seniors to deduct the entirety of their home's property tax, even if they don't make any money on the property, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The law was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown last week and is set to go into effect Jan. 1. "This is a win-win for seniors and for the state," says Rep. Steve Glazer, who sponsored the bill. "It allows them to keep their home and it also gives the state a little money." The law applies to seniors who are 65 and older and who pay the state's 3.9% property tax. The law also allows seniors who make less than $30,000 a year to deduct the entirety of their property tax, even if they don't make any money on the property. The law is set to save the state an estimated $115 million a year, according to the Chronicle. The law was inspired by a law from 1998 that allowed seniors to deduct the entirety of their property tax.

– The EPA is giving a big push to small communities that want to do something about pollution, but they'll have to do it on their own. The agency is directing $50 million to 31 states to help them do just that, reports the Los Angeles Times. The money is being doled out under the Project SEARCH Act of 2000, which Congress passed to help small communities deal with environmental issues. The EPA says the grants will go to projects that are "demonstrably necessary" to reducing pollution, and that the applications will be judged on how well they meet those criteria. "We're trying to make it as easy as possible for small communities to take control of their own environmental destiny," says a EPA official. The agency says it will give out the money to state and local governments, not the federal government, and that it will work with communities to make sure they have the appropriate number of representatives on local councils to make sure the grants are distributed fairly. The New York Times, however, notes that the money is being directed to projects that are either already underway or will be soon, and that the EPA is not expected to make any decisions on which projects to fund until the end of the year. (The agency has set aside $100 million for the effort.)

– The federal government is supposed to be diverse, but when it comes to hiring senior executives, minorities make up just 22%, and women just 29%. So President Obama has signed a law that will require federal agencies to do a better job of hiring minorities and women, the Hill reports. The law, which also calls for better training of executives, is part of the administration's "My Government Is My Home" initiative, which is designed to boost the number of women and minorities in government jobs. "We need to do more to diversify the executive branch," said Obama in his weekly radio address yesterday. "We need to do it in a way that is consistent with our values." The law will require agencies to have a diversity office that looks into hiring decisions, and to set aside at least 20% of their executive-branch slots for minorities and women.

– President Obama has signed a bill that will see the feds pumping billions of dollars into community banks to boost lending to small businesses. The measure is part of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, and it gives the Treasury Department the power to direct funds to community banks that have trouble getting credit from the federal government, the New York Times reports. "The financial crisis of 2008 only served to exacerbate efforts by entrepreneurs to access capital for the purpose of creating jobs and improving economic outcomes in the community," the bill states. The measure is expected to create thousands of jobs, and it will help small businesses that have been unable to get credit in the past, Obama says. The program is expected to help small businesses that are struggling because of the recession, but it will also help those that have been helped by the financial crisis, the Times notes.

– The EPA has issued a new rule that could spell the end for thousands of people in the Rio Grande Valley who rely on a dirty and toxic water supply, reports the Albuquerque Journal. The rule, which the New York Times calls "brutal," declares that colonias—small, often impoverished, Mexican-American communities near the US-Mexico border—are officially considered "non-essential" for drinking water, sanitation, or economic development. The rule, which will take effect in March, is designed to make it easier for people in the region to apply for federal assistance to clean up the water supply. The rule will require that people who live in or near the area have access to safe drinking water, and it will also require that wastewater treatment plants be inspected for contamination. The rule is expected to help thousands of people who rely on the Rio Grande for their water supply and are struggling to pay bills, reports the Journal. "I'm very pleased that they're taking this action," says Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, who introduced the bill to make the rule official. "It's a big deal."

– The Department of Transportation is set to release a report today on its plan to expand the freight rail system from the Gulf of Mexico to New York City, with the goal of increasing capacity by 25% by the end of the decade. The New York Times reports the plan includes borrowing of up to $12 billion to build new stations, track, and crossings in New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The plan also calls for the elimination of some costs, including those related to the movement of cars between crossing points. The Times notes the cost of the project is expected to be closer to $15 billion. The plan is expected to be a major headache for the New York City Department of Transportation, which has been trying to borrow money to expand the city's commuter rail system since 2011. The New York Times reports the city's transportation department has had difficulty finding financing for the project, and it has already defaulted on more than $100 million in loans. The Department of Transportation's plan is expected to be a major headache for the parent company of the New York City Transit Authority, which is also seeking to borrow for the project. The company's chief executive says the plan is a good one, but he's not sure the DOT will be able to find the funds. "

– The US and Mexico have a shared concern about the health of residents on both sides of the border, and a new law aims to address that. The Border Health Security Act of 2015—which President Obama signed into law on Friday—calls for the US-Mexico Border Health Commission to come up with a plan to address health issues along the nearly 2,000-mile border, including things like tuberculosis, diabetes, and obesity, the CBC reports. The commission will also be tasked with helping to prevent the spread of diseases between the two countries. The law's language is a bit more specific than previous efforts, the New York Times notes, but it still appears to be the first time the commission has had the authority to set aside money for such a plan. The commission will also be given the authority to set up a public health task force, the Times reports. The task force will be made up of officials from the two countries, as well as experts from the medical community, and it will be tasked with recommending ways to improve the health of border residents. The law also calls for the two countries to work together on a "border health preparedness council," the Times notes. The task force will be able to apply for up to $5 million in grants, the CBC reports. (A

– A new federal law is offering a big tax break to people who invest in alternative energy sources, including wind and solar power. The law, which went into effect in January, offers a $6,000 credit for each "renewable energy property" that is installed on a taxpayer's property, the Wall Street Journal reports. The credit is worth up to 35% of the taxpayer's expenditures for such property, which can be used for non-residential purposes. The law is designed to help the burgeoning alternative energy industry, which has seen a surge in investment in wind and solar power in recent years. "The tax credit is a win-win for both the taxpayer and the industry," says an analyst with the American Coalition for Clean Energy. "It gives them the money to invest in alternative energy sources and it also gives the industry a leg up on competitors who are trying to get into the wind power business." The law is being hailed by renewable-energy advocates, but not everyone is thrilled. "The credit is a nice perk, but it's not enough to make up for the lack of tax incentives for the industry," says a director with the Sierra Club. "We need a more aggressive approach."

– The acid rain that has plagued parts of the Northeast and Midwest for decades is finally coming back to haunt us—but this time it's thanks to new environmental rules. The EPA has issued regulations to cut emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which are linked to acid rain, reports the New York Times. The old rules, which were originally aimed at reducing mercury emissions, were overturned by the Supreme Court in 2008, and the new ones will take effect in about a year. The old rules "may be necessary to protect sensitive regional ecosystems," says the EPA in its rationale for the new rules. But the industry is fighting the regulations, saying they'll cost jobs and put off investment in green technologies. "The EPA is putting new rules on the books that will create more jobs and make our country more competitive," says the president of the New York State Energy Research and Development Association. The Times notes that the regulations will help the Northeast meet new air-quality standards set by the EPA in June. The rules will cut emissions of the two pollutants by about 70%, but the industry says that's not enough to make a difference. "We're not going to make the East Coast as clean as it was before," says the president of the New York State Energy Research

– The IRS has a new target for its ire: cooperative societies. The Wall Street Journal reports that the agency has issued a notice to more than 100 such societies, warning that they may be violating a 1986 law that prohibits them from "creating, by and between themselves, service organizations owned and controlled exclusively by small employer benefit arrangements." The letter, which the IRS says was issued under the auspices of the Internal Revenue Code's Section 414, notes that cooperative societies are "not subject to the same tax treatment as other employers," and that they may be subject to penalties for not having a retirement plan for their employees. The cooperatives are defined as "persons owned and democratically controlled by a cooperative organization that is owned and democratically controlled by its shareholders." The letter, which the Journal notes was issued in mid-June, was apparently prompted by a case in which a cooperative society in Massachusetts set up a retirement plan for its employees, who were not members. The IRS says the cooperative had not established a retirement plan for the employees, and that the employees were not enrolled in the plan. The cooperatives say they have set up retirement plans for employees who were not members, but that they will not be penalized for not having one. "We believe that cooperative societies are subject to the

– The federal government is giving West Virginia's biggest city a little something it really needs: money. The Charleston Gazette reports the city has received more than $3 million from the feds to help it buy equipment and build infrastructure. The money is coming from the State and Local Government Economic Empowerment Act of 2011, which gives state and local governments in the state the ability to borrow interest-free. The program was put into place to help small cities pay for things like roads, bridges, and tunnels. But the Charleston City Council voted against it last week, arguing that the money is being used to pay for things the city doesn't need and that the loan is interest-free only. "We’re not paying interest on a loan we don’t have," says Mayor Joe Charleston. "We’re paying interest on a loan we don’t have." The city has used more than $1 million of the $5 million it received from the feds to buy equipment like excavators, graders, and pipes. The money is being paid back with interest over 30 years. The city says it will use the rest of the money to pay off other debts, like a $1.3 million loan for road repair. But Charleston says it will use the rest of the money to pay off other

– The Senate’s climate change bill is getting a warm welcome from environmentalists today, with at least 12 senators signing an open letter to President Obama. The letter, which can be seen in full here, calls the bill “a cynical political ploy designed to stall and defeat” climate change legislation, Politico reports. It also says the bill would “put millions of Americans’ jobs at risk.” The letter comes as the Senate prepares to vote on the Kyoto Protocol next week, and as the White House has been pushing for a program that would give companies tax credits for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The House has passed a similar bill, but Senate Democrats are unlikely to allow it to reach the floor. The letter is likely to draw attention because it was signed by 11 senators, including co-sponsor Tom Harkin of Iowa, who is also a climate change skeptic, the Hill reports.

– The estate tax is back in the news, and this time it's not because of the Bush tax cuts. Rather, it's because of a law passed by Congress in 2008 that has been dinged by lawmakers ever since. The law, known as the Sensible Estate Tax Act of 2008, allows the tax to be levied on estates that are worth more than $5 million per year. The law was intended to help the poor, but it has turned out to be a tax on the rich, especially since the 2008 recession. The Washington Post explains the law: "The law allows the tax to be levied on estates that are worth more than $5 million per year, even though the 2008 recession hit many Americans hard and many of those estates are in the top 1% of income earners." The law has been especially dinged by the wealthy, who tend to be the biggest beneficiaries. The New York Times reports that the top 1% of income earners pay an average of 13.9% in estate tax, while the top 1% of taxpayers pay an average of 14.2%. The law has been dinged by lawmakers of both parties, and the Wall Street Journal reports that lawmakers are working on a compromise that would allow the tax to be levied on estates worth less than $5 million per

– A slaughterhouse in Pennsylvania has been slapped with a cease-and-desist order after officials found it was selling meat that had been recalled due to a potentially deadly listeria outbreak, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Officials at the Hill-Stealing Meats in Reading found the meat—which had been labeled "Best If Used-By"—was being sold to people in at least five states. The recall was ordered after officials found the company was selling meat that had been recalled from almost 300 processing plants in 41 states due to a listeria outbreak. The Hill-Stealing Meats says it has "vigorously" fought the recall and is "working with the USDA to ensure that the meat sold is safe to eat." The company says it has also taken steps to make its operations safer, including adding food-safety inspectors and taking steps to stop the sale of affected products. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture says it will be conducting a criminal investigation of the company, which has been sued by several people who bought affected meat. (A list of recalled meat products can be found here.)

– The Pentagon's plan to build a $1.4 billion research center in California—complete with an observation deck, a rocket launchpad, and a vast parking lot—has been met with a "mathematically incoherent" report from the Government Accountability Office, reports the Washington Post. The report, which the Pentagon says will be released Tuesday, says the center will be the largest such facility in the world and the first in the continental US. It also says the Pentagon has overspent on such projects by more than $5 billion since 2009. The report says the Pentagon has overspent on other large facilities by as much as $5 billion, including a $5 billion center for space-related education at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, which was completed in 2010 and is scheduled to be finished in 2018. The GAO report says the Pentagon has also overspent on other projects by more than $5 billion, including a $5 billion facility for space-related education at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, which was completed in 2010 and is scheduled to be finished in 2018.

– The Department of Housing and Urban Development has been ordered to release the names of people hired to run its programs—including those that provide low-income housing—after a federal judge ruled that the agency had failed to provide the requested information, the Washington Post reports. The judge said he was "troubled" by the lack of specificity in the data, which was provided to him by the department's inspector general. The problem, according to the Post, is that the data is provided by private companies, not the department. The department says it has provided the information to the inspector general's office, but the judge says the department has not done so. The department says it will comply with the ruling. The law that set up the database requires the department to provide the information "only to the extent necessary to verify the employment and income of individuals described in subparagraphs permitted," the Post notes. The law also requires the department to provide the information "after removal of personal identifiers." The department says it will comply.

– The Pentagon is working to do more to prevent veterans from suffering from PTSD. It's set to announce a series of initiatives today to that end, including a program to teach medical professionals how to recognize and treat the condition, reports the Los Angeles Times. The effort is part of a 2006 law that promised to do so, and it's not clear whether the new program will be more ambitious or smaller. The Pentagon has previously announced that it will create a program to help veterans transition back to civilian life, but it's not clear whether that will include PTSD. The new initiative will also include a program to help veterans who have suffered from substance abuse, reports the New York Times.

– When Bank of America was bailed out in 2008, it did so without warning employees, retirees, or shareholders. Now, the bank is in trouble again, and it's not because of the collapse, but because of a new rule that requires it to alert employees before paying them huge bonuses, reports the Wall Street Journal. The rule, which takes effect in March, is designed to prevent executive compensation from spiking as the company tries to recover from its near-collapse. The big question is whether it will affect individual employees, who are worried about their pensions, or whether it will have a big impact on the entire financial industry. The bank is worried because it has more than $20 billion in debt, and it has been reporting disappointing quarterly results. The big question is whether the new rule will affect individual employees, who are worried about their pensions, or whether it will have a big impact on the entire financial industry. The Journal has more on the new rule here.
