# W266_Project

There are 3 notebooks in this repository:
All the notebooks uses shared google drive for storing and retrieving datasets and code across the notebooks. The root folder for this project is '/content/drive/My Drive/W266_Project'

## w266_Project_initial_setup.ipynb
   You can follow this notebook to setup the drive space and codebase needed for rest of the activities. The models needed for evaluation are installed at '/content/drive/My Drive/W266_Project/ckpt'.

## W266_Project_Model_Evaluation.ipynb
   This contains the steps needed to run evaluation of various models against tensor text summarization datasets. All evaluation results are written to a folder named '/content/drive/My Drive/W266_Project/pegasus/metrics_and_logs'.
   
3. W266_Project_Report_Generation_And_Charts.ipynb
   In this notebook, we will generate reports on various metrics from the logs collected in the previous notebook and present to the user.

Apart from the notebooks, there are 2 folders:

## logs
   This folder contains the evaluation logs for all the runs we performed.

## reports
